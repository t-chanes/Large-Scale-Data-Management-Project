Connectome Coordination Facility II,RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY,10550201,"MARCUS, DANIEL SCOTT",DANIEL SCOTT.MARCUS@washingtonuniversity,Adult;Aging;Algorithms;Architecture;Behavioral;Brain;Child;Communities,"Project Summary This project will continue operation of the Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on the successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities; (ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high quality imaging data; and (iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF builds on these accomplishments and serves the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with those of the HCP. To this end, we have established a help desk whose support functions include transfer of data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These services include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project’s behavioral data are obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This entails coordination with data contributors to develop and maitain mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database. The data from each study include the acquired images and all data associated with the project’s behavioral battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures based on existing HCP methods are executed to generate quality metrics that are published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines are then run in order to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database. A third aim is to maintain the existing data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it to include connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded under the Connectomes Related to Human Diseases program. Together, these three aims enable the CCF to serve a central hub for connectomics data aggregation and harmonization. The CCF’s suite of harmonization services from data acquisition through data sharing ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The resulting database enables the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain function in health and disease."

Metabolic regulation of human DNA methylation clocks,Unavailable,10543439,"PICARD, MARTIN ","MARTIN.PICARD@newyorkstatepsychiatricinstitutedbaresearchfoundationformentalhygiene,inc",Acceleration;Acute;Address;Age;Aging;Algorithms;Animal Model;Behavior,"There are substantial inter-individual differences in biological aging trajectories, but the origin of these differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e., the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2, p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of cellular aging in a human system."
Project 2: Cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF) as a driver of liver cancer and target for intervention during aging,Unavailable,10488721,"ADAMS, PETER D.",PETER D..ADAMS@sanfordburnhamprebysmedicaldiscoveryinstitute,Acute;Age;Aging;Antitumor Response;Automobile Driving;Autophagocytosis;Benign;Cell Aging,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2 The incidences of liver cancer (primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) are increasing and disease outcome is poor. Consequently, there is an urgent need for new therapies and preventive strategies. Age is a major risk for HCC and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a chronic liver disease that encompasses a progressive range of disorders of increasing severity and risk of HCC, from benign fatty liver (steatosis), to inflammatory non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. Aging is accompanied by many molecular, cellular and tissue changes that are candidate drivers of NAFLD and HCC, including the “hallmarks of aging” that are dysregulated with age in diverse tissues and organisms; for example, changes to mitochondria, metabolism, the epigenome, accumulation of senescent cells, inflammation and immune changes. Cell senescence is caused by a range of cellular stresses and characterized by an irreversible proliferation arrest and a potent pro-inflammatory phenotype, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Recently, we showed that in senescent cells, mitochondria dysfunction signals to evict fragments of chromatin from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF)) via a nucleus-to- cytoplasmic blebbing process. CCF are sensed by the anti-viral cytoplasmic DNA sensing apparatus to activate NFkB and the SASP. The SASP of senescent cells includes interferons, a family of cytokines involved in cell intrinsic anti-viral mechanisms, control of cell proliferation, inflammation and adaptive immunity, and tumor suppressive and oncogenic processes. Although SASP and acute IFN signaling have important benefits, chronic SASP and IFN signaling can be detrimental. As a source of chronic inflammation, SASP promotes tissue aging and disease, including liver cancer. Chronic IFN signaling can promote immunosuppression, in part by upregulation of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1. Based on unpublished data, we hypothesize that accumulation of CCF in aged and/or senescent liver hepatocytes drives chronic activation of IFN signaling, expression of IFN target genes and immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1. We further hypothesize that this, in turn, generates an immunosuppressed liver microenvironment that is permissive for transformation of old hepatocytes. By antagonizing this immunosuppressive signaling pathway, we hypothesize that several different types of intervention can prevent liver cancer during aging. Completion of these Specific Aims will promote novel interventions to prevent HCC."

The CADRC represents a rich clinical and research community and an estimated 220,000 Ohioans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related dementias (ADRD). The CADRC has 8 Cores and a Research Education Component designed to create the foundation that will enhance the research efforts of the Northeast Ohio AD/ADRD research community, as well as add unique value to the national Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRC) program and other national and international research programs. The CADRC is focused on participants that will help us understand the pathobiology of clinical and pathological heterogeneity observed in dementia including atypical and amnestic AD, dementia with Lewy bodies, cognitively normal individuals with different levels of genetic risk for AD, and diversity of participant populations (Clinical and Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Cores). To support the CADRC goals, the focus will be on deep phenotyping of participants with longitudinal and systematic cognitive, behavioral and motor characterization (Clinical Core), genetic and biofluid biomarker collection and analysis (Biomarker Core), imaging (Neuroimaging Core), and autopsy after death (Neuropathology Core). Results will be shared with the research community in a timely and regular manner to allow other investigators to benefit from the CADRC efforts (Data Management and Statistics Core). In addition, the CADRC will train the next generation of investigators utilizing a rigorous and well-designed Research Education Component, support translation of new laboratory findings through the Translational Therapeutics Core, and support high risk/high gain projects through the developmental program as a part of the Administrative Core. The ultimate goals are to advance the precision medicine approach to dementia diagnosis and treatment, support the development of early stage investigators, assist all stages of investigators with tools for performing human-based research, and better engage underrepresented populations in AD/ADRD research."

The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context."

A screen for small molecule inhibitors of CCF to suppress senescence-associated inflammation,Unavailable,10236352,"ADAMS, PETER D.",PETER D..ADAMS@sanfordburnhamprebysmedicaldiscoveryinstitute,Aging;Animal Model;Antiviral Agents;Cell Aging;Cell Nucleus;Cell Proliferation;Cells;Cellular Stress,"PROJECT SUMMARY Cellular senescence is a bona fide tumor suppression mechanism but also a cause of cell and tissue aging. Senescence is caused by a range of cellular stresses and characterized by an irreversible proliferation arrest and a potent pro-inflammatory phenotype, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescence-associated proliferation arrest and SASP cooperate in tumor suppression, by arresting proliferation of damaged pre-malignant cells and promoting immune clearance of the damaged cells. However, over the longer term, as a source of chronic inflammation, SASP also promotes tissue aging and disease. Consequently, there is currently much effort devoted to development of pharmacologic approaches to eliminate senescent cells to promote healthy aging. However, these so-called senolytic drugs tend to show unwanted toxicities. An alternative, inherently less toxic approach, is to specifically inhibit the pro-aging chronic SASP. Evidence indicates that this can be achieved without impairing tumor suppressive senescence-associated proliferation arrest. Towards an understanding of SASP and targets for its inhibition, we recently showed that senescent cells shed fragments of nuclear chromatin into the cytoplasm, so-called cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), via a nucleus-to-cytoplasmic blebbing process. CCF initiate SASP in senescent cells, via activation of the anti-viral cytoplasmic DNA sensing apparatus to activate NFkB and hence SASP. Preliminary data indicate that formation of CCF is triggered by dysfunctional mitochondria which signal to the nucleus via a retrograde mitochondrial ROS-JNK kinase-53BP1 pathway to nuclear MRE11 exonuclease, whose activity is required for CCF formation. Accordingly, inhibitors of mitochondrial ROS, JNK, MRE11 and HDAC inhibitors (which appear to act indirectly by improving mitochondria function) all suppress CCF and SASP. To identify additional tool compounds to probe the mechanism of CCF formation and/or approved drugs as candidates for repurposing as anti-SASP/pro-healthy aging interventions, we have established an automated high content screen for inhibitors of CCF. We will screen focused collections of mechanistically well-defined small molecules and drug repurposing libraries to identify and validate novel inhibitors of CCF and SASP. Completion of these Specific Aims will identify valuable tool compounds for further mechanistic investigation of CCF and SASP, and also identify lead compounds for repurposing as anti-SASP/pro-healthy aging interventions in humans."

Metabolic regulation of human DNA methylation clocks,Unavailable,10137170,"PICARD, MARTIN ","MARTIN.PICARD@newyorkstatepsychiatricinstitutedbaresearchfoundationformentalhygiene,inc",Acceleration;Acute;Address;Age;Aging;Algorithms;Animal Model;Behavior,"There are substantial inter-individual differences in biological aging trajectories, but the origin of these differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e., the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2, p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of cellular aging in a human system."
Establishing Common Coordinate Framework for Quantitative Cell Census in Developing Mouse Brains,NEUROSCIENCES,10088508,"KIM, YONGSOO ",YONGSOO.KIM@pennsylvaniastateunivhersheymedctr,3-Dimensional;Acute;Address;Adopted;Adult;Age;Anatomy;Animal Model,"Abstract Brain development is characterized by a diverse set of cell types that are born and connected into rapidly growing complex 3D structures across time. Quantitative understanding of cell type composition and distribution in different brain regions provides fundamental knowledge about the building blocks of the brain and serves as an essential baseline with which to assess changes that may occur in brain disorders. The importance of this information is reflected by the significant effort among the neuroscience community, including the creation of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, to improve our understanding of cell type compositions across different brain regions in the adult mouse brain. These efforts have been made possible and accelerated by technological advances in high-resolution 3D imaging coupled with computational analysis methods that can reveal cell type arrangement in the brain with unprecedented detail. For example, we developed a quantitative brain mapping method to uncover the spatial arrangement of GABAergic neuron subtypes in the adult mouse brain. For the adult mouse brain, the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) currently serves as the standard atlas resource with which to map and integrate results from different studies. The neuroscience community, on the other hand, does not have similar CCFs for the developing mouse brain. The lack of developmental CCFs significantly hinders progress on cell type mapping of the developing mouse brain by limiting the reproducibility and integration of data from different studies. To address this deficiency, we have assembled a highly synergistic, multi-institutional team with complementary skill sets to create developmental CCFs with associated ontology and true 3D anatomical labels while also demonstrating the application of our CCFs by generating quantitative mappings of GABAergic neurons in the developing mouse brain. Toward this end, we will first utilize MRI and light sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) to develop high-resolution developmental CCFs at seven different developmental time points (E11.5, E13.5, E15.5, E18.5, P4, P14, and P56) with different cellular features, including total cell density, myelination, and neurovasculature. Second, we will create true 3D anatomical labels for the CCFs based on cellular and gene expression information, and build a comprehensive ontology that will allow anatomical region changes to be linked across development and maturation. Lastly, we will generate a cellular-resolution quantitative map of GABAergic neuronal subtypes using tissue clearing and LSFM imaging in developing mouse brains, which will serve as a substantial data resource to accelerate developmental neuroscience discovery. The successful completion of this project will enable a broad field of scientists to leverage modern brain mapping technologies more effectively in studying the developing mouse brain."
A screen for small molecule inhibitors of CCF to suppress senescence-associated inflammation,Unavailable,10041218,"ADAMS, PETER D.",PETER D..ADAMS@sanfordburnhamprebysmedicaldiscoveryinstitute,Aging;Animal Model;Antiviral Agents;Biological Assay;Cell Aging;Cell Nucleus;Cell Proliferation;Cells,"PROJECT SUMMARY Cellular senescence is a bona fide tumor suppression mechanism but also a cause of cell and tissue aging. Senescence is caused by a range of cellular stresses and characterized by an irreversible proliferation arrest and a potent pro-inflammatory phenotype, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescence-associated proliferation arrest and SASP cooperate in tumor suppression, by arresting proliferation of damaged pre-malignant cells and promoting immune clearance of the damaged cells. However, over the longer term, as a source of chronic inflammation, SASP also promotes tissue aging and disease. Consequently, there is currently much effort devoted to development of pharmacologic approaches to eliminate senescent cells to promote healthy aging. However, these so-called senolytic drugs tend to show unwanted toxicities. An alternative, inherently less toxic approach, is to specifically inhibit the pro-aging chronic SASP. Evidence indicates that this can be achieved without impairing tumor suppressive senescence-associated proliferation arrest. Towards an understanding of SASP and targets for its inhibition, we recently showed that senescent cells shed fragments of nuclear chromatin into the cytoplasm, so-called cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), via a nucleus-to-cytoplasmic blebbing process. CCF initiate SASP in senescent cells, via activation of the anti-viral cytoplasmic DNA sensing apparatus to activate NFkB and hence SASP. Preliminary data indicate that formation of CCF is triggered by dysfunctional mitochondria which signal to the nucleus via a retrograde mitochondrial ROS-JNK kinase-53BP1 pathway to nuclear MRE11 exonuclease, whose activity is required for CCF formation. Accordingly, inhibitors of mitochondrial ROS, JNK, MRE11 and HDAC inhibitors (which appear to act indirectly by improving mitochondria function) all suppress CCF and SASP. To identify additional tool compounds to probe the mechanism of CCF formation and/or approved drugs as candidates for repurposing as anti-SASP/pro-healthy aging interventions, we have established an automated high content screen for inhibitors of CCF. We will screen focused collections of mechanistically well-defined small molecules and drug repurposing libraries to identify and validate novel inhibitors of CCF and SASP. Completion of these Specific Aims will identify valuable tool compounds for further mechanistic investigation of CCF and SASP, and also identify lead compounds for repurposing as anti-SASP/pro-healthy aging interventions in humans."

One aim is to provide consultation and support services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with those of the HCP. To this end, we have established a help desk whose support functions include transfer of data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These services include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project’s behavioral data are obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This entails coordination with data contributors to develop and maitain mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database. The data from each study include the acquired images and all data associated with the project’s behavioral battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures based on existing HCP methods are executed to generate quality metrics that are published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines are then run in order to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database. A third aim is to maintain the existing data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it to include connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded under the Connectomes Related to Human Diseases program. Together, these three aims enable the CCF to serve a central hub for connectomics data aggregation and harmonization. The CCF’s suite of harmonization services from data acquisition through data sharing ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The resulting database enables the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain function in health and disease."
Metabolic regulation of human DNA methylation clocks,Unavailable,9945660,"PICARD, MARTIN ","MARTIN.PICARD@newyorkstatepsychiatricinstitutedbaresearchfoundationformentalhygiene,inc",Acceleration;Acute;Address;Age;Aging;Algorithms;Animal Model;Behavior,"There are substantial inter-individual differences in biological aging trajectories, but the origin of these differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e., the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2, p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of cellular aging in a human system."

The CADRC would represent a rich clinical and research community and an estimated 45,000 Nevadans and 220,000 Ohioans who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Currently there is no Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in either Ohio or Nevada. The CADRC will bring together the considerable expertise from the medical and academic communities in northeast Ohio and Nevada to focus on one of the largest health care crises facing our country. The CADRC will be focused on the increasingly recognized clinical and pathologic heterogeneity observed in AD and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD). The CADRC will create an infrastructure to help speed up the research efforts of local, national and international investigators. The CADRC will participate in the national Alzheimer’s Centers program and contribute to the “big science” possible when centers from around the country collaborate. We will recruit subject samples that northeast Ohio and Nevada are well situated to study due to unique regional populations or studies (dementia with Lewy bodies, repetitive head trauma, and rapidly progressive AD identified by the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center,) or relevant to our understanding of AD and related dementias (cognitively normal older individuals, AD and mild cognitive impairment). We will add value to the evaluation of these subject samples by adding biofluid collection and analysis and cutting edge imaging. Special emphasis will also be placed on enrollment of minority populations not often well-studied. We are quite encouraged by the collaborative spirit already demonstrated by those participating in the CADRC planning from CWRU, CCF, MHS, UH, and LSVA and from the support we have received from the northeast Ohio and Las Vegas communities. We believe this is a great opportunity for both Ohio and Nevada to contribute to the greater efforts of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers program and to improve the treatments for these devastating disorders."

Major advances by the HCP include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities; (ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high quality imaging data; and (iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF will build on these accomplishments and serve the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with those of the HCP. The effort will establish a help desk whose support functions will include transfer of data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These services will include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project's behavioral data are obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This will entail coordination with data contributors to develop mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database. The data from each study will include the unprocessed images, minimally preprocessed data generated by each project's internal pipelines, and all data associated with the project's behavioral battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures will be implemented based on existing HCP methods to generate quality metrics that will be published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines will be run in order to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database. A third aim is to maintain the existing ConnectomeDB data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it to include Connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded as U01 projects under the Connectomes Related to Human Diseases RFA. The platform will be developed and operated following policies and procedures vetted by the HCP to ensure the privacy and security of the data hosted by the CCF. Together, these three aims will establish the CCF as a central hub for connectomics data aggregation and sharing. The CCF's suite of harmonization services from data acquisition through data sharing will ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets.

A Comprehensive Center for Mouse Brain Cell Atlas,Unavailable,9415765,"HUANG, Z JOSH",Z JOSH.HUANG@coldspringharborlaboratory,Address;Anatomy;Atlases;Axon;BRAIN initiative;Big Data;Bioinformatics;Brain,"OVERALL SUMMARY The BRAIN initiative cell census network calls for large-­scale, comprehensive approaches to define the composition of the mammalian brain at the cellular level and using an overall strategy that integrates multimodal information (morphology, connectivity, molecules etc..) within a Common Coordinated Framework (CCF) to enable distribution, validation, integration and use of the atlas by the community. The BICCN challenge is enormous and remains a scientific problem requiring new discovery, continuous innovation in methods, technologies and pipeline of analysis. Given the unparalleled cellular diversity of the mouse brain and the need for an informed cell classification scheme, we propose here an ambitious project that addresses both the need for scale (coverage of millions of cells) and depth of analysis of each cell and, further, that integrates molecular and anatomical information. To address this challenge, we have assembled a collaborative group of key knowledge leaders and innovators across various fields of neuroscience, genomics, and technology. First, we will apply transformative new droplet scRNA sequencing technologies and next-­generation computational methods and data processing pipelines to compile a whole brain cell transcriptome atlas on a massive scale (millions of single cells and nuclei collected brainwide). This effort will generate an unprecedented inventory of cell type composition and distribution for the mouse brain within the CCF. Second, we will generate a forebrain neuronal atlas that will integrate detailed molecular information (to saturation) of anatomically defined populations with high-­resolution morphological and connectivity information to provide an in-­depth picture of a core portion of the mammalian brain. We will also generate highly specific driver lines for precise marking of cell types and to enable adaptive methods that refine cell sampling to achieve completeness. Finally, realizing the need for innovation in technology to enable work that is made difficult because it requires both scale and precision, we will devote key effort to develop new integrated technological platforms that combine multiple methods to relate neuronal connectivity with transcriptomes and cellular distribution at an unprecedented scale. Our Data Core will integrate, store, and manage multi-­modal datasets and provide bioinformatics and computational expertise;; and our Administrative Core, will coordinate and oversee Center-­wide activities. Our effort is unprecedented for scale and coverage, and it relies on a team of investigators with demonstrated academic track records of innovation in technology and neurobiology, working in an environment that allows for implementation of massive pipelines for production workflow. This will guarantee progressive evolution and innovation of methods, experimental design and analysis to meet future challenges and succeed at generating a comprehensive molecular and anatomical atlas of the mouse brain."

Connectome Coordination Facility,NEUROSCIENCES,8988864,"VAN ESSEN, DAVID C",DAVID C.VAN ESSEN@washingtonuniversity,Adult;Algorithms;Behavioral;Brain;Communities;Computer software;Consultations;Data,"﻿ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will establish a Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on recent successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which has acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities; (ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high quality imaging data; and (iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF will build on these accomplishments and serve the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with those of the HCP. The effort will establish a help desk whose support functions will include transfer of data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These services will include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project's behavioral data are obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This will entail coordination with data contributors to develop mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database. The data from each study will include the unprocessed images, minimally preprocessed data generated by each project's internal pipelines, and all data associated with the project's behavioral battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures will be implemented based on existing HCP methods to generate quality metrics that will be published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines will be run in order to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database.

The Cell Culture Facility (CCF) serves as a customized pay-for-service Facility that provides expertise, technical support, reagents, equipment, liquid nitrogen storage, and training to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of using mammalian cell culture in Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) laboratories. This Facility provides technical assistance and consultation services in tissue culture techniques, centralized liquid nitrogen banking, mycoplasma screening services, the preparation of custom and standard culture media and supplements, performance testing of fetal bovine serum, cell propagation, and technical support and supplies for mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell transfection and culture. Major efforts by the CCF include carrying out technically challenging techniques, such as the establishment of primary cell cultures from patient or animal tissue samples, hybridoma fusion and cloning services to generate monoclonal antibodies, and establishing gene ""knockout"" or ""knock-in"" Embryonic Stem (ES) cells to generate genetically manipulated mice. Since the last review the Center established a governing body for the CCSG supported Shared Resources called the Facility Parent Oversight Committee (FPOC). The FPOC recommended in 2008 that the CCF incorporate the Hybridoma Facility, which was previously approved as a distinct CCSG Facility. This merger has provided operational efficiencies by centrally locating the merged staff. Economic efficiencies have been achieved by reducing total staff by 2.05 FTE, and by presenting a reduced overall request from the CCSG. The merged CCSG budget request is $19,724 less than the combined levels approved for previously two distinct cores at the last review. In 2009, the Facility served 47 investigators with peer-reviewed funding. Service was provided to all five of the Center's CCSG Research Programs. Peer-reviewed, funded research accounted for 95.3% of CCF usage in calendar year 2009. Based on an annual quality survey administered by the FPOC, the Facility is highly regarded among faculty users, and received an ""Outstanding to Excellent"" rating at the last CCSG review. In the past five years, the demand for CCF services has remained strong. Importantly, the Facility supplies the FCCC community with valuable on-site expertise for a host of established cell culture protocols, consultation in the design and evaluation of experiments, training in cell culture methodologies, high quality culture media and supplements, and adaptable assistance delivered in a cost-effective manner."

Meth users infected with HIV usually present a more severe form of neuroAIDS, due to effects on neurons. IT is known that free radicals participate in the enhancement of brain pathology, but the cell types as well as pathways affected by Meth that lead to free-radical mediated stress. The hypothesis behind this proposal is that Meth interacts with cell types other than neurons will be explored, particularly regarding its potential to induce and/or modulate reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. We will investigate the action of methamphetamine (Meth) on oxidative metabolism, directly on macrophages, and on other cell types in vitro, as well as in vivo, in conditions of co-morbid factor interaction. For that we will examine the action of Meth on cell lines, by investigating how the drug affects the intensity and quality of the oxidative burst, and searching for genes within ROI and RNI pathways that exhibit transcriptional pattern changes upon Meth exposure. Such transcriptional changes will be validated by looking for similar changes in cells obtained from Meth-treated animals infected with SIV, which have been previously characterized for CNS disease parameters. The results from this project will offer important clues on the participation of Meth in pathology mediated by oxidative stress by acting on ROI and RNI induction pathways, not only in the Central Nervous System, but also in peripheral organs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will investigate the action of methamphetamine (Meth) on oxidative metabolism, directly on macrophages, and on other cell types in vitro, as well as in vivo in conditions of co-morbid factor interaction. The hypothesis behind this proposal is that Meth affects the intensity and quality of the oxidative burst by acting directly on macrophages and/or glial cells, in addition to its action on neurons, contributing to the development of pathology mediated by oxidative stress, not only in the Central Nervous System, but also in peripheral organs. Initially, we will focus on the effect of meth on various human and mouse macrophage (THP1, RAW264.7), microglia (MG5, EOC 2), astrocyte (C8-D1A, CCF-STTG1), and neuronal (SH-SY5Y, SK- N-MC) cell lines, regarding the production of O2_, H2O2, and other reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), as well as Reactive Nitrogen Intermediates (RNI) using various chromogenic methods. Mitochondria activity upon interaction with meth will be also addressed on cells stimulated with Meth. Following a characterization of the different cell lines regarding production of free radicals and mitochondrial changes in reaction to Meth, we will choose good responders to investigate transcriptional changes on molecules within ROI and RNI pathways, caused by action of Meth. For that we will use multiplex technology, as well as enzymatic checkpoint inhibition strategies. These approaches will help dissect the molecular basis of respiratory burst induction by Meth, and will distinguish whether Meth interferes over mitochodria, peroxisome, or both. Following the in vitro approach using cell lines, we intend to validate findings in the context of pathology. We will use cryopreserved cells and tissues from monkeys infected with SIV (as a model for HIV infection, a common co-morbid condition) subjected to a Meth treatment schedule. We will identify transcriptionally altered oxidative pathways on cryopreserved brain and peripheral tissues derived from SIV-infected Meth-treated monkeys by qRT-PCR. This brings relevance to pathology in humans. The present proposal will identify the basis of oxidative stress in the brain and other organs in Meth users. Meth is one of the most growing street drugs of abuse, exposing users to HIV infection, and potentially facilitating the penetration of virus across the blood brain barrier (BBB) into the brain. In this proposal we will dissect mechanisms by which Meth can induce and modulate free radical production, causing an aggravation on the severity of damage associated with virus presence in the brain tissue, and consequently aggravate AIDS-associated CNS dysfunctions. The results obtained in this proposal will allow the generation of data on direct effects of the drug on cells, relative susceptibility of different cell types to direct actions, and on pathways, aiming a future R01 application on modulation of oxidative stress in Meth abuse in vivo. These will lead to the development of important therapeutic tools for rehabilitating individuals, especially patients presenting co-morbid factors, such as HIV infection."

The imaging core was rated outstanding in our first submission and has added significantly to its resources, including microCT capabilities. The expansion of the Research Base has greatly increased the need for histology of soft and mineralized tissues and for in situ hybridization. The histology core would meet this need with high throughput, reproducible methods, particularly for tissue arrays, tissue sections and highly sensitive, non-radioactive in situ hybridization. Dr. Cavanagh has established a robotics system that, with our existing materials testing capabilities, forms the biomechanics core, adding a new and exciting dimension to investigations in the Research Base.

The expansion of the Research Base has greatly increased the need for histology of soft and mineralized tissues and for in situ hybridization. The histology core would meet this need with high throughput, reproducible methods, particularly for tissue arrays, tissue sections and highly sensitive, non-radioactive in situ hybridization. Dr. Cavanagh has established a robotics system that, with our existing materials testing capabilities, forms the biomechanics core, adding a new and exciting dimension to investigations in the Research Base. An External Advisory Board of 5 outstanding musculoskeletal researchers has been assembled to review the Pilot and Feasibility Projects and for evaluating their progress on a yearly basis. Their stringent review of the 6 Projects prepared from the 13 originally proposed has led to the 2 that are incorporated into this application. In sum, we feel that we have all the necessary attributes to provide a highly competitive application for a MCC that would enhance our research in ways that can make a difference and contribute more significantly to musculoskeletal research."
CCF Musculoskeletal Core Center,Unavailable,6751360,"HASCALL, VINCENT C.",VINCENT C..HASCALL@clevelandclinicfoundation,biomechanics;laboratory mouse;musculoskeletal system,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cleveland Clinic Foundation Musculoskeletal Core Center (CCFMCC). In the years since the original RFA for MCCs, musculoskeletal research activities have dramatically increased at CCF by the recruitment of Dr. Joseph Lannotti (an outstanding clinical musculoskeletal researcher) to the Chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, by the recruitment of Dr. Peter Cavanagh (an outstanding musculoskeletal biomechanics researcher) to the Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, by the creation of the Orthopaedic Research Center in these two Departments, and by the recruitment of 3 new investigators into the Center. This, combined with an already strong musculoskeletal program, now provides a broadly based, interactive and well-funded Research Base for our proposed CCFMCC. Investigators in the Research Base currently are PIs on 14 NIH R01 grants, 9 of them funded by NIAMS. This clearly demonstrates the commitment of the CCF and NIH to this research. The ORC is committed to collaboration in translational research and enrichment programs. An example is the monthly Musculoskeletal Research Seminar Series that extends to Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals Research Institute and NE Ohio Universities College of Medicine to generate synergistic research in the wider NE Ohio area. We ask, in this proposal, for funds to invite 4 national/international musculoskeletal researchers a year to enrich this already established activity.

CCF SCIENCE EDUCATION INITIATIVE,Unavailable,6188475,"DAVIS, BRIAN L",BRIAN L.DAVIS@clevelandclinicfoundation,education evaluation /planning; educationally disadvantaged; health science research support; science education; secondary schools; teacher,"The proposed CCF Science Education Initiative Program is designed to improve the quality of pre-college science education and to increase the pool of disadvantaged students interested and prepared to enter college and pursue a career in biomedical/behavioral sciences. Objectives are as follows: 1. To increase the opportunities for under disadvantaged students and teachers (of same) to gain access and hands-on exposure to the broad spectrum of discoveries in a biomedical research environment. 2. To increase the opportunities for research scientists to influence the content of science education in Cleveland Public Schools, including such challenging endeavors as classroom teaching and demonstrations, professional (teacher) development committee work, science fair judging, or the collaborative development of innovative teaching techniques. 3. To increase the opportunities for all stakeholders (students, parents, teachers and employers) to participate in collaborative learning forums designed to enhance understanding of race, class and gender barriers, as well as critical skills and current scientific research issues. Each forum will be developed with specific learning objectives in mind, using pre- test and post-test assignments. The core components of the program are: 1. An individually constructed, hands-on summer research experience for students and teachers in a CCF laboratory, under the mentorship of a research scientist. 2. Educational enrichment activities for teachers and students scheduled weekly throughout the summer session and quarterly through the academic school year. This program will provide an opportunity for Cleveland Clinic Foundation research scientists and clinicians to share their work and to play a significant role in the development and implementation of science education in the community. The Cleveland Clinic has the resources and commitment to accomplish these goals."
