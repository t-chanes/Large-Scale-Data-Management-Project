The Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Cirrhosis and Atrial Fibrillation,Unavailable,10559071,"SIMON, TRACEY ",TRACEY.SIMON@brighamandwomen'shospital,Address;Adult;Adverse event;Affect;Algorithms;Anticoagulants;Anticoagulation;Ascites,"ABSTRACT The prevalence of and mortality from cirrhosis have increased dramatically over the past twenty years. Atrial fibrillation (NVAF) disproportionately affects 15% of patients with cirrhosis and leads to substantial morbidity and mortality, including 5-fold higher rates of stroke. In the general population with NVAF, the risk-benefit balance typically favors initiation of oral anticoagulants (OAC). In contrast, over 50% of patients with cirrhosis and NVAF are not anticoagulated despite their markedly increased risk of stroke, due to concerns about bleeding, poor anticoagulation quality and falls. These concerns also complicate selection of an optimal OAC regimen, which involves choosing between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC: apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran and edoxaban). While DOACs have potential benefits over warfarin in patients with cirrhosis, they have variable hepatic metabolism (between 20%-75%) and they are largely untested in cirrhosis, because such patients were excluded from all prior DOAC randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for NVAF. Moreover, RCTs are unlikely to recruit and retain vulnerable patients with advanced, decompensated cirrhosis or cognitive impairments in a manner representative of routine care. Thus, for patients with cirrhosis and NVAF – who are at higher risk of both bleeding and thrombosis – there is a pressing need for robust data regarding the optimal OAC strategy. This proposal seeks to define the comparative effectiveness and safety of warfarin and DOACs in a population- based cohort of over 250,000 U.S. adults with established cirrhosis and NVAF diagnosed between 2011-2019 (including over 100,000 new OAC initiators), from 4 healthcare databases (Medicare, Medicaid, Truven MarketScan and Optum Clinformatics). Within this cohort, we propose: (Aim 1) To define the effectiveness and safety of use vs. non-use of OACs (including warfarin and specific DOACs); (Aim 2) To define the comparative effectiveness and safety of initiating (2a) warfarin vs. DOACs; and (2b) specific DOACs (i.e. head-to-head comparisons of, apixaban vs. rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran vs. edoxaban); and (Aim 3) To identify key subgroups for whom OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous – including patients with advanced or decompensated cirrhosis, high fall risk or poor predicted anticoagulation quality. To minimize confounding and optimize study validity, we will use innovative methods developed by our team, including: (i) high-dimensional propensity scores; (ii) our novel, validated algorithms for phenotyping cirrhosis severity, fall risk and anticoagulation quality; and (iii) linkage of a subset of our cohort with rich clinical information and laboratory data from electronic health records (EHR), for external adjustment and propensity score calibration. Completing these studies will provide the necessary evidence base for providers to optimize OAC selection and stroke prevention in vulnerable patients with cirrhosis and NVAF, yielding an immediate and direct public health benefit. This work will also produce a readily generalizable infrastructure for robustly detecting drug effects in patients with chronic liver disease."
Shared Decision-Making to Reduce Racial Disparities in Oral Anticoagulation Use in Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,10471407,"JACKSON, LARRY R",LARRY R.JACKSON@dukeuniversity,Address;Adherence;Adoption;Anticoagulants;Anticoagulation;Arrhythmia;Atrial Fibrillation;Award,"Blacks with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) are less likely to receive oral anticoagulants (OAC) for stroke prevention compared with Whites. This is notable given that Blacks have a 3-fold greater risk of NVAF-related ischemic stroke compared to Whites. My long-term goal is to reduce racial disparities in arrhythmia (defined as an abnormal heart rhythm) care. My goal in applying for a Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Faculty Diversity in Biomedical Research is to acquire the research skills and hands-on experience necessary to become a productive, independent, clinician-scientist. My research focuses on addressing racial disparities in the use of OAC in patients with NVAF. Candidate and Mentors: I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Duke University’s School of Medicine where I practice as an cardiac electrophysiologist. My primary mentor, Dr. Kevin Thomas, has expertise in healthcare disparities, specifically the contributors to lower quality of health care delivery and outcomes among racial and ethnic minority populations. Research and Training: The goal of this research proposal is to develop a patient decision support tool aimed at facilitating shared decision making, improving decision quality, and increasing the uptake of OAC in Blacks with NVAF. Shared decision making, aided through the use of patient decision support tools, has been associated with improved outcomes including increased knowledge, less decisional conflict, and increased uptake of therapeutic interventions. Unfortunately, Blacks are more likely to experience non-participatory decision making than non-racial and ethnic minority populations. In this proposal, I will: 1) conduct interviews among Black and White patients with NVAF and clinicians to understand the barriers and facilitators toward participating in shared decision making regarding use of OACs; 2) develop and iteratively evaluate a patient decision support tool; and 3) conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a patient decision support tool to facilitate shared decision making. The training plan will prepare me for a career aimed at addressing racial disparities in arrhythmia care and will include education in 1) implementation science to promote the adoption of our patient decision support tool in clinical practice; 2) accruing skills in the design and testing of patient decision support tools; and 3) design of clinical trials to assess the efficacy of our intervention. This research will provide data to support a R01 proposal to test the efficacy of a patient decision support tool to improve shared decision making, decision quality, and potentially increase the use an adherence of OAC in Blacks in a multisite randomized clinical trial. Summary: The proposed research will lead to the development of a patient decision support tool intervention used to facilitate shared decision making in Blacks with NVAF, improve decision quality, and potentially increase the uptake of OAC in Blacks with NVAF. The K01 Diversity award will support my development into a leader in healthcare disparities research with the goal of promoting patient-centered care by empowering patients to make informed, values- based decisions needed to improve decision quality and potentially reduce racial disparities in arrhythmia care."

New Synthetic Strategies for Protein Engineering,CHEMISTRY,8008949,"FRANCIS, MATTHEW B",MATTHEW B.FRANCIS@universityofcaliforniaberkeley,Address;Affinity Chromatography;Alder plant;Alkenes;Alkynes;Arts;Buffers;Catalysis,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central focus of the research herein is the development of new, highly site-selective reactions that can expand and complement the current state of the art in protein modification. A multidisciplinary approach has been developed that combines protein expression, purification, and characterization with the physical organic chemistry and organic synthesis techniques required for new reaction development. In particular, the reactions under study are designed to be orthogonal to existing lysine- and cysteine-based strategies, and thus can be used in concert with these tried-and-true methods. By targeting underutilized functional groups and by enhancing reaction selectivity between similar functionality, it is also anticipated that many entirely new avenues for protein labeling, protein immobilization, and de novo protein synthesis will emerge from these studies. Specifically, two powerful new strategies will be developed for the facile modification of tyrosine residues on protein surfaces. The first uses diazonium-coupling reactions to activate tyrosine residues, followed by a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction for further conjugation. Start to finish, this procedure takes as little as three hours to carry out, and can be used to couple alkenes and alkynes to tyrosines with absolute selectivity. The second strategy is a new three-component Mannich-based coupling reaction that can modify tyrosine residues with exquisite selectivity and simultaneously install two new functional groups. This reaction will be explored for as a new strategy for protein ligation. Transition-metal catalyzed reactions will also be explored, as they offer many opportunities for highly selective reactions and the activation of currently unmodifiable functional groups. In particular, the development of a metal carbene-based strategy for disulfide bonds will be explored as a means to modify antibody fragments and N-terminal methionine residues."
Studies using purified acetylcholine receptors,NEUROSCIENCES,7985855,"LINDSTROM, JON MARTIN",JON MARTIN.LINDSTROM@universityofpennsylvania,Affect;Agonist;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Animals;Antigens;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Autoantibodies,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) exist in a variety of subtypes which play distinct roles in neuronal function in health and disease, and provide specific drug targets. AChRs are important in the pathological mechanisms of tobacco addiction and Parkinson's disease, and are potential drug targets in many diseases including Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and ADHD. It is important to investigate the synthesis and functional properties of subtypes of human AChRs expressed in simple model systems in order to help explain their roles in complex genetically manipulated rodent nervous systems (e.g. knock out and knock in mice), and in humans. It is also important to develop systems in which highly selective drugs can be detected and their effects characterized. AChRs are formed from five homologous subunits organized around a central cation channel. Most AChRs are heteromeric, with two ACh binding sites formed by subunit pairs (e.g. a4¿2) and a fifth ""accessory"" subunit (e.g. ¿2, ¿3,a4, or a5) combined to form different AChR stoichiometries (e.g. (a4¿2)2¿2 or (a4¿2) 2a4 or subtypes (e.g.(a4¿2) 2a5). Our studies have revealed that accessory subunits influence efficiency of assembly, cation selectivity, as well as sensitivities to activation, desensitization, and allosteric modulators. Thus, it is especially important to investigate the roles of accessory subunits. Properties of a2 subunits are little known, but need investigation because they are more prominent in primates than rodents. AChRs containing a6 and ¿3 subunits (among others, hence the designation a6* AChRs) are found almost exclusively in aminergic neuron endings where, for example, they modulate the release of dopamine. a6* AChRs are required for addiction to nicotine. They promote dopamine release from the same neurons that are lost in Parkinson's disease. They may also help mediate the neuroprotective effects of nicotine on these neurons, and may be important in ADHD and other diseases. a6 AChRs play an even larger role in dopamine release in primates than rodents. Thus, a6* AChRs offer excellent drug targets. Study of a6* AChR subtypes is important but difficult. Our preliminary results are encouraging. The use of linked subunits has allowed us to express a6* AChRs of defined subtypes, stoichiometries, and subunit orders. We have developed conditions for expressing a6* AChRs in transfected cell lines. Aim 1 is to characterize alternate stoichiometries (e.g. (a4¿2)2¿2 and (a4¿2)2 and alternate subtypes (e.g. (a4¿2)2a5) of cloned human a4* and a2* AChRs expressed in pure forms. Aim 2 is to efficiently express and functionally characterize cloned human a6* AChR subtypes. mAbs to the defined conformation dependent epitopes on the extracellular surface of a2, a6, ¿3 and other subunits will be developed using novel AChR subunit/ACh binding protein chimeras as immunogens and will be used to study synthesis of these AChRs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nicotine acts through nicotinic receptors to cause addiction to tobacco, which results in more than 400,000 deaths/year in the United States. These receptors are found in the brain, peripheral nervous system and many non-neuronal tissues. Drugs directed at these receptors will help to reduce addiction to tobacco and may help treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as many other neuronal and non-neuronal diseases. We have made a unique and growing collection of cell lines which express specific receptor subtypes. We also have a unique and growing library of monoclonal antibodies to the subunits of these receptors. Our studies will increase the understanding of how these receptors assemble and function normally and under the influence of nicotine and nicotinic drugs. The cell lines that we prepare can be used to detect and evaluate new drugs directed at these receptors."
CHIRAL CATALYSTS FOR ENANTIOSELECTIVE SYNTHESES,CHEMISTRY,7928258,"DOYLE, MICHAEL PATRICK","MICHAEL PATRICK.DOYLE@univofmaryland,collegepark",3-hydroxybutanal;Acetates;Acetone;Acidity;Acids;Age;Alcohols;Aldehydes,"The goal of this research program is the design and development of highly selective and efficient catalytic processes for the synthesis of biologically relevant compounds. Investigations will build upon our newest discoveries with unique catalytic uses of dirhodium carboxamidates. Breakthroughs in their applications for chemical oxidations and as chiral Lewis acids have demonstrated greatly enhanced versatility for these catalysts that will be further explored. The fixed stereodefined geometry of these catalysts provides access to highly enantioenriched products in metal carbene reactions of diazoacetates and, together with their low oxidation potentials, also provides capabilities for highly selective Lewis acid catalyzed reactions and efficient chemical oxidations. In all aims we seek high turnover numbers and high selectivities. In this funding period we will resolve limitations of chiral dirhodium carboxamidates for metal carbene transformations by novel processes for which preliminary results indicate that the aims will be achieved. We will develop diazo chemistry for catalytic stereoselective transformations to further enhance applicability of catalytic metal carbene chemistry in organic synthesis. New catalytic syntheses of multi-functional B-keto-a- diazoesters with subsequent catalytic metal carbene transformations provides highly efficient access to more complex carbon frameworks than previously possible through reactions with diazoacetates. We will use active Lewis acidic chiral dirhodium(ll,lll) carboxamidate catalysts to broaden the range of applicable carbon-carbon bond forming transformations. Reactivity and selectivity enhancement through chiral dirhodium(ll,lll) catalysts expands their utilization to Lewis acid catalyzed reactions for which chiral dirhodium(ll,ll) catalysts are ineffective, and initial focus will be given to those transformations for which preliminary results are most promising. We will develop and apply catalytic oxidative methodologies to compounds that are of biological significance. Newly discovered tert-butyl hydroperoxide oxidations catalyzed by dirhodium caprolactamate, based largely on its low oxidation potential and solubilities, offer a unique opportunity to develop a spectrum of oxidative transformations, compatible with water as a solvent, that are not easily achieved by other methods (especially allylic and benzylic oxidations). Applications encompass reactions with steroids, phenolic compounds, unsaturated fatty acids, amines, and other biologically relevant substrates."

A multidisciplinary approach has been developed that combines protein expression, purification, and characterization with the physical organic chemistry and organic synthesis techniques required for new reaction development. In particular, the reactions under study are designed to be orthogonal to existing lysine- and cysteine-based strategies, and thus can be used in concert with these tried-and-true methods. By targeting underutilized functional groups and by enhancing reaction selectivity between similar functionality, it is also anticipated that many entirely new avenues for protein labeling, protein immobilization, and de novo protein synthesis will emerge from these studies. Specifically, two powerful new strategies will be developed for the facile modification of tyrosine residues on protein surfaces. The first uses diazonium-coupling reactions to activate tyrosine residues, followed by a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction for further conjugation. Start to finish, this procedure takes as little as three hours to carry out, and can be used to couple alkenes and alkynes to tyrosines with absolute selectivity. The second strategy is a new three-component Mannich-based coupling reaction that can modify tyrosine residues with exquisite selectivity and simultaneously install two new functional groups. This reaction will be explored for as a new strategy for protein ligation. Transition-metal catalyzed reactions will also be explored, as they offer many opportunities for highly selective reactions and the activation of currently unmodifiable functional groups. In particular, the development of a metal carbene-based strategy for disulfide bonds will be explored as a means to modify antibody fragments and N-terminal methionine residues."

Amidoglycosylation Reactions of Glycal Metallanitrenes,CHEMISTRY,7252852,"ROJAS, CHRISTIAN M.",CHRISTIAN M..ROJAS@barnardcollege,Acids;Affect;Alkenes;Amino Sugars;Arts;Asthma;Aziridines;Biochemical,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research are the development, mechanistic description, and application of new methodology for the synthesis of 2-amino sugars, crucial molecular components and precursors in biological systems, including structural polymers, enzyme inhibitors, and cell-surface glycoproteins. The synthetic approach uses glycal 3-carbamates as starting materials and proceeds through a tandem alkene amidation-glycosylation sequence-amidoglycosylation-to introduce nitrogen at C2 of the sugar framework and to establish an anomeric linkage to a nucleophilic reaction partner, the glycosyl acceptor. Iodosobenzene carries out this overall oxidation, in a process best catalyzed by dirhodium(II) carboxylates and apparently involving a rhodium-complexed acyl nitrene intermediate. The amidation step is intramolecular, forging the C2-N bond on the more hindered glycal face, and, ideally, glycosylation should occur stereospecifically, anti to the newly incorporated nitrogen substituent. While certain glycal 3-carbamates react with efficiency and high anomeric stereoselectivity, other substrates with potentially high synthetic value provide substantial amounts of C3-oxidized dihydropyranone byproducts and low stereocontrol in the glycosylation step. Using the mechanistic hypotheses that (1) both amidoglycosylation and C3 oxidation occur via a common metallanitrene intermediate and (2) stereoselective glycosylation requires neighboring-group participation from the C2 nitrogen, probably by way of a glycosyl aziridine, this application outlines how controlling the conformation of the glycal 3-carbamate framework will enable both high chemo- and stereoselectivity in the amidoglycosylation reactions. Other proposed investigations will further illuminate mechanistic details of the reactions, providing crucial information for improving and increasing the utility and scope of amidoglycosylation for the preparation of amino sugars. With input from both the method development and mechanistic study components of the proposed project, this application outlines the completion of a synthesis of the disaccharide portion of the potent chitinase inhibitor allosamidin. Iterative application of the amidoglycosylation technology will enable streamlined preparation of an allosamidin disaccharide module readily amenable for analogue synthesis. To be conducted at Barnard College, an undergraduate liberal arts college for women, the project will provide students with numerous opportunities in organic chemical synthesis, helping to attract and propel them into careers in chemistry and other health-related professions. Because amino sugars are constituents of numerous biochemical systems and medicinally active compounds, improved methods for their synthesis can contribute to efforts aimed at understanding and treating human diseases. The proposed research will develop new ways of preparing 2-amino sugars with the precise control of reactivity and molecular geometry that is required for application to problems in bio- and medicinal chemistry. This methodology will be used to synthesize a key amino sugar segment of the molecule allosamidin, a substance that inhibits a class of enzymes known as chitinases and may provide a basis for the design of compounds for treating asthma."
