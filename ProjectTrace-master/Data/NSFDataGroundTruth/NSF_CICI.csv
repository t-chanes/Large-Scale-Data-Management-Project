Concrete, steel and timber are the backbones of physical infrastructure. High strength polymer composites have been used for aerospace structures for about five decades and their use in civil infrastructure spans about 20 years. To accelerate the adoption of polymer composites into infrastructure, the NSF I/UCRC Center of the Integration of Composites into Infrastructure (CICI) was established as a joint effort of West Virginia University (WVU), North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the University of Miami. Recently, NSF has awarded a travel grant to establish an additional CICI site at Nanjing University of Technology in China. The NSF I/UCRC program brings together universities, private companies and government agencies together to leverage the research dollars for all parties by engaging in highly cooperative research. CICI's work with civil infrastructure has a tremendous effect on daily life, thus the Nation as a whole benefits as composite and hybrid materials lead to infrastructure systems of higher safety, shorter construction times and longer life spans at a reduced overall cost and improved labor productivity with the creation of new and higher skilled job opportunities. Member companies and end users benefit from the interaction with others in their field including highly trained students, with over 100 students expected to pass through CICI in the next 5 years. CICI is prolific technology transfer machine, exceeding the output for most I/UCRCs through the publishing of journal articles and conference presentations to promote the scientific research and knowledge dissemination. <br/><br/>Broadly speaking, the technical focus of CICI can be broken into four different areas. Initially, fundamental research projects are undertaken to broaden the knowledge base on infrastructure composites. This includes lifecycle performance, aging studies, evaluation of bond strength within a composite and as a substrate, and many others. From this on-going research, products are being developed that can be mass-implemented in infrastructure markets, including innovative hollow core or basalt fiber FRP rebar, waterway products that are noncorrosive or fabric reinforced cementitious composites for masonry wall strengthening and many others. The implementation of these products is the next focus area and is primarily accomplished through the development of codes and specifications. CICI has worked on the ASCE LRFD pultruded GFRP composites code, ASTM specifications, ACI building design and construction codes, the International Code Council and IIFC. Finally, CICI has an evaluation component based on IAB member feedback to ensure the composites that are implemented in the field are performing as designed as a part of our long-term performance program. Thus, through research, development, implementation and evaluation, CICI is involved in all facets of composite product evolution."

Concrete, steel and timber are the backbones of physical infrastructure. High strength polymer composites have been used for aerospace structures for about five decades and their use in civil infrastructure spans about 20 years. To accelerate the adoption of polymer composites into infrastructure, the NSF I/UCRC Center of the Integration of Composites into Infrastructure (CICI) was established as a joint effort of West Virginia University (WVU), North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the University of Miami. Recently, NSF has awarded a travel grant to establish an additional CICI site at Nanjing University of Technology in China. The NSF I/UCRC program brings together universities, private companies and government agencies together to leverage the research dollars for all parties by engaging in highly cooperative research. CICI's work with civil infrastructure has a tremendous effect on daily life, thus the Nation as a whole benefits as composite and hybrid materials lead to infrastructure systems of higher safety, shorter construction times and longer life spans at a reduced overall cost and improved labor productivity with the creation of new and higher skilled job opportunities. Member companies and end users benefit from the interaction with others in their field including highly trained students, with over 100 students expected to pass through CICI in the next 5 years. CICI is prolific technology transfer machine, exceeding the output for most I/UCRCs through the publishing of journal articles and conference presentations to promote the scientific research and knowledge dissemination. <br/><br/>Broadly speaking, the technical focus of CICI can be broken into four different areas. Initially, fundamental research projects are undertaken to broaden the knowledge base on infrastructure composites. This includes lifecycle performance, aging studies, evaluation of bond strength within a composite and as a substrate, and many others. From this on-going research, products are being developed that can be mass-implemented in infrastructure markets, including innovative hollow core or basalt fiber FRP rebar, waterway products that are noncorrosive or fabric reinforced cementitious composites for masonry wall strengthening and many others. The implementation of these products is the next focus area and is primarily accomplished through the development of codes and specifications. CICI has worked on the ASCE LRFD pultruded GFRP composites code, ASTM specifications, ACI building design and construction codes, the International Code Council and IIFC. Finally, CICI has an evaluation component based on IAB member feedback to ensure the composites that are implemented in the field are performing as designed as a part of our long-term performance program. Thus, through research, development, implementation and evaluation, CICI is involved in all facets of composite product evolution."

However, data security, integrity and privacy are becoming major concerns for scientific researchers when they access data from the cloud to conduct experiments or analytics. In addition, data owners may not want to reveal their data to cloud service providers either because of the sensitivity of the data (e.g., medical records) or because of its value. Therefore, it is important to create cloud data integrity assurance and privacy protection solutions that help users fully embrace cloud services as well as protect cyberinfrastructure resources. With a cloud database, data owners can store large-scale datasets collected from various sources. Users can then launch queries retrieving the data records for conducting research and experiments. However, there are several possible threats to query result accuracy. For example, a cloud database could be compromised and the stored data could be tampered with. There could be a malfunction in the cloud server, so that the cloud database inadvertently returns incomplete query results. It is unlikely that the client would be aware of such incorrect or incomplete query results. Consequently, erroneous data could be employed in subsequent scientific experiments or analyses, which could lead to false results. Cloud database query integrity assurance is critical issue that underpins a secure and trustworthy end-to-end scientific workflow. <br/><br/>This work approaches these problems in a privacy-friendly manner, building on top of encrypted queries over encrypted data. This is key for achieving both data privacy and data integrity. Data provenance - the history of the data and how its been handled - is also an important aspect of scientific workflows. However, securing the provenance to provide integrity, privacy, and confidentiality guarantees is also challenging, making it hard for many scientific workflows to provide a verifiable provenance history of scientific data and query results. With clouds, providing such guarantees is difficult for both data and provenance. This project enables infrastructural support for secure collection, storage, transmission, and verification of provenance information for all data and results stored and computed in the cloud. The availability of such verifiable provenance offers benefits to scientific workflows, making the process more trustworthy via verifiable history and results.

Data consistency guarantees  that everyone gets the right answers about where, who, and what regardless of which ledger is read.  This software advances the security of computing systems by making data accountable, especially for online commerce and big data (""the cloud'').

The key outcome is a software prototype that implements the complete system and illustrates the ability to store, maintain, and update provenance information for real data. <br/><br/>A data provenance framework will be designed, prototyped, evaluated and then delivered as an Application Programmer Interface, software library, and distributed service. This work will produce a reusable distributed service architecture achieving scalability by using distributed services that maintain ledger information. The system leverages Bitcoin cryptocurrency by building on Bitcoin's block-chain architecture to maintain provenance metadata securely. It leverages existing tools for provenance data exploration and visualization.  Digital signatures from both the server/system as well as the user creates dual information about possession, while distributed ledgers remove control and maintenance of metadata from the user who creates it. The prototype enables research into long-term provenance creation, maintenance, and utilization for workflows in the area of cybersecurity as well  studies of how to integrate and secure provenance into existing file systems and network services.  Opt-in and passive (involuntary) provenance systems will be enabled using the API, library, and distributed ledgers prototyped, enabling data provenance for systems where needed, notably high assurance cloud computing and scientific workflow systems.

SDMZs are increasingly being implemented by research agencies, campuses and national labs. In order to improve the throughput of scientific research data, NSF has funded many Science DMZ implementations on campuses by upgrading research network connectivity and encouraging installation of a SDMZ. However, the SDMZ has characteristics that separate it as a unique ecosystem which cannot simply adopt existing enterprise and cloud based network security technologies and policies. This project designs and prototypes an integrated Software Defined Network (SDN) security framework for managing data-intensive science applications utilizing the Science DMZ (SDMZ) model. It offers one of the first demonstrations of how fine-grained security controls can co-exist within a high performance data-intensive network. This project produces significant advancements in the trustworthiness and reliability of large-scale data-intensive scientific research infrastructures.<br/><br/>This project evaluates the current state of the SDMZ security architecture, then identifies the current shortcomings in its existing security services. The new proposed framework: 1) defines fine-grained network flow controls using dynamically deployable security services that are migratable and science-application aware; 2) defines a new class of network privilege management policies that can revoke or divert flows that violate SDMZ policies or that differ from user-defined, application-specific usage expectations; 3) establishes high-performance virtual circuits that enable data intensive applications to register and fast-path their authenticated flows across the SDMZ. Furthermore, this project introduces a unified security policy engine to dramatically simplify the control of the above three services. The policy engine offers a valuable and user-friendly abstraction to meet the domain-specific needs of the SDMZ."

Such a set of information is referred to as provenance -- very much like the provenance of artistic artifacts. Managing provenance is technically complex; yet it is key for data-intensive research. This project makes important advances in this direction by developing software systems for securely managing provenance. <br/><br/>This project develops a provenance management system for cyberinfrastructure that includes different types of hosts, devices, and data management systems. The proof-of-concept system, referred to as Cyber-provenance Infrastructure for Sensor-based Data-Intensive Research (CY-DIR), will support scientists throughout the life-cycle of their sensor-based data collection processes, including the continuous monitoring of sensors to ensure that provenance is collected and recorded, and the traceable use and processing of the data across different data management systems. CY-DIR provides researchers with provenance and metadata about data being collected by sensors. Provenance security will be assured by the use of efficient encryption techniques for use in sensors, secure logging techniques, and secure processors.

One well-recognized method for strengthening the password security is Two-Factor Authentication (TFA), in which the password is complemented by an additional authentication factor such as a mobile phone or a dedicated token (e.g., a USB dongle). However, current TFA mechanisms do not offer sufficient security and usability. This project breaks new ground towards improving both of these aspects. It designs, implements and evaluates TFA schemes that not only protect against on-line guessing attacks, but also against off-line dictionary attacks in case of server or mobile device compromise. Moreover, the project aims to do so without degrading usability compared to password-only authentication. The creation of formal security models for TFA schemes allow for better understanding of TFA security in general. The resulting research prototypes will be of immense value in future research on building resilient and usable authentication services. The project integrates research into educational activities in the form of advanced curriculum development as well as high school and K-12 student mentoring in the area of Identity and Access Management.<br/><br/>The design of new TFA protocols offers security against on-line guessing and offline dictionary attacks. The project formally proves the security of these protocols in a strong security model for TFA protocols that is being introduced as an extension to well-established password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) models. The goal is to design the TFA protocols in a modular way, allowing for the use of independent device and server components, and enabling the use of the developed schemes with existing password protocols and without the need to modify the server software. Moreover, the research involves developing and testing TFA systems which will instantiate the proposed protocols.  The goal is a TFA systems design that utilizes automated and user-transparent data channel between the mobile device and the client, falling back to localized wireless radio communication only when such a channel is unavailable. Such construction would provide high usability since the user experience of the login process would be almost equivalent to password-only authentication. Finally, the project involves conducting rigorous usability studies in the lab environment and field settings to evaluate the performance, usability, and adoption potential of the proposed approaches."

Data generated from end-user devices has tremendous value to the research community. For example, mobile and Internet-of-Things devices can participate in large-scale Internet-based measurement or monitoring of patient's health conditions. While ground-breaking discovered may occur, malicious attacks or unintentional data leaks threaten the research data. Such a threat is hard to predict and difficult to recover from once it happens. Preventative and defensive measures should be taken where data is generated in order to protect private, valuable data from the attackers. Currently, there are efforts that try to regulate data management, for example, a research application might have a privacy policy that describes how the user data is being collected and protected. However, there is a disconnect between these documented policies and the implementations of a research project. In this project, the investigators propose to interpret the documented policies and enforce them in research projects, in order to protect the privacy of research data. This work can significantly reduce researchers' overhead in implementing policy-compliant code and reduce the complexity of protecting research datasets.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigators provide a solution that protects research data using policies mandated by different regulatory entities, such as an application store and an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract security and privacy requirements from unstructured regulatory documents and translates these requirements to code that can patch a program that does not comply with the policies. The solution covers the lifetime of research data protection, from data collection to data storage, and data processing. This research has two thrusts. First, the investigators will build novel NLP techniques to extract security and privacy policies from unstructured, sparsely-labeled documents such as IRB protocols, and privacy disclosure of research applications. Second, the investigators will enforce these extracted policies in code, through context-aware program analysis to discover inconsistencies between a researcher's implementation and the extracted policies, and instrument researcher?s code to enforce compliant program behavior. The results of this work will have a transformative impact on the development of the next generation research data protection techniques, and more defensive security and privacy practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, data security, integrity and privacy are becoming major concerns for scientific researchers when they access data from the cloud to conduct experiments or analytics. In addition, data owners may not want to reveal their data to cloud service providers either because of the sensitivity of the data (e.g., medical records) or because of its value. Therefore, it is important to create cloud data integrity assurance and privacy protection solutions that help users fully embrace cloud services as well as protect cyberinfrastructure resources. With a cloud database, data owners can store large&#8208;scale datasets collected from various sources. Users can then launch queries retrieving the data records for conducting research and experiments. However, there are several possible threats to query result accuracy. For example, a cloud database could be compromised and the stored data could be tampered with. There could be a malfunction in the cloud server, so that the cloud database inadvertently returns incomplete query results. It is unlikely that the client would be aware of such incorrect or incomplete query results. Consequently, erroneous data could be employed in subsequent scientific experiments or analyses, which could lead to false results. Cloud database query integrity assurance is critical issue that underpins a secure and trustworthy end&#8208;to&#8208;end scientific workflow. <br/><br/>This work approaches these problems in a privacy&#8208;friendly manner, building on top of encrypted queries over encrypted data. This is key for achieving both data privacy and data integrity. Data provenance - the history of the data and how its been handled - is also an important aspect of scientific workflows. However, securing the provenance to provide integrity, privacy, and confidentiality guarantees is also challenging, making it hard for many scientific workflows to provide a verifiable provenance history of scientific data and query results. With clouds, providing such guarantees is difficult for both data and provenance. This project enables infrastructural support for secure collection, storage, transmission, and verification of provenance information for all data and results stored and computed in the cloud. The availability of such verifiable provenance offers benefits to scientific workflows, making the process more trustworthy via verifiable history and results. The research team creates a query integrity assurance, data privacy protection, and verifiable provenance framework which provides an array of solutions for supporting secure cloud services. This project contributes to the cybersecurity research community by piloting novel cloud data security approaches that accomplish the following goals: (1) developing Voronoi diagram&#8208;based integrity assurance techniques, (2) designing cloud database data privacy protection methods, (3) modeling the trade off between query integrity assurance and query evaluation costs, (4) realizing secure cloud data provenance mechanisms, and (5) implementing a prototype system, where all the components are integrated for security and performance evaluation."

Like most computers, these instruments are vulnerable to network-based attacks, which risk compromising data and harming the instrument. When an instrument is compromised via a network attack, the science it supports grinds to a halt. To ensure that researchers can maintain the control and integrity of their instruments and data, this project develops a device that works with the instruments' on-board computers to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation of data.

The file transfer facility will transfer large data files over long distances, while maintaining reliable performance. This facility will also digitally sign files, so data integrity can be verified throughout the science workflow. In turn, the network performance monitor will interface with associated online systems, so performance bottlenecks can be easily identified.

In order to improve the throughput of scientific research data, NSF has funded many Science DMZ implementations on campuses by upgrading research network connectivity and encouraging installation of a SDMZ. However, the SDMZ has characteristics that separate it as a unique ecosystem which cannot simply adopt existing enterprise and cloud based network security technologies and policies.

Securing this complex and highly dynamic environment is extremely challenging, particularly since campus infrastructures are increasingly under attack from malicious actors on the Internet and (often unknowingly) internal campus devices. Different parts of the campus have very different policies and regulations that govern its treatment of sensitive data (e.g., private student/employee information, health care data, financial transactions, etc.). Furthermore, data-intensive scientific research traffic often requires exceptions to normal security policies, resulting in ad-hoc solutions that bypass standard operational procedures and leave both the scientific workflow and the campus as a whole vulnerable to attack. In short, state-of-the-art campus security operations still heavily rely on human domain experts to interpret high level policy documents, implement those policies through low-level mechanisms, create exceptions to accommodate scientific workflows, interpret reports and alerts, and be able to react to security events in near real time on a 24-by-7 basis.<br/><br/>This project addresses these challenges through a collaborative research effort, called NetSecOps (Network Security Operations), that assists information technology (IT) security teams by automating many of the operational tasks that are tedious, error-prone, and otherwise problematic in current campus networks. NetSecOps is policy-driven in that the framework encodes high-level human-readable policies into systematic policy specifications that drive the actual configuration and operation of the infrastructure. NetSecOps is knowledge-centric in that the framework captures data, information, and knowledge about the infrastructure in a central knowledge store that informs and guides IT operational tasks. The proposed NetSecOps architecture has the following unique capabilities: (1) the ability to capture campus network security policies systematically; (2) the ability to create new fine-grained network control abstractions that leverage existing security capabilities and emerging software defined networks (SDN) to implement security policies, including policies related to both scientific workflows and IT domains; (3) the ability to implement policy traceability tools that verify whether these network abstractions maintain the integrity of the high-level policies; (4) the ability to implement knowledge-discovery tools that enable reasoning across data from existing security point-solutions, including security monitoring tools and authentication and authorization frameworks; and (5) the ability to automatically adjust the network's security posture based on detected security events. Research results and tools from the project will be released into the public domain allowing academic institutions to utilize the resources as part of their best-practice IT security operations."

Despite these incentives, concerns such as respecting human subject and patient privacy, maintaining intellectual property, and compliance with copyright laws remain as barriers to sharing data with its detailed provenance. By simplifying the process of safely releasing provenance metadata, the project will facilitate the sharing of data with a concomitant benefit to science and medicine.<br/><br/>The project creates software to tightly couple data and its accompanying provenance metadata, and sanitize the resulting provenance when it is shared. A storage overlay is developed to perform partial computation over the data as it enters the system. This allows the application of pre-configured functions to incoming data without affecting extant workload performance, by leveraging idle processing resources. The paradigm facilitates efficient content-based provenance that describes the state of the data in the system. This allows references in the provenance metadata to be strongly linked to integrity claims about the specific data inputs and outputs, even when these correspond to large data sets. When such scientific and medical data sets are combined, new privacy-violating inferences may be drawn.<br/><br/>The project investigates techniques that operate on sets of provenance graphs, descriptions of unsafe inferences, and ontological or probabilistic characterizations of the relationships of provenance elements.

AMDN also includes Collective Anomaly Detection, in which intra- and inter-cloud networking alarms and anomalies indicative of attacks are combined and used for mission assurance strategies. The detected anomalies and alarms are correlated over the whole system in order to detect sophisticated attacks that might be undetectable at the single node level. The security of the entire system is flexible and programmable depending on the nature of collaborations, computing resources needed, and various requirements of scientists. In addition to scientific use, AMDN can be used for commercial applications such as financial data sharing among banks or health data sharing among hospitals and between critical infrastructures such as Smart Grids. Although AMDN is primarily designed for wide-area network usage, it can be used for services and clients residing inside a single cloud or data center."

Data consistency guarantees  that everyone gets the right answers about where, who, and what regardless of which ledger is read.  This software advances the security of computing systems by making data accountable, especially for online commerce and big data (""the cloud'').  It secures forensic information taken from compromised computers  for further analysis. It validates whether privacy requirements are being met for medical records.  The key outcome is a software prototype that implements the complete system and illustrates the ability to store, maintain, and update provenance information for real data. <br/><br/>A data provenance framework will be designed, prototyped, evaluated and then delivered as an Application Programmer Interface, software library, and distributed service. This work will produce a reusable distributed service architecture achieving scalability by using distributed services that maintain ledger information. The system leverages Bitcoin cryptocurrency by building on Bitcoin's block-chain architecture to maintain provenance metadata securely. It leverages existing tools for provenance data exploration and visualization.  Digital signatures from both the server/system as well as the user creates dual information about possession, while distributed ledgers remove control and maintenance of metadata from the user who creates it. The prototype enables research into long-term provenance creation, maintenance, and utilization for workflows in the area of cybersecurity as well  studies of how to integrate and secure provenance into existing file systems and network services.  Opt-in and passive (involuntary) provenance systems will be enabled using the API, library, and distributed ledgers prototyped, enabling data provenance for systems where needed, notably high assurance cloud computing and scientific workflow systems.

As data are being collected to tackle increasingly challenging scientific and medical problems, there is need to scale up the amount of expert human input (curation and, in certain cases, annotation) accordingly.  This project addresses this need by developing collaborative data curation:  instead of relying on a small number of experts, it enables annotations to be made by communities of users of varying expertise.  Since the quality of annotations by different users will vary, novel quantitative techniques are developed to assess the trustworthiness of each user, based on their actions, and to distinguish trustworthy experts from unskilled and malicious users. Algorithms are developed to combine users' annotations based on their trustworthiness.  Collaborative data curation will greatly increase the amount of human annotated data, which will, in turn, lead to better Big Data analysis and detection algorithms for the life sciences, medicine, and beyond.<br/><br/>The central problems of collaborative data curation lie in the high variability in the quality of users' annotations, and variability in the form the data takes when they annotate it.  The proposal develops techniques to take annotations made by different users over different views of data (such as an EEG display with filters and transformations applied to the signal), to use provenance to reason about how the annotations relate to the original data, and to reason about the reliability and trustworthiness of each user's annotations over this data.  To accomplish this, the research first defines data and provenance models that capture time- and space-varying data; novel reliability calculus algorithms for computing and dynamically updating the reliability and trustworthiness of individuals, based on their annotations and how these compare to annotations from recognized experts and the broader community; and a high-level language called PAL that enables the researchers to implement and compare multiple policies.  The researchers will initially develop and validate the techniques on neuroscience and time series data, within a 900+ user public data sharing portal (with 1500+ EEG and other datasets for which annotations are required). The project team later expands the techniques to other data modalities, such as imaging and genomics"

The security of these infrastructures is thus of crucial importance, as the vulnerabilities in their unique software stacks can cause significant damage to economy, environment, public health, and national security. This project aims to safeguard scientific computing infrastructures via automatically identifying hidden software vulnerabilities in a timely manner. Particularly, the goal of this project is to address the challenging problem of configuration-related security bugs in highly customizable high-performance computing environments. Detecting such vulnerabilities is a hard problem. The stateof- the-art general vulnerability analyzers are unable to capture the specific runtime contexts of multiple interdependent software elements in specialized scientific computing environments. To bridge this gap, this project connects advanced bug-finding techniques to dedicated high-performance computing settings. In addition, it also seeks to leverage the unique characteristics of scientific computing environments to facilitate vulnerability discovery. Hence, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of the software security problems in real-world scientific computing systems, and builds robust solutions to secure these systems.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project develops novel deployment-specific vulnerability detection techniques, that can (a) discover seemingly well-formed, yet inconsistent configuration values within scientific computing contexts, (b) detect cross-component vulnerabilities caused by the settings of interconnected computing software, and (c) take full advantage of the de facto workflow of high-performance computing systems to reduce the complexity of finding bugs. This research consists of three tasks: (1) it investigates the deployment contexts in real-world high-performance computing systems and develops both offline and online tools to automatically collect contextual information; (2) it applies extracted contexts to detecting misconfiguration and configuration-triggered code vulnerabilities at both deployment time and incrementally at runtime; (3) it tests the novel technique in real-world testbeds and scientific computing environments to evaluate its accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such individuals are in short supply and the demand is growing steadily. This new workforce should be trained in realistic and adaptable environments within the context of existing policies and technologies. Furthermore, due to the complexity of the problem, it is imperative that the individuals are well versed in a broad spectrum of related subjects, which means, ideally, trained at an academic institution where they can find instruction in a variety of areas of study. The researchers plan to address this critical shortage of both the people and the skills needed to meet demand by creating an educational program in cybersecurity, supported by a highly effective, flexible platform designed to deploy real-world training scenarios while integrating cybereducation resources available at multiple prominent national sites. Skills acquired in this program are applicable far beyond academic or research settings, and the developed technology will serve as a universal template for cybersecurity training. The most important component of the program is the human element - the students, the future cybersecurity experts. The project creates a foundation for consolidating Cybersecurity into an attractive field of study that leads to highly sought-after qualifications and thus opens a path to long-term, rewarding careers.<br/><br/>In collaboration with the Michigan Cyber Range (MCR) facility operated by Merit Network, and the Cyber Academy operated by the College of Professional Studies (CPS) at the George Washington University, the project proposes to establish and deploy an open and flexible technology platform for broad-context cybersecurity education and hands-on training. Initially, the platform will be used in developing and delivering a credit bearing Practicum (2 credit hours) that addresses Intrusion Detection and Remediation. The course will be transferable toward the undergraduate certificate in Protection and Defense of Computer Networks, which is part of the Bachelor's degree completion in cybersecurity. The practicum is a hands-on training that will cover a broad range of network intrusion, prevention, and detection techniques such as implementation and testing of IDS security plans, security monitoring, intrusion detection, alarm management, analysis of events and trends, and vulnerability management. The program utilizes a high-performance, flexible environment built on Cisco's UCS hardware platform with a modified OpenStack framework. This multi-tenant system, originally developed under an NSF grant, facilitates the full integration of the Cyber Academy with the MCR resources. Thanks to its virtual nature and its tight coupling with physical cyberinfrastructure components such as HPC, cluster storage arrays, public and private clouds, 100G optical networks, and a wide variety of SDN technologies, the system is able to deploy nearly any cybersecurity scenario, on demand."

However, the Internet is vulnerable to congestion and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which can cause devastating losses of research resources and results, disrupting scientific collaboration, as well as to other services. The goal of this project is to develop and deploy defenses to facilitate robust and secure Internet communication for scientific collaboration. The developed defenses will address two major connectivity concerns: minimizing congestion by mitigating amplification DoS attacks, and preventing route hijacking, that is, circumventing devastating attacks on inter-domain routing that can prevent communication between remote sites. Throughout this research, the PIs work closely with the network operators of the University of Connecticut, the Connecticut Educational Network, and other Research and Education networks. The project generates tested tools, protocols and free open- source software, which can be directly integrated into operational networks. The protection mechanisms developed in this project significantly benefits the scientific community and the society in general.<br/><br/>This project addresses two of the biggest, long-standing challenges to Internet Infrastructure robustness and security. Firstly, the project develops new defenses against amplification bandwidth-DoS attacks; these attacks and subsequent tools are particularly relevant to university networks. These defenses combine the emerging Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) standard, with an improved Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) technique, to effectively filter spoofed packets received from peers. Secondly, the project develops, implements and deploys an improved RPKI validator for secure inter-domain routing. This validator addresses deployment concerns and challenges, in particular concerns about false positives, and provides additional security and functionality improvements to facilitate wide deployment.  Amongst RPKI's benefits, correct deployment of RPKI prevents route hijacking, which is the most common type of attacks on Internet inter-domain routing. Route hijacking may be abused in many ways, including eavesdropping, spoofing and preventing communication between remote sites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Securing this complex and highly dynamic environment is extremely challenging, particularly since campus infrastructures are increasingly under attack from malicious actors on the Internet and (often unknowingly) internal campus devices. Different parts of the campus have very different policies and regulations that govern its treatment of sensitive data (e.g., private student/employee information, health care data, financial transactions, etc.). Furthermore, data-intensive scientific research traffic often requires exceptions to normal security policies, resulting in ad-hoc solutions that bypass standard operational procedures and leave both the scientific workflow and the campus as a whole vulnerable to attack. In short, state-of-the-art campus security operations still heavily rely on human domain experts to interpret high level policy documents, implement those policies through low-level mechanisms, create exceptions to accommodate scientific workflows, interpret reports and alerts, and be able to react to security events in near real time on a 24-by-7 basis.<br/><br/>This project addresses these challenges through a collaborative research effort, called NetSecOps (Network Security Operations), that assists information technology (IT) security teams by automating many of the operational tasks that are tedious, error-prone, and otherwise problematic in current campus networks. NetSecOps is policy-driven in that the framework encodes high-level human-readable policies into systematic policy specifications that drive the actual configuration and operation of the infrastructure. NetSecOps is knowledge-centric in that the framework captures data, information, and knowledge about the infrastructure in a central knowledge store that informs and guides IT operational tasks. The proposed NetSecOps architecture has the following unique capabilities: (1) the ability to capture campus network security policies systematically; (2) the ability to create new fine-grained network control abstractions that leverage existing security capabilities and emerging software defined networks (SDN) to implement security policies, including policies related to both scientific workflows and IT domains; (3) the ability to implement policy traceability tools that verify whether these network abstractions maintain the integrity of the high-level policies; (4) the ability to implement knowledge-discovery tools that enable reasoning across data from existing security point-solutions, including security monitoring tools and authentication and authorization frameworks; and (5) the ability to automatically adjust the network?s security posture based on detected security events. Research results and tools from the project will be released into the public domain allowing academic institutions to utilize the resources as part of their best-practice IT security operations."

Problems with security credentials (e.g., expiration, privilege mismatch) cause the workflows to fail to fetch needed input data or store valuable scientific results, distracting scientists from their research by requiring them to diagnose the problems, re-run their computations, and wait longer for their results. In an effort to avoid these problems, scientists often use long-lived, highly-privileged credentials (e.g., enabling the workflow to fully impersonate their identity), increasing risks to their accounts and to the underlying computational infrastructure and resulting in complexity for information security officers managing the infrastructure. The SciTokens project delivers open source software to help scientists manage their security credentials more reliably and securely. The project includes participants from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project to ensure relevance and facilitate adoption. Integration with the widely-used HTCondor software and collaboration with Open Science Grid and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) facilitates adoption by the wider scientific community.<br/><br/>To address the challenges and risks of managing security credentials for scientific workflows, the SciTokens project delivers an open source software infrastructure that uses IETF-standard Open Authorization (OAuth) tokens for capability-based secure access to remote scientific data. SciTokens uses OAuth refresh tokens, maintained securely on the submission node, to delegate short-lived, least-privilege OAuth access tokens to scientific workflows, to enable their remote data access. The access tokens convey the specific authorizations needed by the workflows, rather than general-purpose authentication impersonation credentials. These least-privilege authorization tokens help to address the risks of scientific workflows running on distributed infrastructure including NSF resources (e.g., LIGO Data Grid, Open Science Grid, XSEDE) and public clouds (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure). By improving the interoperability and security of scientific workflows, the SciTokens project 1) enables use of distributed computing for scientific domains that require greater data protection and 2) enables use of more widely distributed computing resources by reducing the risk of credential abuse on remote systems."

This is because certain restrictions on data usage (e.g., maintaining appropriate audit logs for the data modifications) must be enforced rigorously, which is difficult to accomplish with existing technologies in a seamless manner.  The need to share scientific data while honoring usage restrictions, protecting data integrity, and capturing provenance for scientific repeatability requires development of new software tools that can support these capabilities across multiple organizations? boundaries. The novel blockchain based data sharing system built as a part of this project may result in advancing the knowledge base on how to automatically balance the conflicting goals of security and integrity requirements and information sharing in the context of open scientific discovery process. This system in return can significantly increase volume and variety of data shared for research purposes across a broad range of disciplines, thereby directly addressing the NSF Big Idea on Harnessing the Data Revolution, by further advancing capabilities of modern cyberinfrastructure and fostering novel opportunities for interdisciplinary data-intensive research. Furthermore, by actively incorporating our research results into the curriculum development, at both undergraduate and graduate levels, we foster the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists in a new era for open data.<br/><br/>To achieve the above stated goals, this project builds an innovative system where blockchain techniques are leveraged for assured scientific data sharing. First, the project develops a policy specification framework tailored for open science data sharing. Using this framework, scientists may easily specify any usage restriction (e.g., do not  re-identify  human  subjects,  do  not  modify  data,  notify  us  if  the  data  is  lost due  to  hacking).  Later on, using the blockchain framework, these restrictions will be captured,  and stored via smart contracts.  One novel aspect of the proposed framework is that, using machine learning techniques, it can analyze the smart contract based provenance information to automatically detect potentially anomalous data modifications. To test the capabilities of our framework,  the project uses a multi-sensor based data collection and data sharing project for understanding the impact of urban pollution as a case study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These attacks threaten the privacy, integrity, and ability to access valuable scientific data and events. The risks to scientific facilities and how they can be attacked have still not been properly mapped. This project will use novel Artificial Intelligence to (1) study hackers in the international and ever-evolving Dark Web and identify and categorize hundreds of thousands of risks and (2) link those risks to possible attacks on two large-scale science community facilities. One of them is a facility funded by the National Science Foundation offering advanced computing resources for Life Sciences. The other uses a network of sensors around the globe to collect detailed and timely data for Earth Sciences. Studying these valuable targets enables investigation of current and emerging threats that present risk to scientific discovery.<br/><br/>Led by the Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) University of Arizona (UA), this project designs an innovative, holistic, and proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) framework with two synergistic research streams. The first builds upon advanced topic modelling and text classification approaches from our NSF Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) research to systematically collect and explore multi-million record Dark Web hacker forums for scientific cyberinfrastructure exploits. The second designs novel banner data feature extraction, text analytics, and custom vulnerability scanning integrating state-of-the-art tools to comprehensively categorize and assess the vulnerabilities within CyVerse?s (life sciences) and LEO?s (earth sciences) diverse instruments, data, hardware, and software.

For instance, the privacy of clinical trial subjects, the integrity of medical data, and the safety of tissue samples and cultures can be compromised if the cyberinfrastructure of a university hospital is breached. Information Security Officers (ISOs) are in charge of maintaining a secure cyberinfrastructure for research, but their task is complicated by the speed at which new threats emerge, and by the proliferation of software (often written in different languages) and obsolete or specialized hardware among labs and research centers. ISOs look for answers in their quest to fight intrusions and vulnerabilities in documentation and on-line discussion forums, but this is a time-consuming process. To streamline the process, an interdisciplinary team of researchers are developing a computer system to automatically and continuously harvest all that knowledge from online sources, organizing it into a network of concepts and relations that can be queried and reasoned upon to keep ISOs a step ahead of malicious attacks. <br/><br/>The project develops a number of interconnected modules: 1) A sub-system that identifies concepts and relations in software documentation, advisory bulletins, and on-line technical forums, and then retrieves that information using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques; 2) An ontology for cybersecurity, which is a knowledge representation system that organizes the retrieved concepts and relations into a logical network, allowing for implicit knowledge to be extracted by means of automatic reasoning algorithms, and;  3) A querying interface, which allows ISO staff to access the knowledge represented in the ontology to find answers to their questions about cybersecurity. This innovative approach to cybersecurity extends the use of ontologies in the biomedical field, leveraging the metaphor of vulnerabilities in information systems as viruses or infections. Even though the initial stages in the creation of the ontology will involve curation by human experts, the researchers expect that the system can itself automatically thanks to the use of information retrieval techniques, therefore overcoming one of the known bottlenecks in the usefulness of ontologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such policy-driven approach would help achieve important challenges in scientific collaborations: fairness in resource sharing and risk management in dealing with digital assets. However, such AM-Policies have been specified, evaluated and enforced in an ad-hoc, semi-formal, and incomplete way: (i) scientists still need to write their own AM-Policies without having expressiveness power in policy specification, making it difficult for them to correctly articulate their specific needs.

These data include genetic and chemical biomarkers of identity, ethnicity, behavior, consumption, pollution, and pathogenic infections. Interest in WBE exploded recently, as researchers turned to wastewater samples to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection levels in local populations and inform public health responses to the pandemic. Because data collected from wastewater are aggregated at the population level, they are typically assumed to be anonymous, and are therefore not subject to health privacy or other regulatory protections. These data are most useful when shared, yet sharing raises security and privacy issues, for individuals as well as neighborhoods, schools and governments.  The project is developing technology and tools to support legitimate uses of WBE datasets while minimizing abuse, and it is designing protocols for protecting individual and organizational privacy.  These tools will encourage wide participation in WBE consortia by enabling organizations to protect their data from adverse uses, which in turn will help improve the health of the general public and reduce morbidity and mortality.<br/><br/>The project addresses three key security threats: those posed by individual queries; those posed by sharing, whether through joint queries or large-scale association studies; and those posed by the presence of human genetic material in wastewater samples.

The project leaders have built long term partnerships with local IT and cybersecurity-related organizations and consortia, which enable the project to reach beyond academia and affect the cybersecurity of the general public. Finding qualified cybersecurity personnel is a challenge faced by campuses and businesses across the nation.  One major goal of the CORE center is development of the cybersecurity workforce in New England.  The project directly addresses this need, providing a template for other regions to follow. The project offers internships, assistantships, and co-ops for students to work in the security operations and research center and obtain hands-on training in cybersecurity operation and research. The researchers incorporate the outcomes of the project into courses on computer and network security and privacy, mobile computing, wireless networks and digital forensics. They have a track record of accepting female and minority students into research groups, and consciously and actively encourage students from traditionally underrepresented groups to join this project.<br/><br/>The researchers have established an open cybersecurity program at UMass, which guides customers through a sequence of steps and selects security controls and technologies from both proprietary solutions and free open source solutions, considering the budget of the institution or enterprise that wants to protect their assets. In the UMass cybersecurity program, these assets go through the UMass controls ""factory"". The input of the factory is unmanaged assets with weak security controls or without any controls. The output is a suite of managed assets with strong security controls, thus ensuring campus environments have robust cybersecurity protection. The researchers have applied the UMass open cybersecurity program to the UMass network and assets, which are monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This project expands the services including security consulting, security operations and security training/education to other local institutions and companies, and performs research on emerging threats, trends and defense based on the collected data. To sustain the operation, the CORE center provides services at affordable rates."

These adversities affect many lives; for example, during the past decade alone, unprecedented flooding, catastrophic hurricanes, and devastating wildfires destroyed thousands of homes, vital infrastructure, and communities. Citizens often struggle to cope with these adversities due to the trauma experienced during these events as well as the extensive recovery stress. The Human Resilience research community conducts scientific studies to (i) understand how citizens suffer from these adversities and (ii) seek effective solutions to help citizens recover or bounce back from the stress and trauma caused by these adversities. The importance of Human Resilience research can hardly be overstated because of the large population of citizens affected. Despite this clear importance, the scientific discovery process of Human Resilience research is hindered by the lack of cyberinfrastructure support for secure, privacy-preserving, and policy-complying data sharing that would foster collaborative research. This calls for solutions to modernizing and accelerating the scientific discovery process of Human Resilience research.<br/><br/>This project investigates a competent technical solution to modernizing and accelerating the scientific discovery process of Human Resilience research, by tackling a range of technical challenges including: (i) specifying the requirements of a competent cyberinfrastructure; (ii) defining a solution framework to adequately address these requirements; (iii) designing a comprehensive system architecture to fulfill the framework; (iv) investigating novel mechanisms and supporting techniques; and (v) developing a prototype system and demonstrating its usefulness.

It has been observed that sometimes during this complex process, scientific data is unintentionally modified or accidentally tampered with, with errors going undetected and corrupt data becoming part of the scientific record. The IRIS project tackles the problem of detecting and diagnosing these unintentional data errors that might occur during the scientific processing workflow. The approach is to collect data relevant to the correctness and integrity of the scientific data from various parts of the computing and network system involved in the processing, and to analyze the collected data using machine learning techniques to uncover errors in the scientific data processing. The solutions are integrated into Pegasus, a popular ""workflow management system"" - a software used to describe the complex process in a user-friendly way and that handles the details of processing for the scientists. The research methods will be validated on national computing resources with exemplar scientific applications from gravitational-wave physics, earthquake science, and bioinformatics. These solutions will allow scientists, and our society, to be more confident of scientific findings based on collected data.<br/><br/>Data-driven science workflows often suffer from unintentional data integrity errors when executing on distributed national cyberinfrastructure (CI). However, today, there is a lack of tools that can collect and analyze integrity-relevant data from workflows and thus, many of these errors go undetected jeopardizing the validity of scientific results. The goal of the IRIS project is to automatically detect, diagnose, and pinpoint the source of unintentional integrity anomalies in scientific workflows executing on distributed CI. The approach is to develop an appropriate threat model and incorporate it in an integrity analysis framework that collects workflow and infrastructure data and uses machine learning (ML) algorithms to perform the needed analysis. The framework is powered by novel ML-based methods developed through experimentation in a controlled testbed and validated in and made broadly available on NSF production CI. The solutions will be integrated into the Pegasus workflow management system, which is used by a wide variety of scientific domains. An important part of the project is the engagement with science application partners in gravitational-wave physics, earthquake science, and bioinformatics to deploy the analysis framework for their workflows, and to iteratively fine tune the threat models, ML model training, and ML model validation in a feedback loop.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing cybersecurity problems can adversely impact scientific research and its economic and social benefits if the cyberinfrastructure that supports scientific research and education is not well protected. Beyond the implementation of innovative cybersecurity solutions, it is critical to establish structured and effective practices and better collaboration among various stakeholders to share cybersecurity resources, expertise and information. This project focuses on establishing a regional collaboration and partnership within the state of Pennsylvania, referred to as SAC-PA. SAC-PA provides critical support to smaller academic institutions, including resource constrained regional institutions that serve under-represented populations as well as high school teachers and students. It establishes a collaboration and partnership framework to enable concerted activities promoting the use of effective cybersecurity techniques and practices inherent in security-assured cyberinfrastructure. While enhancing the cybersecurity posture of Pennsylvania, SAC-PA provides a regional cybersecurity collaboration and partnership model that can be adopted by other regions, or be extended to national-level collaborations.<br/> <br/>The SAC-PA project includes participation from both the public and private sectors and academic institutions in PA. The following key activities are planned: (i) developing and delivering three regional workshops in Pittsburgh to bring together regional stakeholders from scientific research communities along with cyberinfrastructure or cybersecurity resources to better understand the regional capabilities; explore existing and emerging cybersecurity challenges/solutions; and devise collaboration and partnerships to enable concerted cybersecurity activities to promote the use of effective cybersecurity techniques and practices; (ii) collaboratively developing training/awareness materials based on the needs and capabilities identified in the workshops, and sharing these extensively with regional partners and beyond through various channels; and (iii) establishing regional partnerships and a shared repository of cybersecurity resources/capabilities to facilitate collaborative and concerted efforts towards protecting scientific cyberinfrastructure. The project leverages capabilities of LERSAIS, an NSA/DHS designated Center of Academic Excellence and Research (CAE/CAE-R), University of Pittsburgh faculty members, University of Pittsburgh?s Computing Services and Systems Department, local partners with an excellent track record of collaboration in cybersecurity capacity building, education and research projects, and the established NSF CyberCorp program at the University of Pittsburgh. <br/>"

Department of Energy (DOE) researchers have coined the term ""superfacility"" to describe an integration of two or more existing facilities using high-performance networks and data management software in order to increase scientific output.  Currently, superfacilities are purpose-built manually for a specific scientific application or community, limiting their use to large projects that are long-lived.  Recent advances in campus science networks (Science DMZs) and federated Infrastructure-as-a-Service, as in NSF GENI, provide the basic building blocks to enable construction of dynamic superfacilities on demand. Automating the creation of superfacilities reduces their cost but introduces new security challenges. By design, their dynamic network links bypass campus security appliances in order to maintain a friction-free network path; security for these paths is typically addressed by managing interconnections manually.   This project creates a framework to automate, authorize, and monitor end-to-end connectivity across dynamic superfacilities, bringing this technology to a wider range of scientists.<br/><br/>The SAFE Superfacilities project brings together researchers and IT support organizations from RENCI/UNC Chapel Hill, Duke University and DOE/ESnet.  The goal of this project is to generalize support for stitching dynamic network circuits by providing the authorization and security monitoring necessary to enable general, dynamic, and safe interconnections as a foundational building block for Science DMZ, Software Defined Exchanges (SDX), and superfacilities.  One element of the project focuses on using the SAFE logical trust system to authorize dynamic stitching of network links in two systems developed, deployed, and operated by the researchers and their collaborators: the ExoGENI testbed and Duke's Software-Defined Science Network (SDSN) campus network exchange.   A second element addresses dynamic out-of-band security monitoring of traffic over these links.  The project serves as a model for improving security while maintaining high-performance friction-free network paths between campus scientists and remote facilities."

The integrity of the data generated and stored on computer clusters is of undisputed importance to scientific research and business intelligence, as compromised data can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions. Unfortunately, existing security mechanisms for high-performance and distributed computing systems are complex, inconsistent, insecure, and difficult to deploy. Many systems utilizing the current security mechanisms simply do not provide sufficient protection and remain vulnerable to even trivial attacks. For example, recent studies have found that thousands of unprotected database installations and computer clusters have been hacked. As such, there is a pressing need to improve the security of high-performance and distributed computing systems. <br/><br/>This project develops a security framework for high-performance and distributed computing systems that employs strong modern cryptographic algorithms, and is easy to reason, deploy, and use without lengthy and error-prone configurations.  The project consists of three major components: a container-based virtual cluster, a component to defend against side-channel attacks, and a secure execution ledger for auditing. The first component is the key to enabling authentication, authorization, and data protection for clusters without sacrificing usability or performance. The project team will build the virtual cluster based on the popular Docker container but enhance it with flexible key management, attack surface reduction, and security hardening, including defenses against side-channel attacks. Communications among nodes of a virtual cluster and I/O operations are transparently encrypted to protect the data in transition and at rest. The secure execution ledger provides a global holistic view of program execution in the whole system, allowing auditing the behavior of individual users as well as user groups. By tightly integrating these three components, the project seeks to achieve strong support for the four pillars of the cluster data security ? authentication, authorization, auditing, and data protection."

This effort focuses on technological solutions to address such sensitive data's security and privacy risks. The specific type of solution approach chosen is based on a class of techniques known as encrypted data querying. These methods involve a particular type of encryption that allows the (cloud) servers to answer queries asked by clients while keeping the data encrypted. Compared to other approaches, these solutions have lower overheads but a higher risk of information leakage to the server. Both the solutions and their limitations depend upon the nature of the data and the queries, and previous work has not explicitly focused on complex scientific data and associated queries. With this observation, this effort aims to establish encrypted data querying as an attractive method for protecting sensitive scientific data on clouds. A highly interdisciplinary team with expertise in system security, cryptography, scientific data management, and data science workflows supports the agenda of this work.<br/><br/>With distinct characteristics of science data and typical queries on them, the current state-of-the-art in encrypted data querying needs to be extended in terms of the methods themselves, the design of leakage attacks, and the understanding of leakage risks. The research thrusts include: 1) New Encryption and Query Processing Techniques, where challenges with several types of queries that include equality-based selection, multi-dimensional range selection, and joining on value similarity or ranges are addressed. 2) Scale and Efficiency Oriented Designs, which includes novel representation that supports joins and encryption, and how parallelism in scientific data processing can be combined with encryption. 3) Evaluating Overheads and Leakage in Science Contexts, where the overheads and leakage are studied using several real cases.  In the process, the recent literature on leakage attacks is being extended to work with science cases and the methods being developed.  In terms of broader impact, the resulting work will directly result in higher security of sensitive science data in the cloud and on organizational servers. This effort also involves many contributions to curriculum and human resource development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some parties may demand confidential processing of their sensitive assets to protect intellectual property, embargo data (or algorithm) sharing before publishing a paper, conform to legal requirements, or avoid the responsibility for releasing sensitive data. However, integrating confidential computing into scientific workflows raises significant challenges. (1) Most science domain developers find it challenging to learn specific confidential computing frameworks and secure their code to protect from side-channel attacks. (2) The interplay between the private components and other components in a collaborative workflow may enable new attacks and side channels for adversaries to explore. The proposed project aims to address these challenges with a scientist-friendly development framework for confidential computing and a holistic attack study and mitigation framework for collaborative workflows. The success of this project will enable domain scientist developers to adopt the best confidential computing practices easily and use publicly available resources without the concern of confidentiality and privacy breach, boosting the idea of open, collaborative science.<br/><br/>Specifically, the proposed research focuses on the scientist-oriented trusted-execution-environment (TEE) based development and studies its integration with collaborative scientific workflows.

Beyond providing researchers customized, secure packages of widely used open software, the Helix++ project will provide insights and directions for future research and strategies for protecting critical cyber infrastructure. Using two existing operational open-science platforms at the University of Virginia, the project will investigate the interaction of technical and policy issues which are fundamental to infrastructure protection.<br/><br/>The open-source Helix++ project improves the security posture of open science platforms by applying cutting-edge cybersecurity techniques to diversify and harden software automatically. A distinguishing feature of Helix++ is that it does not require source code or build artifacts. It operates directly on software in binary form?even stripped executables and libraries. This feature is key as rebuilding applications from source is a time-consuming and often frustrating process. Helix++ enables the rapid generation and deployment of secure containers and virtual machines, wherein various applications and libraries are transformed to incorporate the Helix++ protections. Diversification breaks the software monoculture and makes attacks harder to execute as information needed for a successful attack will have changed unpredictably. Diversification also forces attackers to customize an attack for each target instead of attackers crafting an exploit that works reliably on all similarly configured targets. Hardening directly targets key attack classes. The combination of diversity and hardening provides defense-in-depth, as well as a moving target defense.

Furthermore, tightly synchronized clocks between the base stations of mobile phone and data networks enable mobile handsets to share limited radio spectrum more efficiently. In fact, many modern critical infrastructures including computer networks, communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks rely on precise time and time synchronization for efficient and safe operations. However, existing commonly used time synchronization approaches, including both GPS and the Network Time Protocol (NTP), are extremely vulnerable to attacks. As modern research cyberinfrastructure quickly evolves towards a distributed architecture with the incorporation of cloud computing resources and new forms of sensing and computing infrastructures, and as attacks on the time infrastructure have increased, developing secure time synchronization approaches for resilient time service is of paramount importance.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to provide novel and holistic approaches to enable time security for cyberinfrastructures that employ the two most commonly used time synchronization mechanisms, i.e., GPS based and NTP based synchronization. More specifically, the project seeks to provide a security solution as a national service for all civil GPS time users. It will also develop and prototype a redundancy based security solution to NTP synchronization with minimal extra communication overhead. The main thrusts are to: i) establish a reference GPS receiver and server at Clemson University that can be used for GPS receivers across the US to detect spoofing attacks by cross checking encrypted military code in GPS signals; ii) develop a pulse based redundant synchronization approach to verify the reliability of network time provided by NTP; iii) experimentally prototype the two secure time approaches on a flood monitoring platform and a weather station platform, and use them to secure Clemson's campus NTP timing network in collaboration with the Information Technology (IT) department."

This project will design and prototype the architecture of the Assured Mission Delivery Network (AMDN), which will enable collaboration among scientific communities involving multiple independent organizations with varying levels of trust.  <br/><br/>They novelty of AMDN lies in the notion of network-level Mission Assurance Services (MAS); these services allows mission directors to specify actions to be taken by the network to deal with attacks and anomalies and to quickly reconfigure the network to best assure the successful completion of the mission. Security is the key part of the AMDN design, and addresses essential functionality such as authentication, integrity, accountability and privacy. AMDN also includes Collective Anomaly Detection, in which intra- and inter-cloud networking alarms and anomalies indicative of attacks are combined and used for mission assurance strategies. The detected anomalies and alarms are correlated over the whole system in order to detect sophisticated attacks that might be undetectable at the single node level. The security of the entire system is flexible and programmable depending on the nature of collaborations, computing resources needed, and various requirements of scientists. In addition to scientific use, AMDN can be used for commercial applications such as financial data sharing among banks or health data sharing among hospitals and between critical infrastructures such as Smart Grids.

One popular workflow management system is Pegasus, which, over the past three years, was used to run over 700,000 workflows by scientists in a number of domains including astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, gravitational wave physics, ocean science, and neuroscience. The ""Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus"" project enhances Pegasus with additional security features. The scientist's description of their desired work is protected from tampering and the data processed by Pegasus is checked to ensure it hasn't been accidentally or maliciously modified. Such tamper protection is attained by cryptographic techniques that ensure data integrity. These changes allow scientists, and our society, to be more confident of scientific findings based on collected data.<br/><br/>The Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus project strengthens cybersecurity controls in the Pegasus Workflow Management System in order to provide assurances with respect to the integrity of computational scientific methods. These strengthened controls enhance both Pegasus' handling of science data and its orchestration of software-defined networks and infrastructure. The result is increased trust in computational science and increased assurance in our ability to reproduce the science by allowing scientists to validate that data has not been changed since a workflow completed and that the results from multiple workflows are consistent. The focus on Pegasus is due to its popularity in the scientific community as a method of computation and data management automation. For example, LIGO, the NSF-funded gravitational-wave physics project, recently used the Pegasus Workflow Management System to structure and execute the analyses that confirmed and quantified its historic detection of a gravitational wave, confirming the prediction made by Einstein 100 years ago. The proposed project has established collaborations with LIGO and additional key NSF infrastructure providers and science projects to ensure broadly applied results."

A Science DMZ is a portion of the network, built at or near the edge of the campus or laboratory's network, that is designed such that the equipment, configuration, and security policies are optimized for high-performance scientific applications rather than for general-purpose computing. This project develops a secure and resilient architecture called SciGuard that addresses the security challenges and the inherent weaknesses in Science DMZs. SciGuard is based on two emerging networking paradigms, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), both of which enable the granularity, flexibility and elasticity needed to secure Science DMZs. <br/><br/>Two core security functions, an SDN firewall application and a virtual Intrusion Detection System (IDS), coexist in SciGuard for protecting Science DMZs. The SDN firewall application is a software-based, in-line security function running atop the SDN controller. It can scale well without bypassing the firewall using per-flow/per-connection network traffic processing.  It is also separated from the institutional hardware-based firewalls to enforce tailored security policies for the science-only traffic sent to Science DMZs. The virtual IDS is an NFV-based, passive security function, which can be quickly instantiated and elastically scaled to deal with attack traffic variations in Science DMZs, while significantly reducing both equipment and operational costs. In addition to these functions, the researchers also design a cloud-based federation mechanism for SciGuard to support security policy automatic testing and security intelligence sharing. The new mechanisms developed in this project are robust, scalable, low cost, easily managed, and optimally provisioned, therefore substantially enhancing the security of Science DMZs. This research encourages the diversity of students involved in the project by active recruitment of women and other underrepresented groups for participation in the project. The project has substantial involvement of graduate students in research, and trains promising undergraduate students in the implementation and experiments of the proposed approach.

The SDMZ is a portion of the network, built at the campus or laboratory's edge, that is designed such that the equipment, configuration, and security policies are optimized for high-performance scientific applications rather than for general-purpose business systems or enterprise computing. SDMZs are increasingly being implemented by research agencies, campuses and national labs. In order to improve the throughput of scientific research data, NSF has funded many Science DMZ implementations on campuses by upgrading research network connectivity and encouraging installation of a SDMZ. However, the SDMZ has characteristics that separate it as a unique ecosystem which cannot simply adopt existing enterprise and cloud based network security technologies and policies. This project designs and prototypes an integrated Software Defined Network (SDN) security framework for managing data-intensive science applications utilizing the Science DMZ (SDMZ) model. It offers one of the first demonstrations of how fine-grained security controls can co-exist within a high performance data-intensive network. This project produces significant advancements in the trustworthiness and reliability of large-scale data-intensive scientific research infrastructures.<br/><br/>This project evaluates the current state of the SDMZ security architecture, then identifies the current shortcomings in its existing security services. The new proposed framework: 1) defines fine-grained network flow controls using dynamically deployable security services that are migratable and science-application aware; 2) defines a new class of network privilege management policies that can revoke or divert flows that violate SDMZ policies or that differ from user-defined, application-specific usage expectations; 3) establishes high-performance virtual circuits that enable data intensive applications to register and fast-path their authenticated flows across the SDMZ. Furthermore, this project introduces a unified security policy engine to dramatically simplify the control of the above three services. The policy engine offers a valuable and user-friendly abstraction to meet the domain-specific needs of the SDMZ."

This process can be tedious and error-prone, which has led to the development of software known as a ""workflow management system"". Workflow management systems allow scientists to describe their process in a human-friendly way and then the software handles the details of the processing for the scientists, dealing with tedious and repetitive steps and handling errors. One popular workflow management system is Pegasus, which, over the past three years, was used to run over 700,000 workflows by scientists in a number of domains including astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, gravitational wave physics, ocean science, and neuroscience. The ""Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus"" project enhances Pegasus with additional security features. The scientist's description of their desired work is protected from tampering and the data processed by Pegasus is checked to ensure it hasn't been accidentally or maliciously modified. Such tamper protection is attained by cryptographic techniques that ensure data integrity. These changes allow scientists, and our society, to be more confident of scientific findings based on collected data.<br/><br/>The Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus project strengthens cybersecurity controls in the Pegasus Workflow Management System in order to provide assurances with respect to the integrity of computational scientific methods. These strengthened controls enhance both Pegasus' handling of science data and its orchestration of software-defined networks and infrastructure. The result is increased trust in computational science and increased assurance in our ability to reproduce the science by allowing scientists to validate that data has not been changed since a workflow completed and that the results from multiple workflows are consistent. The focus on Pegasus is due to its popularity in the scientific community as a method of computation and data management automation. For example, LIGO, the NSF-funded gravitational-wave physics project, recently used the Pegasus Workflow Management System to structure and execute the analyses that confirmed and quantified its historic detection of a gravitational wave, confirming the prediction made by Einstein 100 years ago. The proposed project has established collaborations with LIGO and additional key NSF infrastructure providers and science projects to ensure broadly applied results."

Department of Energy (DOE) researchers have coined the term ""superfacility"" to describe an integration of two or more existing facilities using high-performance networks and data management software in order to increase scientific output.  Currently, superfacilities are purpose-built manually for a specific scientific application or community, limiting their use to large projects that are long-lived.  Recent advances in campus science networks (Science DMZs) and federated Infrastructure-as-a-Service, as in NSF GENI, provide the basic building blocks to enable construction of dynamic superfacilities on demand. Automating the creation of superfacilities reduces their cost but introduces new security challenges. By design, their dynamic network links bypass campus security appliances in order to maintain a friction-free network path; security for these paths is typically addressed by managing interconnections manually.   This project creates a framework to automate, authorize, and monitor end-to-end connectivity across dynamic superfacilities, bringing this technology to a wider range of scientists.<br/><br/>The SAFE Superfacilities project brings together researchers and IT support organizations from RENCI/UNC Chapel Hill, Duke University and DOE/ESnet.  The goal of this project is to generalize support for stitching dynamic network circuits by providing the authorization and security monitoring necessary to enable general, dynamic, and safe interconnections as a foundational building block for Science DMZ, Software Defined Exchanges (SDX), and superfacilities.  One element of the project focuses on using the SAFE logical trust system to authorize dynamic stitching of network links in two systems developed, deployed, and operated by the researchers and their collaborators: the ExoGENI testbed and Duke's Software-Defined Science Network (SDSN) campus network exchange.   A second element addresses dynamic out-of-band security monitoring of traffic over these links.  The project serves as a model for improving security while maintaining high-performance friction-free network paths between campus scientists and remote facilities."

Moving this data through ordinary networks is very slow, in part because the amount of data is more than ordinary networks are designed to handle, and in part because of the checking that network security mechanisms perform. The ""science DMZ"" (DeMilitarized Zone) is a special network designed to move massive amounts of data very quickly. The need to do so results in compromises affecting security; checking is done on entry, and only for the first part of the connection. If the connection is suspicious, it is blocked; otherwise, it is allowed through. This project extends the checking by sampling the data in the connection throughout the lifetime of the connection. Then, if something suspicious is detected in the samples, appropriate action can be taken. A second goal of this project is to determine what procedural or technical actions are most effective when malicious flows are detected. The final goal is to determine how to speed up the security analysis so the impact on the throughput is both minimal and acceptable. The overall goal is to secure the science DMZ network without sacrificing speed.<br/><br/>More specifically, on a science DMZ, large amounts of data are moved, making it very difficult to secure, so data is sampled only when a connection starts and is analyzed without blocking the connection. If the analysis shows it is malicious, a filter rule is added to the router to drop packets in that connection. This project samples not just at the beginning, but at various times while the connection is active. If something malicious starts during the connection, it can be detected. What to do when suspicious flows are identified is less clear; the project will examine both technical and procedural methods, for example slowing down the flow to where it can be analyzed thoroughly, and then if indeed malicious, provide information to the Chief Information Security Officer?s (CISO) office to enable them to take action. If the flow is not malicious (i.e., a false positive, confirmed by the more detailed analysis), the rate reduction will cease. A key question is how to reduce the time needed for the sampling analysis. Part of this project is to examine how to speed up intrusion detection systems by using GPUs in order to do a quicker analysis."

Such collections are made possible by advances in computer technology such as sensors which collect data such as humidity, air quality and so forth, and powerful computer systems that analyze the data. The increased use of data for scientific research poses some important challenges. Data can have errors which impact conclusions derived from the data. Scientific research has to be reproducible to support validation and detection of scientific misconduct. Addressing these challenges requires tracking data used in research projects. Examples include: tracking the source that originated the data ? for example a mobile phone that acquired some images- and its geographic location; tracking which computer systems processed the data; tracking how scientists modified given data. Such a set of information is referred to as provenance ? very much like the provenance of artistic artifacts. Managing provenance is technically complex; yet it is key for data-intensive research. This project makes important advances in this direction by developing software systems for securely managing provenance. <br/><br/>This project develops a provenance management system for cyberinfrastructure that includes different types of hosts, devices, and data management systems. The proof-of-concept system, referred to as Cyber-provenance Infrastructure for Sensor-based Data-Intensive Research (CY-DIR), will support scientists throughout the life-cycle of their sensor-based data collection processes, including the continuous monitoring of sensors to ensure that provenance is collected and recorded, and the traceable use and processing of the data across different data management systems. CY-DIR provides researchers with provenance and metadata about data being collected by sensors. Provenance security will be assured by the use of efficient encryption techniques for use in sensors, secure logging techniques, and secure processors. Research from this project will provide novel results in several areas: provenance techniques for sensor data; cryptographic key management for sensors, mobile devices, and unmanned aircraft systems; provenance aware streaming data processing techniques; protection of provenance data against tempering; provenance data integration across different data management systems."

The underlying network plays a crucial role in supporting these needs in that it must provide assurance about the security of data and collaborative activities. This project addresses such requirement by designing and developing a network architecture to securely share data among groups of scientists. A community of scientists sharing a common interest and supporting resources is called a mission. This project will design and prototype the architecture of the Assured Mission Delivery Network (AMDN), which will enable collaboration among scientific communities involving multiple independent organizations with varying levels of trust.  <br/><br/>They novelty of AMDN lies in the notion of network-level Mission Assurance Services (MAS); these services allows mission directors to specify actions to be taken by the network to deal with attacks and anomalies and to quickly reconfigure the network to best assure the successful completion of the mission. Security is the key part of the AMDN design, and addresses essential functionality such as authentication, integrity, accountability and privacy. AMDN also includes Collective Anomaly Detection, in which intra- and inter-cloud networking alarms and anomalies indicative of attacks are combined and used for mission assurance strategies. The detected anomalies and alarms are correlated over the whole system in order to detect sophisticated attacks that might be undetectable at the single node level. The security of the entire system is flexible and programmable depending on the nature of collaborations, computing resources needed, and various requirements of scientists. In addition to scientific use, AMDN can be used for commercial applications such as financial data sharing among banks or health data sharing among hospitals and between critical infrastructures such as Smart Grids. Although AMDN is primarily designed for wide-area network usage, it can be used for services and clients residing inside a single cloud or data center."

But not all data have equal quality, fidelity, and value. The data may originate from a poor quality camera. The high quality sensor data may be maliciously altered during its transfer over a network with low security. This project develops a framework to calculate integral data quality and security (DQS) indicators and provide them to the user along with data itself.

The framework includes generic data structures and algorithms implementing a DQS evaluation. While the developed evaluation techniques cover a wide range of data sources, from cloud based data systems to embedded sensors, the framework's implementation concentrates on using an ordinary user's Android smartphone. The developed methodologies will be verified by their implementation on the eNeighborhoodWatch platform, an application that not only enables interaction between users and government but also, with the user's permission, perform data collection for scientific studies (e.g. noise pollution, earthquake prediction), facilitating collaboration between thousands of ordinary users with the research community."

One well-recognized method for strengthening the password security is Two-Factor Authentication (TFA), in which the password is complemented by an additional authentication factor such as a mobile phone or a dedicated token (e.g., a USB dongle). However, current TFA mechanisms do not offer sufficient security and usability. This project breaks new ground towards improving both of these aspects. It designs, implements and evaluates TFA schemes that not only protect against on-line guessing attacks, but also against off-line dictionary attacks in case of server or mobile device compromise. Moreover, the project aims to do so without degrading usability compared to password-only authentication. The creation of formal security models for TFA schemes allow for better understanding of TFA security in general. The resulting research prototypes will be of immense value in future research on building resilient and usable authentication services. The project integrates research into educational activities in the form of advanced curriculum development as well as high school and K-12 student mentoring in the area of Identity and Access Management.<br/><br/>The design of new TFA protocols offers security against on-line guessing and offline dictionary attacks. The project formally proves the security of these protocols in a strong security model for TFA protocols that is being introduced as an extension to well-established password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) models. The goal is to design the TFA protocols in a modular way, allowing for the use of independent device and server components, and enabling the use of the developed schemes with existing password protocols and without the need to modify the server software. Moreover, the research involves developing and testing TFA systems which will instantiate the proposed protocols.  The goal is a TFA systems design that utilizes automated and user-transparent data channel between the mobile device and the client, falling back to localized wireless radio communication only when such a channel is unavailable. Such construction would provide high usability since the user experience of the login process would be almost equivalent to password-only authentication. Finally, the project involves conducting rigorous usability studies in the lab environment and field settings to evaluate the performance, usability, and adoption potential of the proposed approaches."

The Department of Defense modified the DFARS clause to mandate that NIST 800-171 be followed for data classified and marked as CUI in 2017. The next evolution of this program is called Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification CMMC. Other agencies, for example, Department of Education, have indicated that they are considering following a similar path to safeguard data. While these requirements improve the consistency of data handling between agencies and contractors and grantees, it leaves academic institutions to figure out how to meet such requirements in a cost-effective way that fits the research and education mission of the institution. Most institutions, agencies, and companies act in isolation with one-off contract language to address data security and safeguarding concerns. The Regulated Research Community of Practice (RRCoP) builds a network of people able to help each other in implementing an affordable but effective cybersecurity and compliance program at academic institutions. Even though cybersecurity has a clear and uniform goal of protecting data, a onesize solution does not fit all academic institutions.<br/><br/>Through this project, RRCoP accomplishes 1) Developing cybersecurity training resources that share validated and diverse best-practices. 2) Establishing a leadership training and development program accelerating availability of distributed university resources 3) Developing representation through strategic partnerships with industry and government entities. By supporting this community with development of a community strategic roadmap, regular discussions and workshops, and a repository of generalized and specific resources for handling regulated research programs RRCoP lowers the barrier to entry for institutions handling new regulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Attacks have significant effects on social media, content and many other Internet services. Malicious actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are employing methods to hide their attack origins, amplify the size of their attacks, and use huge botnets that simply overwhelm their targets. This project directly addresses these advanced attacks by developing and deploying a defense in depth approach, called Deep Layers, to mitigate the types of DDoS attacks seen most recently. Deep Layers will be deployed to protect B-Root, the critical infrastructure that is one of thirteen providers of the Domain Name System (DNS) service for the top level (root) of Internet names that begin with www.<br/><br/>The Deep Layers solution to DDoS attacks integrates two approaches to filter spoofed traffic, two approaches to identify known-good traffic (hop-count filtering and prioritization of known-good clients), with the addition of a cloud-based scaling component to handle the largest attacks. The combination of these steps address an array of increasingly sophisticated attacks, ranging from those seen today to those that would be possible in the future, significantly increasing DNS resilience to DDoS attacks. The project integrates and extends several recent successful research approaches to DDoS defense and demonstrates their effectiveness on the B-root critical infrastructure. The project demonstrates Deep layers on the B-Root DNS server, and makes it available to other DNS operations as open source software. The work vastly improves the reliability of the DNS critical infrastructure, benefiting all Internet users."

Although there are long-term interests in sharing security related information, it places organizations at risk regarding the protection of their data and exposure of other vulnerabilities. This project designs, develops and implements a CYBersecurity information EXchange with Privacy (CYBEX-P) platform using trusted computing paradigms and privacy-preserving information sharing mechanisms for cybersecurity enhancement and development of a robust cyberinfrastructure. The outcome of this project has a broader impact on the development of a novel cybersecurity information-sharing platform with privacy preservation and a robust governance structure. The project also has direct impact on undergraduate and graduate student education and training, emphasizing the engineering development of minorities and women, by providing a real-world platform for investigation and management of cyber threats.<br/><br/>Envisioning that effective and privacy-preserving threat intelligence sharing can be instrumental for auditing the state of the threat landscape and helping to predict and prevent major cyber-attacks, this project provides a service for structured information exchange. The CYBEX-P platform provides valuable measurable information about the security status of systems and devices together with data about incidents stemming from cyber-attacks. To develop and implement such an environment across statewide organizations, then across the nation, this research project incorporates blind processing, privacy preservation and integrity of shared incident data by ensuring that only trusted processes access the raw data and only anonymized data are shared with other operators. Blind processing enables the advantages of additional information exchange while respecting organizational constraints and trust boundaries. This research also establishes a flexible governance framework that includes both policies and procedures to protect the data and provide all customers with the tools to demonstrate they are complying with both regulatory and internal data governance requirements. Specifically, the outcomes of the project demonstrate: i) CYBEX-P infrastructure development with affordable scalability, secure data exchange, and analytic components, ii) Privacy-preserving information sharing via blind processing and anonymization, and an iii) CYBEX-P governance framework."

This process can be tedious and error-prone, which has led to the development of software known as a ""workflow management system"". Workflow management systems allow scientists to describe their process in a human-friendly way and then the software handles the details of the processing for the scientists, dealing with tedious and repetitive steps and handling errors. One popular workflow management system is Pegasus, which, over the past three years, was used to run over 700,000 workflows by scientists in a number of domains including astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, gravitational wave physics, ocean science, and neuroscience. The ""Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus"" project enhances Pegasus with additional security features. The scientist's description of their desired work is protected from tampering and the data processed by Pegasus is checked to ensure it hasn't been accidentally or maliciously modified. Such tamper protection is attained by cryptographic techniques that ensure data integrity. These changes allow scientists, and our society, to be more confident of scientific findings based on collected data.<br/><br/>The Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus project strengthens cybersecurity controls in the Pegasus Workflow Management System in order to provide assurances with respect to the integrity of computational scientific methods. These strengthened controls enhance both Pegasus' handling of science data and its orchestration of software-defined networks and infrastructure. The result is increased trust in computational science and increased assurance in our ability to reproduce the science by allowing scientists to validate that data has not been changed since a workflow completed and that the results from multiple workflows are consistent. The focus on Pegasus is due to its popularity in the scientific community as a method of computation and data management automation. For example, LIGO, the NSF-funded gravitational-wave physics project, recently used the Pegasus Workflow Management System to structure and execute the analyses that confirmed and quantified its historic detection of a gravitational wave, confirming the prediction made by Einstein 100 years ago. The proposed project has established collaborations with LIGO and additional key NSF infrastructure providers and science projects to ensure broadly applied results."

TTP remains a strategic objective of Agencies which fund cybersecurity research, including NSF. However, the NSF cybersecurity portfolio contains only a small amount of security research that has been transitioned into operational activities. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) of the White House defines transition to practice as research that ""creates measurable improvements in the cybersecurity landscape"". Although NSF encourages security researchers with promising applied research projects to submit TTP (Transition to Practice) projects, a very low percentage of researchers take advantage of this opportunity. This EAGER will serve as an outreach vehicle to cybersecurity Principal Investigators (PIs), informing them of the advantages of engaging in a TTP and instructing them on the differences between a traditional research proposal and a TTP-focused one. The PI's will conduct workshops at three PI meetings for NSF programs - Cybersecurity Innovation for Cyberinfrastructure (CICI), Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) and Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) as well as at several academic conferences, including USENIX Security and Security and Privacy (S&P) among others.<br/><br/>In 2015, NSF sponsored two workshops which brought together key stakeholders to provide insights on how to improve the TTP process and encourage more TTP submissions. An important outcome of that workshop was the identification of specific barriers to TTP. In order to keep momentum going from these workshops, this follow-on project identifies specific ways in which PI's can overcome these barriers as they consider how to address TTP. The project establishes workshops for PI's to write more focused proposals, and provides opportunities for the PI's to engage with the NSF-funded cybersecurity community to foster more transition of cybersecurity research into the hands of the operational Information Technology Community. The expected outcome is that NSF expands the impact of the cybersecurity research it funds by producing more TTP results in the near to mid-term in order to make cyberspace safer."

These researchers will travel twice to the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica de Yucatan (CICY) in Merida, Mexico. The purpose of the visits is to conduct preliminary experiments and to prepare research proposals for study of composite materials composed of polymers containing single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) that provide a sensing capability through their piezoresistivity. Such materials may find use as indicators of deformation and damage in civil structures as well as in automobiles and aircraft. The two planning visits to Merida are scheduled for the summers of 2010 and 2011 to investigate PET-CNT nanocomposite films and vinyl ester-CNT composites.  Their Mexican collaborators will similarly travel to Virginia Tech with CONACyT funding to pursue the joint research activities.<br/><br/>This planning visit aims to advance a collaboration in the study of polymer-CNT nanocomposites, their synthesis and processing, and their ability to serve as sensors of structural deterioration and damage. This is a current topic of interest in the application of nanotechnology and is intellectually both challenging and rewarding. The work should reveal interesting macroscopic electro-mechanical effects and how they depend on the microscale composition and structure.  While promoting international research collaboration among the participants, this project will enable the two graduate students from Virginia Tech to establish professional relationships with their Mexican peers. Success in the development of effective and inexpensive materials and devices for monitoring structural health could have significant benefits by preventing catastrophic failures."

The study area is ideal to implement the proposed bottom-up approach study barriers to the diffusion and adoption of 'indigenous"" technologies since: it is especially prone to the effects and escalating risk of natural hazards (e.g., high winds) and global climate change; local collaborating materials scientists have studied and prototyped two candidate building materials to be evaluated, one for new construction (wood-plastic composites) and one for retrofit/repair (low-cost cement-polymer mortar); and, local stakeholders have yet to embrace innovations. The project will investigate barriers to the diffusion and adoption of building technologies through the lens of recent conceptual and analytical social science perspectives, including social network analysis and science, and technology and society (STS) studies. Historically, the strongest technological, cultural and aspirational connections have run from the Global South to the Global North. Recently, transportation and communication innovations have made South-South interaction more viable and vibrant. Social science research, however, has not assessed the impact of more intense, multi-scalar South-South networks on the diffusion and adoption of new building technologies. By testing the proposed research hypothesis, new knowledge will be created to understand how to integrate social considerations influencing technology diffusion and adoption into the process of conceiving, researching and developing new building technologies, and shepherding them from the laboratory to the field. The project will provide opportunities for a diverse team of researchers (1 minority, 2 women, and 2 early-career) and students to participate in substantive international research. With respect to societal benefits, research will contribute to the mitigation of the impacts of disasters in the study area, with potential application to coastal regions of the US and elsewhere. The project will also promote bottom-up collaboration as an alternative means of improving quality of life and represents the first building block for a transnational network for the dissemination of knowledge in coastal regions of the Global South. This award is co-funded by the Global Venture Fund (GVF) of NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) and the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program."
