Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven malignancy that is endemic to East and
Southeast Asia. The overall 5-year survival rate for endemic NPC is only 51%, which represents an unmet clinical
need. While NPC tumors are known to be infected with EBV and express PD-L1, little is known about the role of
EBV-specific T cells in the control of NPC and anti-PD-1 therapy has shown a low rate of efficacy (ORR ~20%).
The goal of this study is to better understand the role of EBV-specific T cell responses in NPC immunopathology
and immunotherapeutic response. We will test the specific hypotheses that: 1. EBV-specific T cells contribute to
tumor control elicited by combination anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, and 2.
that the phenotypic and clonal characteristics/dynamics of peripheral EBV-specific T cells can be useful as
indicators of clinical outcomes for NPC patients. To test these hypotheses, we will leverage our access to two
Singaporean NPC patient cohorts: Cohort 1. A 51-patient cohort of new-diagnosis NPC for which viably frozen
PBMCs and archival FFPE tissues are available and Cohort 2. A 50-patient cohort participating in a phase II
trial (NCT03097939 - National Cancer Centre Singapore) testing the combination of Ipilumimab and
Nivolumimab (Ipi.+Nivo.) immunotherapy with longitudinally collected PBMCs and tissue biopsies. Recently
published preliminary analysis (AACR 2020) from this clinical trial shows that combined Ipi.+Nivo. therapy is safe
and achieved durable responses in recurrent and metastatic NPC patients and identified a negative association
between circulating EBV-DNA levels and response. In addition, preliminary analysis of new-diagnosis NPC
patient peripheral blood samples from Cohort 1 show associations between certain phenotypic profiles of CD8+
T cells and clinical parameters such as EBV-DNA levels. Therefore, in Aim 1. we will investigate the clinical
relevance of these preliminarily identified NPC-associated CD8+ T cell phenotypes. In addition to in-depth single
cell transcriptional, functional TCR sequence profiling of these cells, cellular imaging, transcriptional profiling and
bulk TCR sequencing of patient-matched tumor will allow discovery of novel associations between peripheral T
cells and the tumor microenvironment. In Aim 2., we will characterize EBV-specific T cell responses in the NPC
periphery and tumor microenvironment during combination Ipi.+Nivo. immunotherapy treatment to identify novel
associations between the phenotypic profiles of EBV-specific T cells and immunotherapeutic response. In Aim
3., we will investigate T cell clonal dynamics associated with treatment induced changes to the NPC-specific
immune response by comparing the TCR clonal diversity in peripheral blood and tumor biopsy samples from
different stages of treatment. Overall, characterization of EBV-specific T cells phenotypes in the NPC periphery
and the tumor using multiple cutting-edge approaches will not only improve our understanding of the NPC
immune landscape, but also potentially identify clinically relevant EBV-specific T cell phenotypes that could be
tested in future NPC immunotherapy trials.","279150",

neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) are mechanisms thought to drive CICI, but how these
are triggered remains elusive.6,13-15 Our preliminary studies implicate CNS alterations of sphingolipid metabolism
and increased sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) formation, offering a novel target for therapeutic intervention with
S1P1 receptor subtype (S1PR1) antagonists.
 In preliminary studies of cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment, S1P increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
and hippocampus (key centers of cognition) where S1PR1 was expressed. This was associated with
mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) nitration and inactivation and activation of the NOD-, LRR- and
pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. MnSOD tightly regulates peroxynitrite (PN)-mediated
nitroxidative stress,16,17 but is also inactivated >80% when nitrated by PN.18-20 This PN-mediated process has
been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in many disease states.17-19,21-23 NLRP3 is critical for interleukin-1β
(IL1β) and IL18 maturation,24-26 powerful inflammatory cytokines in cognitive impairment.27-31 Systemic
administration of the orally bioavailable, CNS penetrant S1PR1 functional antagonist FTY72032 blocked MnSOD
nitration/inactivation, NLRP3 activation and attenuated CICI without adversly affecting locomotor activity
(preliminary data). These findings are very exciting, since FTY720 (fingolimod) is FDA-approved for multiple
sclerosis with good safety profiles.33-36 How chemotherapy triggers S1P/S1PR1 signaling is not known, but
preliminary data suggest glial cell toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a likely link.
We hypothesize that chemotherapy engages TLR4 to drive S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the CNS that contributes
to CICI through PN-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation (Fig. 1). We
will test this hypothesis in naïve and tumor-bearing male and female mice. In Aim 1, we will investigate
S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the CNS, temporal and cellular distribution of S1PR1 and test whether S1PR1
antagonists prevent and reverse CICI without interfering with antitumor effects. In Aim 2, we will use
pharmacological and genetic approaches to define the role of TLR4 in sphingolipid metabolism and S1P
formation during CICI and test the impact of S1PR1 inhibition on mitochondrial dysfunction and NLRP3-driven
neuroinflammation. S1PR1 antagonists are not expected to interfere with chemotherapy efficacy; we and others
have shown that these drugs block tumor cell growth, inflammation and metastasis.37-43 Our studies are
anticipated to provide paradigm-shifting insights that establish S1PR1 in CICI and expedite translational
investigation of medicines that are already FDA approved (fingolimod/ozanimod) as adjunct to chemotherapy.","442415",

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Opioid overdose (OD) fatalities have reached crisis levels in all socioeconomic and geographic communities
in the US. By utilizing a first-of-its-kind statewide Public Health Data Warehouse (PHD) with multiple
linked administrative datasets and state-of-the-art Bayesian spatiotemporal models, we are in a unique
position to fill in the fundamental gaps in the field’s ability to rapidly identify current OD patterns,
predict future OD epidemics, and evaluate the effectiveness of public health and clinical interventions.
In Massachusetts (MA), the State Legislature enacted policy in 2015 that provided authorization to the MA
Department of Public Health (MDPH) to develop a massively linked administrative dataset to allow public
health officials and policymakers to better understand the extent of and contributors to the opioid OD epidemic.
The PHD Warehouse, representing 98% of the MA population, currently links data from 25+ distinct sources
(e.g., death records, all-payer claims, post-mortem toxicology, hospital discharges, and the prescription
monitoring program). Supported by strong preliminary studies demonstrating the power of the PHD and our
strong partnership with MDPH, we aim to develop a new population health analytic framework to support opioid
OD control in MA that can be generalizable to other parts of the country. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop
a Bayesian multilevel spatiotemporal model to identify individual, interpersonal, community, and societal
factors that contribute to opioid OD; 2) develop an efficient Bayesian spatiotemporal model to identify time-
space OD clusters, and extend the model to construct a dynamic predictive model; and, 3) evaluate and
predict policy and intervention effects through model-based simulation studies to provide practical guidance
and decision-making support to public health officials. Aims 1, 2 and 3 can be easily adopted and reproduced
by users in other public health jurisdictions and sectors to foster cross-sector, cross-agency opioid OD control.
Our approach is innovative due to the use of PHD and sophisticated Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling
approaches. The proposed study is highly significant, because it is conceptualized to improve current and
future public health practice, facilitating data-driven and evidence-based implementation science interventions
in the locations at greatest risk and at the time when they are most needed. Our results can immediately and
significantly influence opioid OD prevention policies and practices, guiding pre-emptive public health and
clinical responses. We will develop our visualization tools, analytical approaches, and related code, in
collaboration with MDPH and our Community Advisory Board (CAB), to enhance PHD capabilities and improve
dissemination of findings. Our tools, approaches, and code will also be made available for national
dissemination, providing paradigm shifting approaches to address the opioid crisis. Our research directly
addresses NIDA’s goal to “Develop new and improved strategies to prevent drug use and its consequences.”","760041",

The proposed research is relevant and significant for public health because we anticipate identifying HDAC6 as
a novel therapeutic target for prevention as well as reversal of two frequent neurotoxic side effects of cancer
treatment: chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and chemotherapy-induced cognitive
impairment (CICI). CIPN and CICI significantly reduce quality of life during treatment of patients with cancer

 Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment
(CICI) are major side effects of cancer treatment that frequently persist long into survivorship. No drugs have
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent and/or adequately manage CIPN and CICI.
This application aims at filling this void. A concern when designing drugs to manage CIPN and CICI is that
they should not impair tumor control. Ideally, agents to control these neurotoxicities should also enhance
tumor control. Recent findings indicate that inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) meet these goals.
 HDAC6 de-acetylates non-histone cytosolic proteins like tubulin without inducing epigenetic changes.
Recent preclinical and clinical data show promise for HDAC6 inhibitors to improve tumor control. We
recently showed that HDAC6 inhibition fully reverses established CIPN in cisplatin-treated mice. This was
associated with restoration of mitochondrial health in sensory neurons. Preliminary data indicate that co-
administration of HDAC6 inhibitors protect against CIPN by preventing mitochondrial damage. Additional
preliminary data indicate that HDAC6 inhibition also reverses established CICI and associated brain
mitochondrial damage.
 Our hypothesis is that HDAC6 inhibition prevents and reverses CIPN and CICI in mice with or without
tumors by targeting mitochondrial health, oxidative stress, and downstream neuroimmune pathways. We will
test our hypothesis in 3 specific aims: Aim1: Determine the capacity of HDAC6 inhibitors to prevent CIPN in
mice with or without tumors. Aim 2: Determine the effect of HDAC6 inhibition on established CIPN. Aim 3:
Determine whether the beneficial effects of HDAC6 inhibition extend to CICI. In aims 1 and 3, we will
investigate the effect of HDAC6 inhibitors on tumor control and ensure that HDAC6 inhibitors also prevent
CIPN and CICI in the presence of a tumor.
 This study is innovative because we propose to target HDAC6 activity in neurons to control
neurotoxicities while at the same time enhancing cancer control. The expected outcome is significant because
it will identify HDAC6 inhibition as a realistic novel approach to control CIPN and CICI. This will increase the
quality of life of millions of cancer patients and survivors. Clinical trials to examine the effect of HDAC6
inhibitors on tumor control are already underway, and therefore the expected results of this project should
rapidly convince clinicians to examine the value of HDAC6 inhibitors for management of both CIPN and CICI.
Identification of HDAC6 inhibitors as drugs that can be used after completion of chemotherapy to completely
resolve established CIPN and CICI will be of great benefit for cancer survivors suffering every day from
these persistent neurotoxicities.","1",

Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is a common form of head and neck cancer that is driven by Epstein Barr
Virus (EBV) and especially prevalent in South East Asia at a rate of 15-50 cases per 100,000 people per year.
In this project, we will study two NPC cohorts, a 51-participant new-diagnosis cohort and a 50-participant
longitudinally sampled Phase II clinical trial cohort treated with the combination of anti-PD-1+anti-CTLA-4
(Ipilimumab+Nivolimumab) checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (cICI). With the goal better understanding the
role of peripheral EBV-specific and other NPC-associated T cell responses in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)
immunopathology, we will use a variety of single analysis methods applied to blood and tumor tissue to test the
hypotheses that EBV-specific T cells contribute to tumor control elicited by cICI and that the phenotypic and
clonal characteristics/dynamics of peripheral EBV-specific T cells can be useful as indicators of clinical outcomes
for NPC patients.","NCI","10281126","7/27/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-20-185","1R01CA264646-01","1","R01","CA","264646","01"," ","SOMMERS, CONNIE L","8/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2022 12:00:00 AM","Clinical Oncology Study Section[CONC]"," ","8740105","NEWELL, EVAN ","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","078200995","HMSNCM57QNR5","078200995","HMSNCM57QNR5","US","47.627342","-122.331593","861001","FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER","SEATTLE","WA","Research Institutes","981094433","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2022 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021","355610"," ","NCI","236376","119234"," ","Project Summary/Abstract
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven malignancy that is endemic to East and
Southeast Asia. The overall 5-year survival rate for endemic NPC is only 51%, which represents an unmet clinical
need. While NPC tumors are known to be infected with EBV and express PD-L1, little is known about the role of
EBV-specific T cells in the control of NPC and anti-PD-1 therapy has shown a low rate of efficacy (ORR ~20%).
The goal of this study is to better understand the role of EBV-specific T cell responses in NPC immunopathology
and immunotherapeutic response. We will test the specific hypotheses that: 1. EBV-specific T cells contribute to
tumor control elicited by combination anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, and 2.
that the phenotypic and clonal characteristics/dynamics of peripheral EBV-specific T cells can be useful as
indicators of clinical outcomes for NPC patients. To test these hypotheses, we will leverage our access to two
Singaporean NPC patient cohorts: Cohort 1. A 51-patient cohort of new-diagnosis NPC for which viably frozen
PBMCs and archival FFPE tissues are available and Cohort 2. A 50-patient cohort participating in a phase II
trial (NCT03097939 - National Cancer Centre Singapore) testing the combination of Ipilumimab and
Nivolumimab (Ipi.+Nivo.) immunotherapy with longitudinally collected PBMCs and tissue biopsies. Recently
published preliminary analysis (AACR 2020) from this clinical trial shows that combined Ipi.+Nivo. therapy is safe
and achieved durable responses in recurrent and metastatic NPC patients and identified a negative association
between circulating EBV-DNA levels and response. In addition, preliminary analysis of new-diagnosis NPC
patient peripheral blood samples from Cohort 1 show associations between certain phenotypic profiles of CD8+
T cells and clinical parameters such as EBV-DNA levels. Therefore, in Aim 1. we will investigate the clinical
relevance of these preliminarily identified NPC-associated CD8+ T cell phenotypes. In addition to in-depth single
cell transcriptional, functional TCR sequence profiling of these cells, cellular imaging, transcriptional profiling and
bulk TCR sequencing of patient-matched tumor will allow discovery of novel associations between peripheral T
cells and the tumor microenvironment. In Aim 2., we will characterize EBV-specific T cell responses in the NPC
periphery and tumor microenvironment during combination Ipi.+Nivo. immunotherapy treatment to identify novel
associations between the phenotypic profiles of EBV-specific T cells and immunotherapeutic response. In Aim
3., we will investigate T cell clonal dynamics associated with treatment induced changes to the NPC-specific
immune response by comparing the TCR clonal diversity in peripheral blood and tumor biopsy samples from
different stages of treatment. Overall, characterization of EBV-specific T cells phenotypes in the NPC periphery
and the tumor using multiple cutting-edge approaches will not only improve our understanding of the NPC
immune landscape, but also potentially identify clinically relevant EBV-specific T cell phenotypes that could be
tested in future NPC immunotherapy trials.","355610",

 Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment
(CICI) are major side effects of cancer treatment that frequently persist long into survivorship. No drugs have
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent and/or adequately manage CIPN and CICI.

 HDAC6 de-acetylates non-histone cytosolic proteins like tubulin without inducing epigenetic changes.

recently showed that HDAC6 inhibition fully reverses established CIPN in cisplatin-treated mice. This was

mitochondrial damage.
 Our hypothesis is that HDAC6 inhibition prevents and reverses CIPN and CICI in mice with or without
tumors by targeting mitochondrial health, oxidative stress, and downstream neuroimmune pathways. We will

This application addresses the Provocative Question 9: ""What are the molecular and/or cellular mechanisms
that underlie the development of cancer therapy-induced severe adverse sequelae?"" focusing on
Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments (CICI). CICI is now a recognized toxicity syndrome that includes
loss of executive function (confusion; memory issues), inability to multitask, and impaired intellectual
reasoning. While CICI caused by central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapies (such as radiation and
intrathecal chemotherapy) is readily understood, the mechanisms underlying a critical and shared toxicity of
chemotherapy that occurs after systemic cancer treatment with drugs that did not direct at the brain, are
unclear. The number of patients at risk for CICI from systemic therapy far exceeds the number of patients
exposed to CNS therapy, but little is known about the mechanisms mediating the effect of systemic therapy on
CICI, and there is no clear vision of how to prevent this condition. We have previously shown that generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs is an essential mediator of brain injury
even though the drug itself did not get into the brain. It is also imperative to note that anticancer medications,
designed specifically to target cancer cells with specialized features, such as the family of Bcl2 inhibitors, also
generate ROS. However, the effect of targeted therapy on CICI has never been addressed, and,
consequently, their mechanisms of action are entirely unknown. The goal of this proposal is to test the overall
hypothesis that therapy-induced ROS production in the target tissues leads to increased circulating TNFα
through extracellular vesicles (EVs)-mediated reactions, and this pro-inflammatory cytokine crosses the blood
brain barrier to elicit mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent neuronal injury leading to CICI. The following
specific aims are designed to test the ROS hypothesis, gain an understanding of the EVs-mediated
mechanisms, and test the proof-of-concept in an experimental cancer therapy setting using two prototype
chemotherapy agents (Doxorubicin and Venetoclax) that represent standard cytotoxic and experimental
targeted drugs in a lymphoma model. Aim 1 will investigate the fundamental role of TNFα in therapy-induced
neuronal injury to gain insights into mechanisms of CICI in the brain and demonstrate efficacy of chemotherapy
in the presence of redox-active antioxidants. Aim 2 will determine the mechanistic links between circulating
extracellular vesicles and therapy-induced CICI. Aim 3 will define the cell(s) of origin of TNFα produced during
chemotherapy that leads to cognitive impairment. These aims will be accomplished in vitro and in vivo using
state-of-the-art technologies, including magnetic resonance spectroscopy, redox proteomics, unique animal
models, and novel mitochondria targeting anti-oxidant, MnP, to ameliorate CICI without reducing the efficacy of
the anti-cancer drugs. The results from this project will lay important groundwork for future clinical trials to
improve the quality of lives of cancer patients exposed to cytotoxic or targeted therapies.","458815",

CICI, and there is no clear vision of how to prevent this condition. We have previously shown that generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs is an essential mediator of brain injury
even though the drug itself did not get into the brain. It is also imperative to note that anticancer medications,
designed specifically to target cancer cells with specialized features, such as the family of Bcl2 inhibitors, also
generate ROS. However, the effect of targeted therapy on CICI has never been addressed, and,
consequently, their mechanisms of action are entirely unknown. The goal of this proposal is to test the overall
hypothesis that therapy-induced ROS production in the target tissues leads to increased circulating TNFα
through extracellular vesicles (EVs)-mediated reactions, and this pro-inflammatory cytokine crosses the blood
brain barrier to elicit mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent neuronal injury leading to CICI. The following
specific aims are designed to test the ROS hypothesis, gain an understanding of the EVs-mediated
mechanisms, and test the proof-of-concept in an experimental cancer therapy setting using two prototype
chemotherapy agents (Doxorubicin and Venetoclax) that represent standard cytotoxic and experimental
targeted drugs in a lymphoma model. Aim 1 will investigate the fundamental role of TNFα in therapy-induced
neuronal injury to gain insights into mechanisms of CICI in the brain and demonstrate efficacy of chemotherapy
in the presence of redox-active antioxidants. Aim 2 will determine the mechanistic links between circulating
extracellular vesicles and therapy-induced CICI. Aim 3 will define the cell(s) of origin of TNFα produced during
chemotherapy that leads to cognitive impairment. These aims will be accomplished in vitro and in vivo using
state-of-the-art technologies, including magnetic resonance spectroscopy, redox proteomics, unique animal
models, and novel mitochondria targeting anti-oxidant, MnP, to ameliorate CICI without reducing the efficacy of
the anti-cancer drugs. The results from this project will lay important groundwork for future clinical trials to
improve the quality of lives of cancer patients exposed to cytotoxic or targeted therapies.","463899",

The proposed research is relevant and significant for public health because we anticipate identifying HDAC6 as
a novel therapeutic target for prevention as well as reversal of two frequent neurotoxic side effects of cancer
treatment: chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and chemotherapy-induced cognitive
impairment (CICI). CIPN and CICI significantly reduce quality of life during treatment of patients with cancer
and often last long into survivorship. Clinical trials to examine the effect of HDAC6 inhibitors on tumor control
are already underway, and therefore rapid clinical application of HDAC6 inhibitors to manage CIPN and CICI
upon succesful completion of this project should be realistic.","NCI","9515204","5/21/2018 12:00:00 AM","RFA-CA-17-017","1R01CA227064-01","1","R01","CA","227064","01"," ","ST GERMAIN, DIANE","5/22/2018 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2023 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-SRB-A(J1)R"," ","9562595","KAVELAARS, ANNEMIEKE ","HEIJNEN, COBI J","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","5/22/2018 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2019 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2018","366766"," ","NCI","229229","137537"," ","SUMMARY
 Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment
(CICI) are major side effects of cancer treatment that frequently persist long into survivorship. No drugs have
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent and/or adequately manage CIPN and CICI.
This application aims at filling this void. A concern when designing drugs to manage CIPN and CICI is that
they should not impair tumor control. Ideally, agents to control these neurotoxicities should also enhance
tumor control. Recent findings indicate that inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) meet these goals.
 HDAC6 de-acetylates non-histone cytosolic proteins like tubulin without inducing epigenetic changes.
Recent preclinical and clinical data show promise for HDAC6 inhibitors to improve tumor control. We
recently showed that HDAC6 inhibition fully reverses established CIPN in cisplatin-treated mice. This was
associated with restoration of mitochondrial health in sensory neurons. Preliminary data indicate that co-
administration of HDAC6 inhibitors protect against CIPN by preventing mitochondrial damage. Additional
preliminary data indicate that HDAC6 inhibition also reverses established CICI and associated brain
mitochondrial damage.
 Our hypothesis is that HDAC6 inhibition prevents and reverses CIPN and CICI in mice with or without
tumors by targeting mitochondrial health, oxidative stress, and downstream neuroimmune pathways. We will
test our hypothesis in 3 specific aims: Aim1: Determine the capacity of HDAC6 inhibitors to prevent CIPN in
mice with or without tumors. Aim 2: Determine the effect of HDAC6 inhibition on established CIPN. Aim 3:
Determine whether the beneficial effects of HDAC6 inhibition extend to CICI. In aims 1 and 3, we will
investigate the effect of HDAC6 inhibitors on tumor control and ensure that HDAC6 inhibitors also prevent
CIPN and CICI in the presence of a tumor.
 This study is innovative because we propose to target HDAC6 activity in neurons to control
neurotoxicities while at the same time enhancing cancer control. The expected outcome is significant because
it will identify HDAC6 inhibition as a realistic novel approach to control CIPN and CICI. This will increase the
quality of life of millions of cancer patients and survivors. Clinical trials to examine the effect of HDAC6
inhibitors on tumor control are already underway, and therefore the expected results of this project should
rapidly convince clinicians to examine the value of HDAC6 inhibitors for management of both CIPN and CICI.
Identification of HDAC6 inhibitors as drugs that can be used after completion of chemotherapy to completely
resolve established CIPN and CICI will be of great benefit for cancer survivors suffering every day from
these persistent neurotoxicities.","366766",

Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a serious threat to the quality of life. This project is
designed to identify practice-changing therapy by establishing a new paradigm, which recognizes that ROS is
the initiator of CICI, caused by both cytotoxic and targeted drugs. Results from these studies will lead to very
concrete information potentially offering a specific course of action to develop effective clinical approaches
specifically designed to prevent CICI without reducing chemotherapeutic efficacy.","NCI","9363914","9/15/2017 12:00:00 AM","RFA-CA-15-008","1R01CA217934-01","1","R01","CA","217934","01"," ","CHEN, WEIWEI","9/15/2017 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2022 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-RTRB-E(M2)"," ","3147341","ST CLAIR, DARET K","BONDADA, SUBBARAO ; BUTTERFIELD, D.

This application addresses the Provocative Question 9: ""What are the molecular and/or cellular mechanisms
that underlie the development of cancer therapy-induced severe adverse sequelae?"" focusing on
Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments (CICI). CICI is now a recognized toxicity syndrome that includes
loss of executive function (confusion; memory issues), inability to multitask, and impaired intellectual
reasoning. While CICI caused by central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapies (such as radiation and
intrathecal chemotherapy) is readily understood, the mechanisms underlying a critical and shared toxicity of
chemotherapy that occurs after systemic cancer treatment with drugs that did not direct at the brain, are
unclear. The number of patients at risk for CICI from systemic therapy far exceeds the number of patients
exposed to CNS therapy, but little is known about the mechanisms mediating the effect of systemic therapy on
CICI, and there is no clear vision of how to prevent this condition. We have previously shown that generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs is an essential mediator of brain injury
even though the drug itself did not get into the brain. It is also imperative to note that anticancer medications,
