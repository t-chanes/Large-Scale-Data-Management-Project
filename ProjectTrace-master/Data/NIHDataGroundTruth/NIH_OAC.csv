Atrial fibrillation disproportionately impacts patients with cirrhosis, yet little is known about the
comparative effectiveness and safety of oral anticoagulants (OAC), in this high-risk population.
The proposed study will provide robust and timely evidence regarding the effects of specific OAC
strategies in patients with cirrhosis and atrial fibrillation, to better inform clinical care and optimize
OAC prescribing and stroke prevention. This work will also yield a highly flexible and generalizable
infrastructure for assessing therapeutic drug effects in vulnerable patients with cirrhosis.","NHLBI","10559071","2/17/2023 12:00:00 AM","PA-20-185","1R01HL167021-01","1","R01","HL","167021","01"," ","DESVIGNE-NICKENS, PATRICE","3/1/2023 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2028 12:00:00 AM","Health Services: Quality and Effectiveness Study Section[HSQE]"," ","14593774","SIMON, TRACEY ","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","US","42.336107","-71.107481","1080401","BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021156110","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2023 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2024 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2023","889086"," ","NHLBI","496696","392390"," ","ABSTRACT
The prevalence of and mortality from cirrhosis have increased dramatically over the past twenty years. Atrial
fibrillation (NVAF) disproportionately affects 15% of patients with cirrhosis and leads to substantial morbidity and
mortality, including 5-fold higher rates of stroke. In the general population with NVAF, the risk-benefit balance
typically favors initiation of oral anticoagulants (OAC). In contrast, over 50% of patients with cirrhosis and NVAF
are not anticoagulated despite their markedly increased risk of stroke, due to concerns about bleeding, poor
anticoagulation quality and falls. These concerns also complicate selection of an optimal OAC regimen, which
involves choosing between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC: apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran
and edoxaban). While DOACs have potential benefits over warfarin in patients with cirrhosis, they have variable
hepatic metabolism (between 20%-75%) and they are largely untested in cirrhosis, because such patients were
excluded from all prior DOAC randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for NVAF. Moreover, RCTs are unlikely to
recruit and retain vulnerable patients with advanced, decompensated cirrhosis or cognitive impairments in a
manner representative of routine care. Thus, for patients with cirrhosis and NVAF – who are at higher risk of
both bleeding and thrombosis – there is a pressing need for robust data regarding the optimal OAC strategy.
This proposal seeks to define the comparative effectiveness and safety of warfarin and DOACs in a population-
based cohort of over 250,000 U.S. adults with established cirrhosis and NVAF diagnosed between 2011-2019
(including over 100,000 new OAC initiators), from 4 healthcare databases (Medicare, Medicaid, Truven
MarketScan and Optum Clinformatics). Within this cohort, we propose: (Aim 1) To define the effectiveness and
safety of use vs. non-use of OACs (including warfarin and specific DOACs); (Aim 2) To define the comparative
effectiveness and safety of initiating (2a) warfarin vs. DOACs; and (2b) specific DOACs (i.e. head-to-head
comparisons of, apixaban vs. rivaroxaban vs. dabigatran vs. edoxaban); and (Aim 3) To identify key subgroups
for whom OACs are particularly beneficial or hazardous – including patients with advanced or decompensated
cirrhosis, high fall risk or poor predicted anticoagulation quality. To minimize confounding and optimize study
validity, we will use innovative methods developed by our team, including: (i) high-dimensional propensity scores;
(ii) our novel, validated algorithms for phenotyping cirrhosis severity, fall risk and anticoagulation quality; and (iii)
linkage of a subset of our cohort with rich clinical information and laboratory data from electronic health records
(EHR), for external adjustment and propensity score calibration. Completing these studies will provide the
necessary evidence base for providers to optimize OAC selection and stroke prevention in vulnerable patients
with cirrhosis and NVAF, yielding an immediate and direct public health benefit. This work will also produce
a readily generalizable infrastructure for robustly detecting drug effects in patients with chronic liver disease.","889086",

Specific Aims
One hundred and forty-three million children are estimated to have lost one or both parents, 15 million of these
to AIDS.1 Millions more have been abandoned by their parents. While Africa is most often referenced when
discussing the orphan burden, South and Southeast Asian countries are caring for 67.5 million orphans.1 In
both Africa and Asia, high mortality among young parents from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis,
HIV/AIDS, pregnancy complications, injuries, and natural disasters are responsible for the large and increasing
number of orphans.2 Most children in less wealthy nations are orphaned not at birth but at older ages;1,3-4
36% of all orphans and 29% of double orphans are aged 6-11; almost half of single orphans and nearly two-
thirds of double orphans are aged 12-17.5 Because of this, the study of older orphaned and abandoned
children (OAC) is vitally important: knowledge is needed regarding the caregiving characteristics that result in
positive outcomes for adolescents and young adults who are orphaned or abandoned, as is an understanding
of how to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to and from this potentially high risk population.
 Policy makers recognize the importance of addressing the needs of orphans: through PEPFAR, the US alone
has committed $43 billion over 5 years to services for orphans.6 However, the knowledge base of locally
feasible and culturally appropriate ways to support positive outcomes for OAC is astonishingly small. The few
studies that have been conducted tend to be of a single country and cross sectional, and do not have randomly
selected care settings or samples. Additional evidence is required to identify positive and negative caregiving
characteristics that transcend structure and culture in order to identify how to provide locally feasible and
acceptable care for the millions of OAC in need.
 Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO I) followed more than 3,000 randomly selected OAC, half from
family and half from institutional care settings, living in 6 culturally, politically, historically and religiously distinct
sites representing nearly 100 ethnicities in 5 less wealthy nations. OAC aged 6 to 12 at enrollment were
followed for 2-3 years, with a retention rate of >87%. POFO I aims were to understand predictors of physical
and emotional wellbeing and cognitive development. POFO I received international attention as the first multi-
country observational study to follow a large cohort of post-toddler OAC, examining the caregiving structures
and characteristics that predict positive and negative outcomes. POFO I demonstrated that there were few
differences, on average, between institution- and family-dwelling OAC across various dimensions of physical
health, cognition, and emotional difficulties, but substantial variation within groups, indicating that caregiving
characteristics and children's life circumstances, rather than residential structure, determine OAC wellbeing. 7
Other findings in manuscripts to date include that caregivers' health and wellbeing are the strongest predictors
of OAC's health and engagement in excessive labor;8-9 and that for most of the OAC, the loss of a parent was
only one in a series of potentially traumatic events, and that as the number of events increased, so did their
emotional difficulties.10 The unique importance of the study has been recognized through invitations to present
findings to an OVC expert think-tank meeting hosted by USAID/NIH,11 a UNICEF/UNAIDS/UN OVC policy
recommendations meeting,12 and personal meetings with leaders at UNICEF to discuss policy implications of
POFO I findings that were highly publicized in national and international media (Appendix A). UNICEF's Child
Protection Section formed an ongoing working group to advise POFO I analyses, and some of the most
influential OAC researchers have agreed to participate on the POFO Advisory Board and/or to advise and
support the research in other ways (Appendix B, ""POFO Advisory Board"", and Letters of Support)
 As we continue to meet the aims of POFO I (16 additional manuscripts are underway or outlined), the
participating children are transitioning to adolescence and young adulthood, perfectly positioning this cohort to
help us understand predictors of positive outcomes as well as predictors of negative outcomes such as
behaviors that will put them at high risk for HIV. High rates of exposure to multiple traumatic events and the
absence of familial care and protection may make OAC more likely than others to engage in HIV risk taking
behaviors and other adverse outcomes. To examine these essential questions, we request a 5-year
continuation to follow the POFO I cohort to ages 14 to 20. By identifying predictors of these outcomes,
critical knowledge will be gained to help inform local and global policies and programs that promote positive
and mitigate negative outcomes.
Aim 1: Identify predictors of 3 interpersonal relationship outcomes: HIV risk behaviors, reproductive
health, and family formation. Intrapersonal, interpersonal and community level factors are hypothesized to
be associated with OAC's HIV risk behaviors (including sexual risk and drug use/abuse), reproductive health
(including pregnancy, pregnancy-related morbidity, and HSV-2), and family formation (marriage/partnership).
Aim 2: Identify predictors of 3 achievement outcomes: continued education, income generating
activities (IGAs) and civic engagement. Intrapersonal, interpersonal and community level factors are
hypothesized to be associated with OAC's continued education (highest grade completed), income generating
activities (earnings) and civic engagement.","NICHD","8707794","7/16/2014 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01HD046345-10","5","R01","HD","046345","10"," ","LEE, KAREN","8/1/2005 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2017 12:00:00 AM","Behavioral and Social Science Approaches to Preventing HIV/AIDS Study Section[BSPH]"," ","6605524","WHETTEN, KATHRYN ","Not Applicable","04","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","US","36.007766","-78.926475","2221101","DUKE UNIVERSITY","DURHAM","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","277054673","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2014 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2017 12:00:00 AM","865","Non-SBIR/STTR","2014","529633"," ","NICHD","369657","159976"," ","  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide, 143 million children are estimated to have lost one or both parents, 15 million to HIV/AIDS alone. Millions more children have been abandoned and are in need of care. The need to understand individual, family, community, and structural factors influencing positive outcomes for orphaned and abandoned children (OAC) across and within different cultures is pressing.  The goal of this competing renewal application is to continue to follow an existing cohort of more than 3,000 randomly selected OAC in six culturally diverse study sites in Cambodia, Ethiopia, India (Nagaland and Hyderabad), Kenya, and Tanzania. Children enrolled in the Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) cohort were aged 6-12 at baseline; half were enrolled from family settings, half from 83 institutional care settings. Children were followed for 2-3 years with a retention rate of >87%.  POFO children will be aged 10-16 at the close of the study in May 2010 and are transitioning to adolescence and young adulthood, perfectly positioning the cohort to help us understand predictors of positive outcomes such as retention in school, employment opportunities, and civic engagement, and predictors of negative outcomes such as high risk sexual and drug use behaviors, early pregnancy, and engagement in sex trade. Many of the OAC in this cohort were orphaned or abandoned due to HIV/AIDS, the consequences of which may now place them at risk for engaging in behaviors that make them more likely to become HIV infected and/or spread the disease.  We propose to follow this cohort for 4 years and examine the influence of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community level factors on: 3 behavioral and relationship outcomes: HIV risk behaviors, reproductive health, and family formation, and 3 achievement outcomes: continued education, income generating activities (IGAs) and civic engagement. The cohort will be followed through ages 14-20 during the proposed study period.  Building on the success of POFO I, which has received international attention, this application has the highest level of support from Duke University and organizations in each of the countries with which we have been working, and a study-specific Advisory Board has been formed to help guide POFO I analyses and POFO II design and implementation. A minimum of 7 peer-reviewed manuscripts, a major policy document, and a book will result from this study. These documents will advise policymakers, programmers, and researchers on the caregiving and cultural characteristics that need consideration when planning for the transition of millions of orphaned children from childhood into young adulthood.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide, 143 million children are estimated to have lost one or both parents, 15 million to HIV/AIDS alone. Millions more children have been abandoned and are in need of care. The need to understand individual, family, community, and structural factors influencing positive outcomes for orphaned and abandoned children (OAC) across and within different cultures is pressing.  The goal of this competing renewal application is to continue to follow an existing cohort of more than 3,000 randomly selected OAC in six culturally diverse study sites in Cambodia, Ethiopia, India (Nagaland and Hyderabad), Kenya, and Tanzania. Children enrolled in the Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) cohort were aged 6-12 at baseline; half were enrolled from family settings, half from 83 institutional care settings. Children were followed for 2-3 years with a retention rate of >87%.  POFO children will be aged 10-16 at the close of the study in May 2010 and are transitioning to adolescence and young adulthood, perfectly positioning the cohort to help us understand predictors of positive outcomes such as retention in school, employment opportunities, and civic engagement, and predictors of negative outcomes such as high risk sexual and drug use behaviors, early pregnancy, and engagement in sex trade. Many of the OAC in this cohort were orphaned or abandoned due to HIV/AIDS, the consequences of which may now place them at risk for engaging in behaviors that make them more likely to become HIV infected and/or spread the disease.  We propose to follow this cohort for 4 years and examine the influence of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community level factors on: 3 behavioral and relationship outcomes: HIV risk behaviors, reproductive health, and family formation, and 3 achievement outcomes: continued education, income generating activities (IGAs) and civic engagement. The cohort will be followed through ages 14-20 during the proposed study period.  Building on the success of POFO I, which has received international attention, this application has the highest level of support from Duke University and organizations in each of the countries with which we have been working, and a study-specific Advisory Board has been formed to help guide POFO I analyses and POFO II design and implementation. A minimum of 7 peer-reviewed manuscripts, a major policy document, and a book will result from this study. These documents will advise policymakers, programmers, and researchers on the caregiving and cultural characteristics that need consideration when planning for the transition of millions of orphaned children from childhood into young adulthood.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to understand intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community level factors influencing positive outcomes for orphaned and abandoned children (OAC) across and within different cultures is pressing. This competing continuation for the Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) study will identify such factors by continuing to follow more than 3,000 OAC as they transition to adolescence and young adulthood.

A multidisciplinary approach has been developed that combines protein expression, purification, and characterization with the physical organic chemistry and organic synthesis techniques required for new reaction development. In particular, the reactions under study are designed to be orthogonal to existing lysine- and cysteine-based strategies, and thus can be used in concert with these tried-and-true methods. By targeting underutilized functional groups and by enhancing reaction selectivity between similar functionality, it is also anticipated that many entirely new avenues for protein labeling, protein immobilization, and de novo protein synthesis will emerge from these studies.   
  
Specifically, two powerful new strategies will be developed for the facile modification of tyrosine residues on protein surfaces. The first uses diazonium-coupling reactions to activate tyrosine residues, followed by a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction for further conjugation. Start to finish, this procedure takes as little as three hours to carry out, and can be used to couple alkenes and alkynes to tyrosines with absolute selectivity. The second strategy is a new three-component Mannich-based coupling reaction that can modify tyrosine residues with exquisite selectivity and simultaneously install two new functional groups. This reaction will be explored for as a new strategy for protein ligation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) exist in a variety of subtypes which play distinct roles in neuronal function in health and disease, and provide specific drug targets. AChRs are important in the pathological mechanisms of tobacco addiction and Parkinson's disease, and are potential drug targets in many diseases including Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and ADHD. It is important to investigate the synthesis and functional properties of subtypes of human AChRs expressed in simple model systems in order to help explain their roles in complex genetically manipulated rodent nervous systems (e.g. knock out and knock in mice), and in humans. It is also important to develop systems in which highly selective drugs can be detected and their effects characterized. AChRs are formed from five homologous subunits organized around a central cation channel. Most AChRs are heteromeric, with two ACh binding sites formed by subunit pairs (e.g. a4¿2) and a fifth ""accessory"" subunit (e.g. ¿2, ¿3,a4, or a5) combined to form different AChR stoichiometries (e.g. (a4¿2)2¿2 or (a4¿2) 2a4 or subtypes (e.g.(a4¿2) 2a5). Our studies have revealed that accessory subunits influence efficiency of assembly, cation selectivity, as well as sensitivities to activation, desensitization, and allosteric modulators. Thus, it is especially important to investigate the roles of accessory subunits. Properties of a2 subunits are little known, but need investigation because they are more prominent in primates than rodents. AChRs containing a6 and ¿3 subunits (among others, hence the designation a6* AChRs) are found almost exclusively in aminergic neuron endings where, for example, they modulate the release of dopamine. a6* AChRs are required for addiction to nicotine. They promote dopamine release from the same neurons that are lost in Parkinson's disease. They may also help mediate the neuroprotective effects of nicotine on these neurons, and may be important in ADHD and other diseases. a6 AChRs play an even larger role in dopamine release in primates than rodents. Thus, a6* AChRs offer excellent drug targets. Study of a6* AChR subtypes is important but difficult. Our preliminary results are encouraging. The use of linked subunits has allowed us to express a6* AChRs of defined subtypes, stoichiometries, and subunit orders. We have developed conditions for expressing a6* AChRs in transfected cell lines. Aim 1 is to characterize alternate stoichiometries (e.g. (a4¿2)2¿2 and (a4¿2)2 and alternate subtypes (e.g. (a4¿2)2a5) of cloned human a4* and a2* AChRs expressed in pure forms. Aim 2 is to efficiently express and functionally characterize cloned human a6* AChR subtypes. mAbs to the defined conformation dependent epitopes on the extracellular surface of a2, a6, ¿3 and other subunits will be developed using novel AChR subunit/ACh binding protein chimeras as immunogens and will be used to study synthesis of these AChRs.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nicotine acts through nicotinic receptors to cause addiction to tobacco, which results in more than 400,000 deaths/year in the United States. These receptors are found in the brain, peripheral nervous system and many non-neuronal tissues. Drugs directed at these receptors will help to reduce addiction to tobacco and may help treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as many other neuronal and non-neuronal diseases. We have made a unique and growing collection of cell lines which express specific receptor subtypes. We also have a unique and growing library of monoclonal antibodies to the subunits of these receptors. Our studies will increase the understanding of how these receptors assemble and function normally and under the influence of nicotine and nicotinic drugs. The cell lines that we prepare can be used to detect and evaluate new drugs directed at these receptors.

A multidisciplinary approach has been developed that combines protein expression, purification, and characterization with the physical organic chemistry and organic synthesis techniques required for new reaction development. In particular, the reactions under study are designed to be orthogonal to existing lysine- and cysteine-based strategies, and thus can be used in concert with these tried-and-true methods.

Specifically, two powerful new strategies will be developed for the facile modification of tyrosine residues on protein surfaces. The first uses diazonium-coupling reactions to activate tyrosine residues, followed by a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction for further conjugation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of the proposed research are the development, mechanistic description, and application of new methodology for the synthesis of 2-amino sugars, crucial molecular components and precursors in biological systems, including structural polymers, enzyme inhibitors, and cell-surface glycoproteins. The synthetic approach uses glycal 3-carbamates as starting materials and proceeds through a tandem alkene amidation-glycosylation sequence-amidoglycosylation-to introduce nitrogen at C2 of the sugar framework and to establish an anomeric linkage to a nucleophilic reaction partner, the glycosyl acceptor. Iodosobenzene carries out this overall oxidation, in a process best catalyzed by dirhodium(II) carboxylates and apparently involving a rhodium-complexed acyl nitrene intermediate. The amidation step is intramolecular, forging the C2-N bond on the more hindered glycal face, and, ideally, glycosylation should occur stereospecifically, anti to the newly incorporated nitrogen substituent. While certain glycal 3-carbamates react with efficiency and high anomeric stereoselectivity, other substrates with potentially high synthetic value provide substantial amounts of C3-oxidized dihydropyranone byproducts and low stereocontrol in the glycosylation step. Using the mechanistic hypotheses that (1) both amidoglycosylation and C3 oxidation occur via a common metallanitrene intermediate and (2) stereoselective glycosylation requires neighboring-group participation from the C2 nitrogen, probably by way of a glycosyl aziridine, this application outlines how controlling the conformation of the glycal 3-carbamate framework will enable both high chemo- and stereoselectivity in the amidoglycosylation reactions. Other proposed investigations will further illuminate mechanistic details of the reactions, providing crucial information for improving and increasing the utility and scope of amidoglycosylation for the preparation of amino sugars. With input from both the method development and mechanistic study components of the proposed project, this application outlines the completion of a synthesis of the disaccharide portion of the potent chitinase inhibitor allosamidin. Iterative application of the amidoglycosylation technology will enable streamlined preparation of an allosamidin disaccharide module readily amenable for analogue synthesis. To be conducted at Barnard College, an undergraduate liberal arts college for women, the project will provide students with numerous opportunities in organic chemical synthesis, helping to attract and propel them into careers in chemistry and other health-related professions. Because amino sugars are constituents of numerous biochemical systems and medicinally active compounds, improved methods for their synthesis can contribute to efforts aimed at understanding and treating human diseases. The proposed research will develop new ways of preparing 2-amino sugars with the precise control of reactivity and molecular geometry that is required for application to problems in bio- and medicinal chemistry. This methodology will be used to synthesize a key amino sugar segment of the molecule allosamidin, a substance that inhibits a class of enzymes known as chitinases and may provide a basis for the design of compounds for treating asthma.

A multidisciplinary approach has been developed that combines protein expression, purification, and characterization with the physical organic chemistry and organic synthesis techniques required for new reaction development. In particular, the reactions under study are designed to be orthogonal to existing lysine- and cysteine-based strategies, and thus can be used in concert with these tried-and-true methods. By targeting underutilized functional groups and by enhancing reaction selectivity between similar functionality, it is also anticipated that many entirely new avenues for protein labeling, protein immobilization, and de novo protein synthesis will emerge from these studies.   
  
Specifically, two powerful new strategies will be developed for the facile modification of tyrosine residues on protein surfaces. The first uses diazonium-coupling reactions to activate tyrosine residues, followed by a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction for further conjugation. Start to finish, this procedure takes as little as three hours to carry out, and can be used to couple alkenes and alkynes to tyrosines with absolute selectivity. The second strategy is a new three-component Mannich-based coupling reaction that can modify tyrosine residues with exquisite selectivity and simultaneously install two new functional groups. This reaction will be explored for as a new strategy for protein ligation.  
  
Transition-metal catalyzed reactions will also be explored, as they offer many opportunities for highly selective reactions and the activation of currently unmodifiable functional groups. In particular, the development of a metal carbene-based strategy for disulfide bonds will be explored as a means to modify antibody fragments and N-terminal methionine residues.","269507",
