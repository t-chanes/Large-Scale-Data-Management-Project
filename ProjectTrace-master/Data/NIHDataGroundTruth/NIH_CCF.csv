This project will continue operation of the Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on the
successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal
neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP
include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities;
(ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high quality imaging data; and
(iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP
data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF builds on these accomplishments and
serves the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support
services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with
those of the HCP. To this end, we have established a help desk whose support functions include transfer of
data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for
these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for
different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A
second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These
services include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project’s behavioral data are
obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This entails coordination with data contributors to develop and
maitain mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database.
The data from each study include the acquired images and all data associated with the project’s behavioral
battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures based on existing HCP methods are executed to
generate quality metrics that are published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines are then run in order
to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database.
A third aim is to maintain the existing data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it
to include connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded under the Connectomes Related
to Human Diseases program. Together, these three aims enable the CCF to serve a central hub for
connectomics data aggregation and harmonization. The CCF’s suite of harmonization services from data
acquisition through data sharing ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The
resulting database enables the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain
function in health and disease.","187852",

Epigenetic clocks are widely used in geroscience but little known about their modifiability and behavior across
the lifespan. Here we use a human cellular lifespan system that recapitulates key hallmarks of human aging
(DNA methylation signatures, ccf-mtDNA, inflammation) to map individualized trajectories in the rate of
epigenetic aging among cells from healthy women and men, in response to glucocorticoid stress, and to
targeted mitochondrial dysfunction. These high-resolution longitudinal multi-system data will provide new
insights into inter-individual differences in aging trajectories, the modifiability of epigenetic clocks, and provide
causal evidence for the of mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential biological determinant of epigenetic aging.","NIA","10543439","1/19/2023 12:00:00 AM","PA-19-056","5R01AG066828-04","5","R01","AG","066828","04"," ","GUO, MAX","4/15/2020 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2024 12:00:00 AM","Aging Systems and Geriatrics Study Section[ASG]"," ","14188763","PICARD, MARTIN ","Not Applicable","13","Unavailable","167204994","TYVNMW8FNQQ3","167204994","TYVNMW8FNQQ3","US","40.843076","-73.944206","1590919","NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE DBA RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR MENTAL HYGIENE, INC","NEW YORK","NY","Independent Hospitals","100321007","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2023 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2023 12:00:00 AM","866","Non-SBIR/STTR","2023","641697"," ","NIA","467558","174139"," ","There are substantial inter-individual differences in biological aging trajectories, but the origin of these
differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are
mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic
modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients
with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the
epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with
advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms
called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large
human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known
about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic
factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both
stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular
lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated
about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e.,
the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm
aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global
DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be
validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of
DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging
pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose
cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to
accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based
DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2,
p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic
age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other
aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between
epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of
cellular aging in a human system.","641697",

The incidences of liver cancer (primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) are increasing and disease outcome
is poor. Consequently, there is an urgent need for new therapies and preventive strategies. Age is a major risk
for HCC and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a chronic liver disease that encompasses a
progressive range of disorders of increasing severity and risk of HCC, from benign fatty liver (steatosis), to
inflammatory non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. Aging is accompanied by many
molecular, cellular and tissue changes that are candidate drivers of NAFLD and HCC, including the “hallmarks
of aging” that are dysregulated with age in diverse tissues and organisms; for example, changes to mitochondria,
metabolism, the epigenome, accumulation of senescent cells, inflammation and immune changes.
 Cell senescence is caused by a range of cellular stresses and characterized by an irreversible
proliferation arrest and a potent pro-inflammatory phenotype, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP). Recently, we showed that in senescent cells, mitochondria dysfunction signals to evict fragments of
chromatin from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF)) via a nucleus-to-
cytoplasmic blebbing process. CCF are sensed by the anti-viral cytoplasmic DNA sensing apparatus to activate
NFkB and the SASP. The SASP of senescent cells includes interferons, a family of cytokines involved in cell
intrinsic anti-viral mechanisms, control of cell proliferation, inflammation and adaptive immunity, and tumor
suppressive and oncogenic processes. Although SASP and acute IFN signaling have important benefits, chronic
SASP and IFN signaling can be detrimental. As a source of chronic inflammation, SASP promotes tissue aging
and disease, including liver cancer. Chronic IFN signaling can promote immunosuppression, in part by
upregulation of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1.
 Based on unpublished data, we hypothesize that accumulation of CCF in aged and/or senescent liver
hepatocytes drives chronic activation of IFN signaling, expression of IFN target genes and immune checkpoint
inhibitors, such as PD-L1. We further hypothesize that this, in turn, generates an immunosuppressed liver
microenvironment that is permissive for transformation of old hepatocytes. By antagonizing this
immunosuppressive signaling pathway, we hypothesize that several different types of intervention can prevent
liver cancer during aging. Completion of these Specific Aims will promote novel interventions to prevent HCC."," ",

 The Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (CADRC) is a collaborative effort of physicians
and investigators from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF),
MetroHealth System (MHS), University Hospitals (UH), and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center
(LSCVAMC), to foster excellence in research and facilitate discovery as an established National Institute on
Aging (NIA) funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The CADRC represents a rich clinical and research
community and an estimated 220,000 Ohioans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or AD-related
dementias (ADRD). The CADRC has 8 Cores and a Research Education Component designed to create the
foundation that will enhance the research efforts of the Northeast Ohio AD/ADRD research community, as well
as add unique value to the national Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRC) program and other
national and international research programs. The CADRC is focused on participants that will help us
understand the pathobiology of clinical and pathological heterogeneity observed in dementia including atypical
and amnestic AD, dementia with Lewy bodies, cognitively normal individuals with different levels of genetic risk
for AD, and diversity of participant populations (Clinical and Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Cores).
To support the CADRC goals, the focus will be on deep phenotyping of participants with longitudinal and
systematic cognitive, behavioral and motor characterization (Clinical Core), genetic and biofluid biomarker
collection and analysis (Biomarker Core), imaging (Neuroimaging Core), and autopsy after death
(Neuropathology Core). Results will be shared with the research community in a timely and regular manner to
allow other investigators to benefit from the CADRC efforts (Data Management and Statistics Core). In
addition, the CADRC will train the next generation of investigators utilizing a rigorous and well-designed
Research Education Component, support translation of new laboratory findings through the Translational
Therapeutics Core, and support high risk/high gain projects through the developmental program as a part of
the Administrative Core. The ultimate goals are to advance the precision medicine approach to dementia
diagnosis and treatment, support the development of early stage investigators, assist all stages of investigators
with tools for performing human-based research, and better engage underrepresented populations in
AD/ADRD research.","3078496",

The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework
(CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of
differenttypes of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in
order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and
communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network
visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to
develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body
with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas
of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE
MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect
metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across
multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the
HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to
connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources

Epigenetic clocks are widely used in geroscience but little known about their modifiability and behavior across
the lifespan. Here we use a human cellular lifespan system that recapitulates key hallmarks of human aging
(DNA methylation signatures, ccf-mtDNA, inflammation) to map individualized trajectories in the rate of
epigenetic aging among cells from healthy women and men, in response to glucocorticoid stress, and to
targeted mitochondrial dysfunction. These high-resolution longitudinal multi-system data will provide new
insights into inter-individual differences in aging trajectories, the modifiability of epigenetic clocks, and provide
causal evidence for the of mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential biological determinant of epigenetic aging.","NIA","10341144","12/22/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-19-056","5R01AG066828-03","5","R01","AG","066828","03"," ","GUO, MAX","4/15/2020 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2024 12:00:00 AM","Aging Systems and Geriatrics Study Section[ASG]"," ","14188763","PICARD, MARTIN ","Not Applicable","13","Unavailable","167204994","TYVNMW8FNQQ3","167204994","TYVNMW8FNQQ3","US","40.843076","-73.944206","1590919","NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE DBA RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR MENTAL HYGIENE, INC","NEW YORK","NY","Independent Hospitals","100321007","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2022 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2022 12:00:00 AM","866","Non-SBIR/STTR","2022","650280"," ","NIA","430777","219503"," ","There are substantial inter-individual differences in biological aging trajectories, but the origin of these
differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are
mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic
modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients
with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the
epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with
advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms
called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large
human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known
about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic
factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both
stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular
lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated
about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e.,
the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm
aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global
DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be
validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of
DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging
pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose
cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to
accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based
DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2,
p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic
age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other
aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between
epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of
cellular aging in a human system.","650280",

The incidences of liver cancer (primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) are increasing and disease outcome
is poor. Consequently, there is an urgent need for new therapies and preventive strategies. Age is a major risk
for HCC and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a chronic liver disease that encompasses a
progressive range of disorders of increasing severity and risk of HCC, from benign fatty liver (steatosis), to
inflammatory non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. Aging is accompanied by many
molecular, cellular and tissue changes that are candidate drivers of NAFLD and HCC, including the “hallmarks
of aging” that are dysregulated with age in diverse tissues and organisms; for example, changes to mitochondria,
metabolism, the epigenome, accumulation of senescent cells, inflammation and immune changes.
 Cell senescence is caused by a range of cellular stresses and characterized by an irreversible
proliferation arrest and a potent pro-inflammatory phenotype, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP). Recently, we showed that in senescent cells, mitochondria dysfunction signals to evict fragments of
chromatin from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF)) via a nucleus-to-
cytoplasmic blebbing process. CCF are sensed by the anti-viral cytoplasmic DNA sensing apparatus to activate
NFkB and the SASP. The SASP of senescent cells includes interferons, a family of cytokines involved in cell
intrinsic anti-viral mechanisms, control of cell proliferation, inflammation and adaptive immunity, and tumor
suppressive and oncogenic processes. Although SASP and acute IFN signaling have important benefits, chronic
SASP and IFN signaling can be detrimental. As a source of chronic inflammation, SASP promotes tissue aging
and disease, including liver cancer. Chronic IFN signaling can promote immunosuppression, in part by
upregulation of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1.
 Based on unpublished data, we hypothesize that accumulation of CCF in aged and/or senescent liver
hepatocytes drives chronic activation of IFN signaling, expression of IFN target genes and immune checkpoint
inhibitors, such as PD-L1. We further hypothesize that this, in turn, generates an immunosuppressed liver
microenvironment that is permissive for transformation of old hepatocytes. By antagonizing this
immunosuppressive signaling pathway, we hypothesize that several different types of intervention can prevent
liver cancer during aging. Completion of these Specific Aims will promote novel interventions to prevent HCC."," ",

for AD, and diversity of participant populations (Clinical and Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Cores).
To support the CADRC goals, the focus will be on deep phenotyping of participants with longitudinal and
systematic cognitive, behavioral and motor characterization (Clinical Core), genetic and biofluid biomarker
collection and analysis (Biomarker Core), imaging (Neuroimaging Core), and autopsy after death
(Neuropathology Core). Results will be shared with the research community in a timely and regular manner to
allow other investigators to benefit from the CADRC efforts (Data Management and Statistics Core). In
addition, the CADRC will train the next generation of investigators utilizing a rigorous and well-designed
Research Education Component, support translation of new laboratory findings through the Translational
Therapeutics Core, and support high risk/high gain projects through the developmental program as a part of
the Administrative Core. The ultimate goals are to advance the precision medicine approach to dementia
diagnosis and treatment, support the development of early stage investigators, assist all stages of investigators
with tools for performing human-based research, and better engage underrepresented populations in
AD/ADRD research.","3090243",

Cellular senescence is a bona fide tumor suppression mechanism but also a cause of cell and tissue aging.
Senescence is caused by a range of cellular stresses and characterized by an irreversible proliferation arrest
and a potent pro-inflammatory phenotype, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).
Senescence-associated proliferation arrest and SASP cooperate in tumor suppression, by arresting
proliferation of damaged pre-malignant cells and promoting immune clearance of the damaged cells. However,
over the longer term, as a source of chronic inflammation, SASP also promotes tissue aging and disease.
Consequently, there is currently much effort devoted to development of pharmacologic approaches to eliminate
senescent cells to promote healthy aging. However, these so-called senolytic drugs tend to show unwanted
toxicities. An alternative, inherently less toxic approach, is to specifically inhibit the pro-aging chronic SASP.
Evidence indicates that this can be achieved without impairing tumor suppressive senescence-associated
proliferation arrest.
Towards an understanding of SASP and targets for its inhibition, we recently showed that senescent cells shed
fragments of nuclear chromatin into the cytoplasm, so-called cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), via a
nucleus-to-cytoplasmic blebbing process. CCF initiate SASP in senescent cells, via activation of the anti-viral
cytoplasmic DNA sensing apparatus to activate NFkB and hence SASP. Preliminary data indicate that
formation of CCF is triggered by dysfunctional mitochondria which signal to the nucleus via a retrograde
mitochondrial ROS-JNK kinase-53BP1 pathway to nuclear MRE11 exonuclease, whose activity is required for
CCF formation. Accordingly, inhibitors of mitochondrial ROS, JNK, MRE11 and HDAC inhibitors (which appear
to act indirectly by improving mitochondria function) all suppress CCF and SASP. To identify additional tool
compounds to probe the mechanism of CCF formation and/or approved drugs as candidates for repurposing
as anti-SASP/pro-healthy aging interventions, we have established an automated high content screen for
inhibitors of CCF. We will screen focused collections of mechanistically well-defined small molecules and drug
repurposing libraries to identify and validate novel inhibitors of CCF and SASP. Completion of these Specific

PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Cleveland Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (CADRC) is a collaborative effort amongst
physicians and investigators from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the Cleveland Clinic Foundation
(CCF), the Metro Health System (MHS), University Hospitals (UH), and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical
Center (LSVA), to establish a National Institute on Aging (NIA) funded Alzheimer’s disease research center. The
CADRC would represent a rich clinical and research community and an estimated 220,000 Ohioans who suffer
from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Currently there is no Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in Ohio.
 The CADRC will bring together the considerable expertise from the medical and academic communities
in northeast Ohio to focus on one of the largest health care crises facing our country. The CADRC will be focused
on the increasingly recognized clinical and pathologic heterogeneity observed in AD and AD-Related Dementias
(ADRD).
 The CADRC will create an infrastructure to help speed up the research efforts of local, national and
international investigators. The CADRC will participate in the national Alzheimer’s Centers program and
contribute to the “big science” possible when centers from around the country collaborate. We will recruit subject
samples that northeast Ohio is well situated to study due to unique regional populations or studies (dementia
with Lewy bodies and rapidly progressive AD identified by the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance
Center,) or relevant to our understanding of AD and related dementias (cognitively normal older individuals, AD
and mild cognitive impairment). We will add value to the evaluation of these subject samples by adding biofluid
collection and analysis and cutting edge imaging. Special emphasis will also be placed on enrollment of minority
populations not often well-studied.
 We are quite encouraged by the collaborative spirit already demonstrated by those participating in the
CADRC planning from CWRU, CCF, MHS, UH, and LSVA and from the support we have received from the
northeast Ohio community. We believe this is a great opportunity for Ohio to contribute to the greater efforts of
the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers program and to improve the treatments for these devastating
disorders.","161000",

we will apply transformative new droplet scRNA sequencing technologies and next-­generation computational
methods and data processing pipelines to compile a whole brain cell transcriptome atlas on a massive scale
(millions of single cells and nuclei collected brainwide). This effort will generate an unprecedented inventory of
cell type composition and distribution for the mouse brain within the CCF. Second, we will generate a forebrain
neuronal atlas that will integrate detailed molecular information (to saturation) of anatomically defined
populations with high-­resolution morphological and connectivity information to provide an in-­depth picture of a
core portion of the mammalian brain. We will also generate highly specific driver lines for precise marking of cell
types and to enable adaptive methods that refine cell sampling to achieve completeness. Finally, realizing the
need for innovation in technology to enable work that is made difficult because it requires both scale and
precision, we will devote key effort to develop new integrated technological platforms that combine multiple
methods to relate neuronal connectivity with transcriptomes and cellular distribution at an unprecedented scale.

effort is unprecedented for scale and coverage, and it relies on a team of investigators with demonstrated
academic track records of innovation in technology and neurobiology, working in an environment that allows for

The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF)
for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of different
types of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to
exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The
proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific
visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate
and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data
overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps
composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC
team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata,
pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels
(whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE
Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and

This project will continue operation of the Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on the
successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal
neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP
include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities;
(ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high quality imaging data; and
(iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP
data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF builds on these accomplishments and
serves the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support
services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with
those of the HCP. To this end, we have established a help desk whose support functions include transfer of
data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for
these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for
different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A
second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These
services include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project’s behavioral data are
obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This entails coordination with data contributors to develop and
maitain mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database.
The data from each study include the acquired images and all data associated with the project’s behavioral
battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures based on existing HCP methods are executed to
generate quality metrics that are published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines are then run in order
to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database.
A third aim is to maintain the existing data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it
to include connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded under the Connectomes Related
to Human Diseases program. Together, these three aims enable the CCF to serve a central hub for
connectomics data aggregation and harmonization. The CCF’s suite of harmonization services from data
acquisition through data sharing ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The
resulting database enables the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain

epigenetic aging among cells from healthy women and men, in response to glucocorticoid stress, and to

differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are
mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic
modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients
with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the
epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with
advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms
called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large
human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known
about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic
factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both
stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular
lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated
about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e.,
the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm
aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global
DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be
validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of
DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging
pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose
cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to
accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based
DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2,
p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic
age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other
aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between
epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of
cellular aging in a human system.","668615",

Brain development is characterized by a diverse set of cell types that are born and connected into rapidly growing
complex 3D structures across time. Quantitative understanding of cell type composition and distribution in
different brain regions provides fundamental knowledge about the building blocks of the brain and serves as an
essential baseline with which to assess changes that may occur in brain disorders. The importance of this
information is reflected by the significant effort among the neuroscience community, including the creation of the
BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, to improve our understanding of cell type compositions across different
brain regions in the adult mouse brain. These efforts have been made possible and accelerated by technological
advances in high-resolution 3D imaging coupled with computational analysis methods that can reveal cell type
arrangement in the brain with unprecedented detail. For example, we developed a quantitative brain mapping
method to uncover the spatial arrangement of GABAergic neuron subtypes in the adult mouse brain. For the
adult mouse brain, the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) currently serves as the standard atlas
resource with which to map and integrate results from different studies. The neuroscience community, on the
other hand, does not have similar CCFs for the developing mouse brain. The lack of developmental CCFs
significantly hinders progress on cell type mapping of the developing mouse brain by limiting the reproducibility
and integration of data from different studies. To address this deficiency, we have assembled a highly synergistic,
multi-institutional team with complementary skill sets to create developmental CCFs with associated ontology
and true 3D anatomical labels while also demonstrating the application of our CCFs by generating quantitative
mappings of GABAergic neurons in the developing mouse brain. Toward this end, we will first utilize MRI and
light sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) to develop high-resolution developmental CCFs at seven different
developmental time points (E11.5, E13.5, E15.5, E18.5, P4, P14, and P56) with different cellular features,
including total cell density, myelination, and neurovasculature. Second, we will create true 3D anatomical labels
for the CCFs based on cellular and gene expression information, and build a comprehensive ontology that will
allow anatomical region changes to be linked across development and maturation. Lastly, we will generate a
cellular-resolution quantitative map of GABAergic neuronal subtypes using tissue clearing and LSFM imaging in
developing mouse brains, which will serve as a substantial data resource to accelerate developmental
neuroscience discovery. The successful completion of this project will enable a broad field of scientists to
leverage modern brain mapping technologies more effectively in studying the developing mouse brain.","3797901",

Cellular senescence is a bona fide tumor suppression mechanism but also a cause of cell and tissue aging.
Senescence is caused by a range of cellular stresses and characterized by an irreversible proliferation arrest
and a potent pro-inflammatory phenotype, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).
Senescence-associated proliferation arrest and SASP cooperate in tumor suppression, by arresting
proliferation of damaged pre-malignant cells and promoting immune clearance of the damaged cells. However,
over the longer term, as a source of chronic inflammation, SASP also promotes tissue aging and disease.
Consequently, there is currently much effort devoted to development of pharmacologic approaches to eliminate
senescent cells to promote healthy aging. However, these so-called senolytic drugs tend to show unwanted
toxicities. An alternative, inherently less toxic approach, is to specifically inhibit the pro-aging chronic SASP.
Evidence indicates that this can be achieved without impairing tumor suppressive senescence-associated
proliferation arrest.
Towards an understanding of SASP and targets for its inhibition, we recently showed that senescent cells shed
fragments of nuclear chromatin into the cytoplasm, so-called cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF), via a
nucleus-to-cytoplasmic blebbing process. CCF initiate SASP in senescent cells, via activation of the anti-viral
cytoplasmic DNA sensing apparatus to activate NFkB and hence SASP. Preliminary data indicate that
formation of CCF is triggered by dysfunctional mitochondria which signal to the nucleus via a retrograde
mitochondrial ROS-JNK kinase-53BP1 pathway to nuclear MRE11 exonuclease, whose activity is required for
CCF formation. Accordingly, inhibitors of mitochondrial ROS, JNK, MRE11 and HDAC inhibitors (which appear
to act indirectly by improving mitochondria function) all suppress CCF and SASP. To identify additional tool
compounds to probe the mechanism of CCF formation and/or approved drugs as candidates for repurposing
as anti-SASP/pro-healthy aging interventions, we have established an automated high content screen for
inhibitors of CCF. We will screen focused collections of mechanistically well-defined small molecules and drug
repurposing libraries to identify and validate novel inhibitors of CCF and SASP. Completion of these Specific
Aims will identify valuable tool compounds for further mechanistic investigation of CCF and SASP, and also

The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the
healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func-
tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order
to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in
support of data exploration and communication.
The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization,
mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen-
sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored
online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect
metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body
along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and
integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or
“position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup-
porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body.
In the first year, the proposed Mapping Component will run user needs analyses, compile an initial CCF using
pre-existing classifications and ontologies; implement two interactive data visualizations; and evaluate the usa-
bility and effectiveness of the CCF and associated visualizations in formal user studies.","49496",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The Cleveland Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (CADRC) is a collaborative effort amongst physicians
and investigators from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) –
both in Cleveland, Ohio and Las Vegas, Nevada, Metro Health Systems (MHS), University Hospitals (UH), and
the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center (LSVA) to establish an National Institute on Aging/National
Institute of Health Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in northeast Ohio and in Nevada. The purpose of the
CADRC is to improve our understanding of why Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease related
dementias (ADRD) vary from person to person. The CADRC will create an infrastructure to help speed up the
research efforts of local, national and international investigators. It is anticipated that the establishment of such
a center will advance research into AD/ADRD and ultimately improve the lives of those affected by these
devastating disease.","NIA","9967961","7/20/2020 12:00:00 AM","RFA-AG-19-001","5P30AG062428-02","5","P30","AG","062428","02"," ","SILVERBERG, NINA B","7/1/2019 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2023 12:00:00 AM","ZAG1-ZIJ-G(J1)"," ","1905365","LEVERENZ, JAMES BRUCE","Not Applicable","11","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","135781701","M5QFLTCTSQN6","135781701","M5QFLTCTSQN6","US","41.502657","-81.622127","10000858","CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU","CLEVELAND","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","441950001","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2020 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2023 12:00:00 AM","866","Research Centers","2020","2115312"," ","NIA","1873725","914334"," ","OVERALL
PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Cleveland Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (CADRC) is a collaborative effort amongst
physicians and investigators from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the Cleveland Clinic Foundation
(CCF), Cleveland Ohio and Las Vegas, Nevada sites, the Metro Health System (MHS), University Hospitals
(UH), and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center (LSVA), to establish a National Institute on Aging
(NIA) funded Alzheimer’s disease research center. The CADRC would represent a rich clinical and research
community and an estimated 45,000 Nevadans and 220,000 Ohioans who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Currently there is no Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in either Ohio or Nevada.
 The CADRC will bring together the considerable expertise from the medical and academic communities
in northeast Ohio and Nevada to focus on one of the largest health care crises facing our country. The CADRC
will be focused on the increasingly recognized clinical and pathologic heterogeneity observed in AD and AD-
Related Dementias (ADRD).
 The CADRC will create an infrastructure to help speed up the research efforts of local, national and
international investigators. The CADRC will participate in the national Alzheimer’s Centers program and
contribute to the “big science” possible when centers from around the country collaborate. We will recruit
subject samples that northeast Ohio and Nevada are well situated to study due to unique regional populations
or studies (dementia with Lewy bodies, repetitive head trauma, and rapidly progressive AD identified by the
National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center,) or relevant to our understanding of AD and related
dementias (cognitively normal older individuals, AD and mild cognitive impairment). We will add value to the
evaluation of these subject samples by adding biofluid collection and analysis and cutting edge imaging.
Special emphasis will also be placed on enrollment of minority populations not often well-studied.
 We are quite encouraged by the collaborative spirit already demonstrated by those participating in the
CADRC planning from CWRU, CCF, MHS, UH, and LSVA and from the support we have received from the
northeast Ohio and Las Vegas communities. We believe this is a great opportunity for both Ohio and Nevada
to contribute to the greater efforts of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers program and to improve the
treatments for these devastating disorders.","2115312",

This project will continue operation of the Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on the
successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal
neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP
include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities;
(ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high quality imaging data; and
(iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP
data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF builds on these accomplishments and
serves the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support
services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with
those of the HCP. To this end, we have established a help desk whose support functions include transfer of
data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for
these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for
different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A
second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These
services include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project’s behavioral data are
obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This entails coordination with data contributors to develop and
maitain mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database.
The data from each study include the acquired images and all data associated with the project’s behavioral
battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures based on existing HCP methods are executed to
generate quality metrics that are published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines are then run in order
to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database.
A third aim is to maintain the existing data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it
to include connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded under the Connectomes Related
to Human Diseases program. Together, these three aims enable the CCF to serve a central hub for
connectomics data aggregation and harmonization. The CCF’s suite of harmonization services from data
acquisition through data sharing ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The
resulting database enables the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain
function in health and disease.","354218",

Epigenetic clocks are widely used in geroscience but little known about their modifiability and behavior across
the lifespan. Here we use a human cellular lifespan system that recapitulates key hallmarks of human aging
(DNA methylation signatures, ccf-mtDNA, inflammation) to map individualized trajectories in the rate of
epigenetic aging among cells from healthy women and men, in response to glucocorticoid stress, and to
targeted mitochondrial dysfunction. These high-resolution longitudinal multi-system data will provide new
insights into inter-individual differences in aging trajectories, the modifiability of epigenetic clocks, and provide
causal evidence for the of mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential biological determinant of epigenetic aging.","NIA","9945660","4/2/2020 12:00:00 AM","PA-19-056","1R01AG066828-01","1","R01","AG","066828","01"," ","GUO, MAX","4/15/2020 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2024 12:00:00 AM","Aging Systems and Geriatrics Study Section[ASG]"," ","14188763","PICARD, MARTIN ","Not Applicable","13","Unavailable","167204994","TYVNMW8FNQQ3","167204994","TYVNMW8FNQQ3","US","40.843076","-73.944206","1590919","NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE DBA RESEARCH FOUNDATION FOR MENTAL HYGIENE, INC","NEW YORK","NY","Independent Hospitals","100321007","UNITED STATES","N","4/15/2020 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2020 12:00:00 AM","866","Non-SBIR/STTR","2020","646852"," ","NIA","416117","230735"," ","There are substantial inter-individual differences in biological aging trajectories, but the origin of these
differences is unclear. One specific cellular component that sustains life and fuels stress adaptation are
mitochondria, which contain their own genome and generate metabolic intermediates necessary for epigenetic
modifications. As a result, genetic defects in mitochondria shorten lifespan in both animal models and patients
with mtDNA defects, possibly via the influence of mitochondrial signaling on gene expression and the
epigenetic machinery, which includes DNA methylation (DNAm). Reliable changes in DNAm occur with
advancing age at specific genomic locations, which have been captured and integrated in predictive algorithms
called epigenetic clocks. These clocks predict DNAmAge and have been validated and meta-analyzed in large
human cohorts demonstrating that DNAmAge predicts mortality and age-related diseases. But little is known
about what clocks actually measure (i.e., what makes them tick), and about their modifiability by metabolic
factors across the lifespan. To map the life-long behavior of epigenetic clocks and their responses to both
stress mediators and mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a primary human fibroblasts cellular
lifespan model where: i) DNAm signatures of aging are conserved, ii) the rate of DNAm aging is accelerated
about 70 times relative to the human body, iii) metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction reduces lifespan (i.e.,
the Hayflick limit) by 25-50%, and iv) other aging biomarkers including ccf-mtDNA and the pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL6 are also progressively induced across the cellular lifespan. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNAm
aging trajectories across the entire cellular lifespan in both female and male cells using four different global
DNAmAge algorithms, a gene-based approach, and by modeling single-CpG trajectories. There results will be
validated and extended into available human aging cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine the modifiability of
DNAm clocks with two interventions that reliably decrease the Hayflick limit: i) we will use converging
pharmacological and genetic approaches to induce specific mitochondrial respiratory defects, and ii) expose
cells to chronic glucocorticoid stimulation to recapitulate the effects of chronic psychosocial stress known to
accelerate biological aging in humans. In the final aim, we will perform studies to understand how clock-based
DNAmAge relate to other validated aging biomarkers including the expression of age-related genes (Elovl2,
p16INK4a), telomere length, circulating cell-free mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA), and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6.
Moreover, additional experiments will be performed to establish the contribution of cell division to epigenetic
age acceleration, the role of ambient oxygen, and to test the effect of a DNA demethylation agent on other
aging biomarkers and on lifespan. Overall, these studies will uncover novel longitudinal associations between
epigenetic clocks and human aging biomarkers, and establish the role of mitochondrial signaling as a driver of
cellular aging in a human system.","646852",

The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF)
for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of different
types of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to
exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The
proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific
visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate
and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data
overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps
composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC
team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata,
pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels
(whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE
Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and
integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by
spatial context.","600000",

PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Cleveland Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (CADRC) is a collaborative effort amongst
physicians and investigators from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), the Cleveland Clinic Foundation
(CCF), Cleveland Ohio and Las Vegas, Nevada sites, the Metro Health System (MHS), University Hospitals
(UH), and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center (LSVA), to establish a National Institute on Aging
(NIA) funded Alzheimer’s disease research center. The CADRC would represent a rich clinical and research
community and an estimated 45,000 Nevadans and 220,000 Ohioans who suffer from Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Currently there is no Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in either Ohio or Nevada.
 The CADRC will bring together the considerable expertise from the medical and academic communities
in northeast Ohio and Nevada to focus on one of the largest health care crises facing our country. The CADRC
will be focused on the increasingly recognized clinical and pathologic heterogeneity observed in AD and AD-
Related Dementias (ADRD).
 The CADRC will create an infrastructure to help speed up the research efforts of local, national and
international investigators. The CADRC will participate in the national Alzheimer’s Centers program and
contribute to the “big science” possible when centers from around the country collaborate. We will recruit
subject samples that northeast Ohio and Nevada are well situated to study due to unique regional populations
or studies (dementia with Lewy bodies, repetitive head trauma, and rapidly progressive AD identified by the
National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center,) or relevant to our understanding of AD and related
dementias (cognitively normal older individuals, AD and mild cognitive impairment). We will add value to the
evaluation of these subject samples by adding biofluid collection and analysis and cutting edge imaging.
Special emphasis will also be placed on enrollment of minority populations not often well-studied.
 We are quite encouraged by the collaborative spirit already demonstrated by those participating in the
CADRC planning from CWRU, CCF, MHS, UH, and LSVA and from the support we have received from the
northeast Ohio and Las Vegas communities. We believe this is a great opportunity for both Ohio and Nevada
to contribute to the greater efforts of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers program and to improve the
treatments for these devastating disorders.","2117487",

The ultimate goal of the HIVE Mapping effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the
healthy human body that supports the cataloguing of different types of individual cells, understanding the func-
tion and relationships between those cell types, and modeling their individual and collective function. In order
to exploit human and machine intelligence, different visual interfaces will be implemented that use the CCF in
support of data exploration and communication.
The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization,
mathematical biology, and biomedical data standards to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimen-
sional spatial basemap of the human body and associated data overlays that can be interactively explored
online as an atlas of tissue maps. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect
metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across the human body
along multiple functional contexts (e.g., systems physiology, vascular, or endocrine systems), and connect and
integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources as driven by the context or
“position” on the map. The CCF and the interactive data visualizations will be multi-level and multi-scale sup-
porting the exploration and communication of tissue and publication data--from single cell to whole body.
In the first year, the proposed Mapping Component will run user needs analyses, compile an initial CCF using
pre-existing classifications and ontologies; implement two interactive data visualizations; and evaluate the usa-
bility and effectiveness of the CCF and associated visualizations in formal user studies.","330000",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will establish a Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on recent successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which has acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities; (ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high
quality imaging data; and (iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF will build on these accomplishments and serve the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with those of the HCP. The effort will establish a help desk whose support functions will include transfer of data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These services will include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project's behavioral data are obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This will entail coordination with data contributors to develop mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database. The data from each study will include the unprocessed images, minimally preprocessed data generated by each project's internal pipelines, and all data associated with the project's behavioral battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures will be implemented based on existing HCP methods to generate quality metrics that will be published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines will be run in order to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database. A third aim is to maintain the existing ConnectomeDB data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it to include Connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded as U01 projects under the Connectomes Related to Human Diseases RFA. The platform will be developed and operated following policies and procedures vetted by the HCP to ensure the privacy and security of the data hosted by the CCF. Together, these three aims will establish the CCF as a central hub for connectomics data aggregation and sharing. The CCF's suite of harmonization services from data acquisition through data sharing will ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The resulting database will enable the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain function in health and disease.","226560",

The  BRAIN  initiative  cell  census  network  calls  for  large-­scale,  comprehensive  approaches  to  define  the 
composition of the mammalian brain at the cellular level and using an overall strategy that integrates multimodal 
information  (morphology,  connectivity,  molecules  etc..)  within  a  Common  Coordinated  Framework  (CCF)  to 
enable  distribution,  validation,  integration  and  use  of  the  atlas  by  the  community.  The  BICCN  challenge  is 
enormous and remains a scientific problem requiring new discovery, continuous innovation in methods, 
technologies and pipeline of analysis. Given the unparalleled cellular diversity of the mouse brain and the 
need for an informed cell classification scheme, we propose here an ambitious project that addresses both the 
need  for  scale  (coverage  of  millions  of  cells)  and  depth  of  analysis  of  each  cell  and,  further,  that  integrates 
molecular and anatomical information. To address this challenge, we have assembled a collaborative group of 
key knowledge leaders and innovators across various fields of neuroscience, genomics, and technology. First, 
we  will  apply  transformative  new  droplet  scRNA  sequencing  technologies  and  next-­generation  computational 
methods and data processing pipelines to compile a whole brain cell transcriptome atlas on a massive scale 
(millions of single cells and nuclei collected brainwide). This effort will generate an unprecedented inventory of 
cell type composition and distribution for the mouse brain within the CCF. Second, we will generate a forebrain 
neuronal  atlas  that  will  integrate  detailed  molecular  information  (to  saturation)  of  anatomically  defined 
populations with high-­resolution morphological and connectivity information to provide an in-­depth picture of a 
core portion of the mammalian brain. We will also generate highly specific driver lines for precise marking of cell 
types and to enable adaptive methods that refine cell sampling to achieve completeness. Finally, realizing the 
need  for  innovation  in  technology  to  enable  work  that  is  made  difficult  because  it  requires  both  scale  and 
precision,  we  will  devote  key  effort  to  develop  new  integrated  technological  platforms  that  combine  multiple 
methods to relate neuronal connectivity with transcriptomes and cellular distribution at an unprecedented scale. 
Our  Data  Core  will  integrate,  store,  and  manage  multi-­modal  datasets  and  provide  bioinformatics  and 
computational expertise;; and our Administrative Core, will coordinate and oversee Center-­wide activities. Our 
effort  is  unprecedented  for  scale  and  coverage,  and  it  relies  on  a  team  of  investigators  with  demonstrated 
academic track records of innovation in technology and neurobiology, working in an environment that allows for 
implementation  of  massive  pipelines  for  production  workflow.  This  will  guarantee  progressive  evolution  and 
innovation of methods, experimental design and analysis to meet future challenges and succeed at generating 
a comprehensive molecular and anatomical atlas of the mouse brain.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will establish a Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on recent successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which has acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities; (ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high
quality imaging data; and (iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF will build on these accomplishments and serve the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with those of the HCP. The effort will establish a help desk whose support functions will include transfer of data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These services will include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project's behavioral data are obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This will entail coordination with data contributors to develop mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database. The data from each study will include the unprocessed images, minimally preprocessed data generated by each project's internal pipelines, and all data associated with the project's behavioral battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures will be implemented based on existing HCP methods to generate quality metrics that will be published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines will be run in order to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database. A third aim is to maintain the existing ConnectomeDB data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it to include Connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded as U01 projects under the Connectomes Related to Human Diseases RFA. The platform will be developed and operated following policies and procedures vetted by the HCP to ensure the privacy and security of the data hosted by the CCF. Together, these three aims will establish the CCF as a central hub for connectomics data aggregation and sharing. The CCF's suite of harmonization services from data acquisition through data sharing will ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The resulting database will enable the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain function in health and disease.","264960",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will establish a Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on recent successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which has acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities; (ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high
quality imaging data; and (iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF will build on these accomplishments and serve the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with those of the HCP. The effort will establish a help desk whose support functions will include transfer of data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These services will include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project's behavioral data are obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This will entail coordination with data contributors to develop mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database. The data from each study will include the unprocessed images, minimally preprocessed data generated by each project's internal pipelines, and all data associated with the project's behavioral battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures will be implemented based on existing HCP methods to generate quality metrics that will be published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines will be run in order to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database. A third aim is to maintain the existing ConnectomeDB data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it to include Connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded as U01 projects under the Connectomes Related to Human Diseases RFA. The platform will be developed and operated following policies and procedures vetted by the HCP to ensure the privacy and security of the data hosted by the CCF. Together, these three aims will establish the CCF as a central hub for connectomics data aggregation and sharing. The CCF's suite of harmonization services from data acquisition through data sharing will ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The resulting database will enable the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain function in health and disease.","64800",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will establish a Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) by capitalizing on recent successes of the Human Connectome Project (HCP), which has acquired, analyzed, and shared multimodal neuroimaging data and behavioral data on a large population of healthy adults. Major advances by the HCP include (i) the establishment of data acquisition protocols that yield high quality data across multiple modalities; (ii) the implementation of preprocessing pipelines that take full advantage of the high
quality imaging data; and (iii) the establishment of a robust informatics infrastructure that has allowed widespread sharing of the HCP data within the neuroimaging and neuroscience communities. The CCF will build on these accomplishments and serve the human neuroimaging community in three ways. One aim is to provide consultation and support services to the research community for the primary purpose of harmonizing image acquisition protocols with those of the HCP. The effort will establish a help desk whose support functions will include transfer of data acquisition sequences and image reconstruction algorithms; providing updates and improvements for these sequences and algorithms; harmonization of imaging protocols and image reconstruction support for different software platforms and versions; and consultation for potential problems (e.g. image artifacts). A second aim is to provide services that maximize comparability of data acquired by CCF contributors. These services will include pre-data acquisition guidance to contributors to ensure that each project's behavioral data are obtained using HCP-compatible methods. This will entail coordination with data contributors to develop mechanisms to streamline transfers of de-identified data from the study sites to the CCF database. The data from each study will include the unprocessed images, minimally preprocessed data generated by each project's internal pipelines, and all data associated with the project's behavioral battery. Manual and automated quality control procedures will be implemented based on existing HCP methods to generate quality metrics that will be published with the data. A standardized set of pipelines will be run in order to produce minimally preprocessed data that is fully harmonized with the other data sets in the CCF database. A third aim is to maintain the existing ConnectomeDB data repository infrastructure for Human Connectome Data and expand it to include Connectome data from other research laboratories that are funded as U01 projects under the Connectomes Related to Human Diseases RFA. The platform will be developed and operated following policies and procedures vetted by the HCP to ensure the privacy and security of the data hosted by the CCF. Together, these three aims will establish the CCF as a central hub for connectomics data aggregation and sharing. The CCF's suite of harmonization services from data acquisition through data sharing will ensure an unprecedented level of compatibility across data sets. The resulting database will enable the scientific community to conduct novel analyses to better understand brain function in health and disease.","728715",

Cell culture technology plays an essential role in modern cancer research. The Cell Culture Facility (CCF) serves as a customized pay-for-service Facility that provides expertise, technical support, reagents, equipment, liquid nitrogen storage, and training to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of using mammalian cell culture in Fox Chase Cancer Center (FCCC) laboratories. This Facility provides technical assistance and consultation services in tissue culture techniques, centralized liquid nitrogen banking, 
mycoplasma screening services, the preparation of custom and standard culture media and supplements, performance testing of fetal bovine serum, cell propagation, and technical support and supplies for mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell transfection and culture. Major efforts by the CCF include carrying out technically challenging techniques, such as the establishment of primary cell cultures from patient or animal tissue 
samples, hybridoma fusion and cloning services to generate monoclonal antibodies, and establishing gene ""knockout"" or ""knock-in"" Embryonic Stem (ES) cells to generate genetically manipulated mice. Since the last review the Center established a governing body for the CCSG supported Shared Resources called the Facility Parent Oversight Committee (FPOC). The FPOC recommended in 2008 that the CCF incorporate 
the Hybridoma Facility, which was previously approved as a distinct CCSG Facility. This merger has provided operational efficiencies by centrally locating the merged staff. Economic efficiencies have been achieved by reducing total staff by 2.05 FTE, and by presenting a reduced overall request from the CCSG. 
The merged CCSG budget request is $19,724 less than the combined levels approved for previously two distinct cores at the last review. In 2009, the Facility served 47 investigators with peer-reviewed funding. 
Service was provided to all five of the Center's CCSG Research Programs. Peer-reviewed, funded research accounted for 95.3% of CCF usage in calendar year 2009. Based on an annual quality survey administered by the FPOC, the Facility is highly regarded among faculty users, and received an ""Outstanding to Excellent"" 
rating at the last CCSG review. In the past five years, the demand for CCF services has remained strong. 
Importantly, the Facility supplies the FCCC community with valuable on-site expertise for a host of established cell culture protocols, consultation in the design and evaluation of experiments, training in cell culture methodologies, high quality culture media and supplements, and adaptable assistance delivered in a cost-effective manner."," ",

 Free Radicals and Methamphetamine Abuse
 We will investigate the action of methamphetamine (Meth) on oxidative metabolism, directly on
macrophages, and on other cell types in vitro, as well as in vivo in conditions of co-morbid factor interaction.
The hypothesis behind this proposal is that Meth affects the intensity and quality of the oxidative burst by
acting directly on macrophages and/or glial cells, in addition to its action on neurons, contributing to the
development of pathology mediated by oxidative stress, not only in the Central Nervous System, but also in
peripheral organs. Initially, we will focus on the effect of meth on various human and mouse macrophage
(THP1, RAW264.7), microglia (MG5, EOC 2), astrocyte (C8-D1A, CCF-STTG1), and neuronal (SH-SY5Y, SK-
N-MC) cell lines, regarding the production of O2_, H2O2, and other reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), as
well as Reactive Nitrogen Intermediates (RNI) using various chromogenic methods. Mitochondria activity upon
interaction with meth will be also addressed on cells stimulated with Meth. Following a characterization of the
different cell lines regarding production of free radicals and mitochondrial changes in reaction to Meth, we will
choose good responders to investigate transcriptional changes on molecules within ROI and RNI pathways,
caused by action of Meth. For that we will use multiplex technology, as well as enzymatic checkpoint inhibition
strategies. These approaches will help dissect the molecular basis of respiratory burst induction by Meth, and
will distinguish whether Meth interferes over mitochodria, peroxisome, or both. Following the in vitro approach
using cell lines, we intend to validate findings in the context of pathology. We will use cryopreserved cells and
tissues from monkeys infected with SIV (as a model for HIV infection, a common co-morbid condition)
subjected to a Meth treatment schedule. We will identify transcriptionally altered oxidative pathways on
cryopreserved brain and peripheral tissues derived from SIV-infected Meth-treated monkeys by qRT-PCR. This
brings relevance to pathology in humans.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methamphetamine is one of the most growing drugs of abuse, causing neurological impairments, and associated with behaviors that favor exposure to HIV, a virus that penetrates the CNS leading to neuroAIDS. Meth users infected with HIV usually present a more severe form of neuroAIDS, due to effects on neurons. IT is known that free radicals participate in the enhancement of brain pathology, but the cell types as well as pathways affected by Meth that lead to free-radical mediated stress. The hypothesis behind this proposal is that Meth interacts with cell types other than neurons will be explored, particularly regarding its potential to induce and/or modulate reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. We will investigate the action of methamphetamine (Meth) on oxidative metabolism, directly on macrophages, and on other cell types in vitro, as well as in vivo, in conditions of co-morbid factor interaction. For that we will examine the action of Meth on cell lines, by investigating how the drug affects the intensity and quality of the oxidative burst, and searching for genes within ROI and RNI pathways that exhibit transcriptional pattern changes upon Meth exposure. Such transcriptional changes will be validated by looking for similar changes in cells obtained from Meth-treated animals infected with SIV, which have been previously characterized for CNS disease parameters. The results from this project will offer important clues on the participation of Meth in pathology mediated by oxidative stress by acting on ROI and RNI induction pathways, not only in the Central Nervous System, but also in peripheral organs.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will investigate the action of methamphetamine (Meth) on oxidative metabolism, directly on macrophages, and on other cell types in vitro, as well as in vivo in conditions of co-morbid factor interaction. The hypothesis behind this proposal is that Meth affects the intensity and quality of the oxidative burst by acting directly on macrophages and/or glial cells, in addition to its action on neurons, contributing to the development of pathology mediated by oxidative stress, not only in the Central Nervous System, but also in peripheral organs. Initially, we will focus on the effect of meth on various human and mouse macrophage (THP1, RAW264.7), microglia (MG5, EOC 2), astrocyte (C8-D1A, CCF-STTG1), and neuronal (SH-SY5Y, SK- N-MC) cell lines, regarding the production of O2_, H2O2, and other reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), as well as Reactive Nitrogen Intermediates (RNI) using various chromogenic methods. Mitochondria activity upon interaction with meth will be also addressed on cells stimulated with Meth. Following a characterization of the different cell lines regarding production of free radicals and mitochondrial changes in reaction to Meth, we will choose good responders to investigate transcriptional changes on molecules within ROI and RNI pathways, caused by action of Meth. For that we will use multiplex technology, as well as enzymatic checkpoint inhibition strategies. These approaches will help dissect the molecular basis of respiratory burst induction by Meth, and will distinguish whether Meth interferes over mitochodria, peroxisome, or both. Following the in vitro approach using cell lines, we intend to validate findings in the context of pathology. We will use cryopreserved cells and tissues from monkeys infected with SIV (as a model for HIV infection, a common co-morbid condition) subjected to a Meth treatment schedule. We will identify transcriptionally altered oxidative pathways on cryopreserved brain and peripheral tissues derived from SIV-infected Meth-treated monkeys by qRT-PCR.

Heart failure is a serious and common disease with significant mortality and morbidity. Breathing disorders during sleep adversely affect outcomes in heart failure patients. These breathing disorders include Cheyne-Stokes Respiration (CSR) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). A small study in 1959 found that changing from the sitting to the supine position caused or aggravated CSR in a small number of awake patients with heart failure. We have observed the same phenomena in a sleeping patient in our laboratory.
  We propose to study a large group of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than or equal to 35% to see if changing the sleeping position from reclining to supine causes or aggravates CSR. We will also monitor non-invasively their cardiac hemodynamics at these different sleeping postures to document changes in thoracic fluid content and cardiac performance.
  Our patients will be selected from those referred to Queen¿s Medical Center for echocardiography with a diagnosis of CHF, and with a LVEF of less than or equal to 35%. If the patient consents, nurses will screen them for exclusion criteria, record demographics, general medical, cardiac and sleep histories. A comprehensive chemistry panel, electrocardiogram and simple spirometry will be obtained. The patient¿s database will be reviewed and validated and a heart and lung examination will be performed by the Principal Investigator. The patient will then be referred to the Queen¿s Sleep laboratory. An overnight polysomnogram (PSG) will be performed with non-invasive impedence cardiography monitoring. Standard PSG parameters, transcutaneous pCO2, together with measures of thoracic fluid content and cardiac performance will be recorded."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
The Cleveland Clinic Foundation Musculoskeletal Core Center (CCFMCC). In the years since the original RFA for MCCs, musculoskeletal research activities have dramatically increased at CCF by the recruitment of Dr. Joseph Lannotti (an outstanding clinical musculoskeletal researcher) to the Chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, by the recruitment of Dr. Peter Cavanagh (an outstanding musculoskeletal biomechanics researcher) to the Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, by the creation of the Orthopaedic Research Center in these two Departments, and by the recruitment of 3 new investigators into the Center. This, combined with an already strong musculoskeletal program, now provides a broadly based, interactive and well-funded Research Base for our proposed CCFMCC. Investigators in the Research Base currently are PIs on 14 NIH R01 grants, 9 of them funded by NIAMS. This clearly demonstrates the commitment of the CCF and NIH to this research. The ORC is committed to collaboration in translational research and enrichment programs. An example is the monthly Musculoskeletal Research Seminar Series that extends to Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals Research Institute and NE Ohio Universities College of Medicine to generate synergistic research in the wider NE Ohio area. We ask, in this proposal, for funds to invite 4 national/international musculoskeletal researchers a year to enrich this already established activity. The CCFMCC would also enrich the research of the Center and CCF with 3 proposed cores: Musculoskeletal Imaging, Musculoskeletal Histology, and Musculoskeletal Robotics and Mechanical Testing, each with highly skilled Directors and Associate Directors. The imaging core was rated outstanding in our first submission and has added significantly to its resources, including microCT capabilities. The expansion of the Research Base has greatly increased the need for histology of soft and mineralized tissues and for in situ hybridization. The histology core would meet this need with high throughput, reproducible methods, particularly for tissue arrays, tissue sections and highly sensitive, non-radioactive in situ hybridization. Dr. Cavanagh has established a robotics system that, with our existing materials testing capabilities, forms the biomechanics core, adding a new and exciting dimension to investigations in the Research Base. An External Advisory Board of 5 outstanding musculoskeletal researchers has been assembled to review the Pilot and Feasibility Projects and for evaluating their progress on a yearly basis. Their stringent review of the 6 Projects prepared from the 13 originally proposed has led to the 2 that are incorporated into this application. In sum, we feel that we have all the necessary attributes to provide a highly competitive application for a MCC that would enhance our research in ways that can make a difference and contribute more significantly to musculoskeletal research.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
The Cleveland Clinic Foundation Musculoskeletal Core Center (CCFMCC). In the years since the original RFA for MCCs, musculoskeletal research activities have dramatically increased at CCF by the recruitment of Dr. Joseph Iannotti (an outstanding clinical musculoskeletal researcher) to the Chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, by the recruitment of Dr. Peter Cavanagh (an outstanding musculoskeletal biomechanics researcher) to the Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering, by the creation of the Orthopaedic Research Center in these two Departments, and by the recruitment of 3 new investigators into the Center. This, combined with an already strong musculoskeletal program, now provides a broadly based, interactive and well-funded Research Base for our proposed CCFMCC. Investigators in the Research Base currently are PIs on 14 NIH R01 grants, 9 of them funded by NIAMS. This clearly demonstrates the commitment of the CCF and NIH to this research. The ORC is committed to collaboration in translational research and enrichment programs. An example is the monthly Musculoskeletal Research Seminar Series that extends to Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals Research Institute and NE Ohio Universities College of Medicine to generate synergistic research in the wider NE Ohio area. We ask, in this proposal, for funds to invite 4 national/international musculoskeletal researchers a year to enrich this already established activity. The CCFMCC would also enrich the research of the Center and CCF with 3 proposed cores: Musculoskeletal Imaging, Musculoskeletal Histology, and Musculoskeletal Robotics and Mechanical Testing, each with highly skilled Directors and Associate Directors. The imaging core was rated outstanding in our first submission and has added significantly to its resources, including microCT capabilities. The expansion of the Research Base has greatly increased the need for histology of soft and mineralized tissues and for in situ hybridization. The histology core would meet this need with high throughput, reproducible methods, particularly for tissue arrays, tissue sections and highly sensitive, non-radioactive in situ hybridization. Dr. Cavanagh has established a robotics system that, with our existing materials testing capabilities, forms the biomechanics core, adding a new and exciting dimension to investigations in the Research Base. An External Advisory Board of 5 outstanding musculoskeletal researchers has been assembled to review the Pilot and Feasibility Projects and for evaluating their progress on a yearly basis. Their stringent review of the 6 Projects prepared from the 13 originally proposed has led to the 2 that are incorporated into this application. In sum, we feel that we have all the necessary attributes to provide a highly competitive application for a MCC that would enhance our research in ways that can make a difference and contribute more significantly to musculoskeletal research.
