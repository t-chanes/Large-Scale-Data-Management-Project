The study of traversable wormhole configurations that involve a direct connection between the two ends of the wormhole and the implications for quantum information in gravity as well as the study of quantum entanglement and relation to quantum teleportation. Qubit models that exhibit the physics of teleportation through the wormhole in the dual gravitational description, include the specific features associated to causal travel of the qubit through the wormhole will be investigated. 2. The investigation of applications of quantum algorithms, technologies, and simulations on challenging areas in High Energy Physics and perform benchmarking and validation. Major goals of this thrust include quantum-assisted tracking, vertexing, and particle-based reconstruction algorithms and methods, and real-time decision making and inference algorithms."
