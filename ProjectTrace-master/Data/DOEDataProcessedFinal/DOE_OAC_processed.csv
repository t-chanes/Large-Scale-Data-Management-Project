Symmetry in Correlated Quantum Matter,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0014415,"Hermele, Michael",Michael.Hermele@theregentsoftheuniversityofcoloradod/b/auniversityofcolorado,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Symmetry in Correlated Quantum Matter Michael Hermele, University of Colorado Boulder (Principal Investigator) The goals of this project are to characterize, classify and elucidate the properties of highly entangled forms of quantum matter. Beginning with the discovery of fractional quantum Hall liquids, it has gradually become clear that many-body quantum entanglement is a crucial ingredient in a wide range of quantum phases of matter, which are still in the process of being understood. These developments have been coupled with recent advances in quantum materials and new platforms for synthetic quantum matter, which provide access to new parameter regimes and raise the prospects for engineering new states of highly entangled matter. The project research is divided into two topics. The first topic focuses on fracton phases of matter, defined by the presence of excitations whose mobility is restricted to points, lines and planes, and which are of interest in part as a new and still poorly-understood class of quantum phases of matter. Many of the most basic theoretical questions about fracton phases remain open. Closely related to fracton phases is a novel class of symmetries known as subsystem symmetries, which can result in fracton-like phenomena that also fall under this topic. The second topic is the physics of correlated spin-orbit quantum materials, which combine significant electron-electron interaction with strong spin-orbit coupling, including especially 4f and 5d magnetic systems. Strong spin-orbit coupling provides access to novel parameter regimes, while at the same time heightening the importance of developing effective models that are well-grounded in the microscopic physics of a given material. Work on fractons is focused both on developing the general theory of fracton phases, and on identifying physically simpler models that can bring fracton physics into closer contact with work on correlated materials and synthetic quantum matter platforms. Symmetry-based searches for new fracton models will be carried out, some of which may be realistic for f-electron magnetic insulators. Phenomena related to subsystem symmetry will be investigated; in particular, the effects of approximate subsystem symmetry in orbitally-degenerate Mott insulators will be studied, and the theory of fractionalization of subsystem symmetry will be developed. In addition, generalizations of the renormalization group for fracton phases will be developed to help provide organizing principles to understand the vast array of theoretical models for fractons that have now been proposed. Work on correlated spin-orbit materials will focus on studying the thermodynamics and thermal transport in models of rare-earth magnetic moments coupled to a Zeeman magnetic field and to acoustic phonons. These models are expected to rather generically describe the physics of many rare-earth magnetic insulators under sufficiently large applied magnetic field, and may be important for understanding a variety of phenomena in these systems. In addition, theoretical physics support and expertise will be provided in collaborations with groups working on correlated spin-orbit materials from computational quantum chemistry, materials synthesis and experimental condensed matter physics points of view. Methods to be employed include systematic classifications and searches, large-N techniques, construction of both exactly solvable and more realistic model Hamiltonians, and development of new theoretical approaches. Both fracton phases and correlated spin-orbit quantum materials are at the forefront of efforts to characterize, classify, and elucidate the properties of new forms of quantum matter. The project research is expected to significantly advance these efforts."
Construction and Quantum States of Single and Yin-Yang Flat Bands,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-FG02-04ER46148,"Liu, Feng",Feng.Liu@universityofutah,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","This project, titled “Construction and Quantum States of Single and Yin-Yang Flat Bands”, is to carry out a comprehensive study of physical mechanisms that lead to formation of exotic many-body quantum electronic states associated with topological flat bands (FBs) in lattice models and FB materials. It encompasses three correlated research topics: (1) Orbital design of 2D/3D single and dual yin-yang flat bands and search of FB materials; (2) Complete population inversion between yin-yang FBs; (3) Fractional excitonic insulator state. The common theme of the proposed research is to improve our fundamental understanding of topological FBs, demonstrate novel and exotic many-body quantum phases arising from single and yin-yang FBs, and discover new classes of topological FB materials. Our theoretical/computational project will employ a multi-scale approach, combining several state-of-the-art theoretical and computational techniques, ranging from single-particle first-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations to tight-binding (TB) model Hamiltonian calculations and analyses, and to calculations and solutions of many-body Hamiltonian. Specifically, open-source package of DFT method combined with many-body GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation (e.g. Berkley-GW) and our newly developed in-house package of exact diagonalization (ED) method for solving many-body TB Hamiltonian will be used to study various excitonic states arising from photoexcitation, including fractional excitations, between yin-yang FBs. Topological properties of single-particle electronic states will be analyzed using conventional methods of calculating (spin) Chern numbers, while topology and fractional statistics of many-body quantum states will be analyzed using ED calculations of spectral flow, quasi-hole excitation and particle-cut entanglement spectra. Our studies will significantly improve our fundamental understanding of the nature and underpinning of many-body quantum states in association with single and yin-yang FBs, in terms of lattice symmetry and dimension, electron-electron Coulomb vs. exchange interaction and screening, and fractional statistics of band population. Both the continuations and new initiatives of the proposed research will significantly not only improve our fundamental understanding of the construction of topological FBs and realization of FBs-enabled many-body quantum states, but also expand the scope of topological FB materials and FB physics. They will provide useful guidelines for future experimental efforts in synthesis and characterization of new 2D and 3D topological FB materials. They will also have direct technological impact on advancing quantum materials and devices for energy applications, to fulfill the mission of the Department of Energy."

As such, developing a workforce capable of thriving in a quantum landscape is crucial. The goal of this project is to help meet this need and broaden participation in the QIST field. This goal will be achieved through a two-pronged approach; 1) focusing on providing student opportunities and support in the QIST field, and 2) focusing on faculty professional development aimed at building capacity within the California State University (CSU) system to provide sustained pathways into the QIST field. Student-focused activities include high school to undergraduate bridge programs, cohort-based learning communities, and hands-on research experiences, while faculty-focused activities will include workshops focusing on QIST concepts and effective pedagogy, faculty online learning communities supporting the incorporation of QIST topics into undergraduate curriculum, and QIST resource sharing across the CSU. By incorporating separate student-focused and faculty-focused activities, this project will have both immediate and long-term impacts on QIST workforce training and education."
Efficiently Resolving the Terrestrial-Aquatic Interface in E3SM with Sub-Grid Methods to Improve Coastal Simulations,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021105,"Westerink, Joannes",Joannes.Westerink@universityofnotredamedulac,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","During ordinary tidal cycles or storm-forced surge events, ocean waters flood overland areas and interact with rivers, complex streamflow networks, wetlands, marshes, and upland runoff. Correctly resolving the terrestrial-aquatic interface (TAI) is thus essential to accurately model coastal hydrodynamics. Current capability of MPAS-Ocean, the ocean component of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), resolves the ocean and its coast with unstructured mesh elements no finer than 6 km and is not anticipated to be finer than 2 km in the near future. While 6 km to 2 km resolution is a step forward for earth system models (ESMs), it remains insufficient to properly capture the TAI connecting the upland hydrology and the ocean through the complex dendritic hydraulic conveyances that penetrate the coastal floodplain. Resolving this in MPAS-Ocean would require coastal mesh resolution a hundred times finer than currently employed. While the use of MPAS-Ocean’s unstructured meshes allows flexibility in placing local resolution, resolving the TAI down to tens of meters over large regions will lead to a significant increase in the number of spatial unknowns to be solved for and will require reductions in the time step, increasing computational costs over current MPAS-Ocean models by on the order of ten thousand to a million times. This is infeasible given current and expected computing capabilities for climate applications requiring century-long simulations. An alternative lies with sub-grid models that integrate fine-scale properties of bathymetry, topography, and land cover to generate corrections to coarse-scale models such as MPAS-Ocean. Recent developments by the team in sub-grid theory and algorithms have been successfully implemented into storm surge models and current tests show that TAI sub-grid solutions will yield results comparable to standard solutions at least ten times coarser. Their tests demonstrate that the additional computational cost of such sub-grid methods in coastal regions is only a factor of 1.2 times more than the coarse mesh standard solution irrespective of the resolution of the underlying topographic data. This demonstrated a significant advantage of the sub-grid approach compared to the ten thousand to million times greater computational cost associated with directly resolving the TAI. In this project, the team will adapt and incorporate a sub-grid method into MPAS-Ocean to improve the effective resolution of the TAI. The sub-grid mode is a natural fit to the finite-volume type numerical solution used in the MPAS-Ocean model. Importantly, sub-grid methods once implemented into MPAS-Ocean will allow a much more accurate representation of coastal processes and the complex hydraulic connectivity between upland regions and the ocean than currently achieved, thus improving links in the water cycle. In doing so, the response of the fully coupled earth system at the TAI to short- and long-term perturbations can be better assessed. In particular, the team plan to evaluate the response of the system to short-term highly energetic land-falling hurricanes that have a dramatic effect on the TAI through tides, ocean surge, waves, intense rainfall, and wind damage to vegetation and property. The lasting effects of such a hurricane can extend out to time scales much longer than the duration of the meteorological event itself. Such an analysis would not be possible in the current E3SM model setup. The sub-grid-corrections that will be implemented in this project will make accurate information about coastal inundation and the TAI exchanges viable in MPAS-Ocean."

Stationary, grid-level storage of renewably energy sourced from wind and solar is driving development of next-generation battery chemistries. Stationary electrical energy storage (SEES) systems are becoming increasingly important as intermittent energy production from renewable energy sources is becoming more widespread. To achieve the adoption of large scale SEES systems at economically and environmentally sustainable levels, cost and volumetric energy density are driving the choice of battery chemistry. Giner, Inc. is developing a multi-functional membrane to advance commercial readiness and viability of room temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na-S) battery technology. The membrane is designed to both address the technical challenges of RT Na-S technology as well provide an unmet need for a viable separator compatible with commercial scale battery fabrication. In Phase I, we developed and characterized a membrane and demonstrated performance in full Na-S small scale cells. We have demonstrated improved capacity and capacity retention and developed a membrane which is compatible with large scale battery fabrication equipment. In Phase II, we will further develop this technology and focus on the scale up of the materials and fabrication process to demonstrate performance in prototype pouch cells. Pouch cells will be evaluated for energy density and cycle life under realistic grid-level conditions. Development of a RT Na-S battery technology for grid scale SEES applications is of enormous public benefit. Recent wide scale power outages due to an overburdened infrastructure highlight the need for technology to provide load leveling during peak power periods. As renewable energy from wind and solar becomes more widespread, SEES to store intermittent power generation for supplementing to grid power during low generation periods is key to widespread adoption of this technology. A low- cost, earth abundant solution with high volumetric energy density—such as the proposed RT Na-S battery technology—would bring the cost of energy storage to a fraction of what is currently possible and make renewable energy storage more accessible."
BENGI: A Bayesian ENGine for Insights,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0021506,"Brown, Donald","Donald.Brown@equityengineeringgroup,inc.,the","['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","BENGI: A Bayesian ENGine for Insights-Equity Engineering Group, Inc., 20600 Chagrin Boulevard, Suite 1200, Shaker Heights, OH 44122-5342 Donald Brown, Principal Investigator, dbrown@equityeng.com Donald Brown, Business Official, dbrown@equityeng.com Amount: $1,501,178 In the aging energy industries, pressurized fixed equipment and piping systems are exposed to harsh environments and operating conditions that promote a whirlwind of undesirable damage mechanisms. This damage may eventually result in catastrophic failure (leak or rupture) if left unchecked, with potentially significant consequences, especially if there is an environmental release of toxic or flammable fluids. Failure can also lead to loss of production, damage to nearby equipment, personnel injury, loss of life, and repair, replacement, and legal costs. To minimize the likelihood of unexpected failures, proactive inspection and maintenance plans are required. These plans require complex decision-making platforms to assist in integrating data and experience that ultimately end up in a series of decisions. From the foundational work accomplished in Phase I, we have developed an explainable AI engine for making such large-scale complex decisions. The core technology was made possible by leveraging DOE funded tensor engine libraries. This engine, called Bayesian ENGine for Insights (Bengi), is based on probabilistic cause-and-effect diagrams known as Bayesian Decision Networks. By using these networks, decisions under uncertainty are optimized in even the most complex scenarios to minimize cost, maximize profitability, and increase safety. Bayesian Networks properly blend data from various sources, such as human knowledge, mathematical models, numerical simulations, and field observations. In Phase I of this project: (1) We explored more advanced tensor contraction algorithms and data structures. In the end, we were able to integrate DOE HPC libraries into Bengi’s core tensor engine. Bengi now supports multiple backends.; (2) We built networks efficiently with a CPT library and thematic network generator. Now we can quickly generate networks on-the-fly without the use of a user-interface for systems level networks.; (3) Implemented the graph theoretic infrastructure to compute complex decision hierarchies. These algorithms were then used to implement the optimal decisions algorithm leveraging tensor solvers.; and (4) Incorporated these innovations into a user-interface, with a coherent user-experience in mind, to enable a wide array of users to have access to DOE-funded HPC software and resources. In Phase II of this project, the goal is to combine the modules that were developed in Phase I and extend, refine, verify, and commercialize those efforts as part of a complete decision-making solution for the next level of Life Cycle Management. To circumvent the limitations of traditional of Life Cycle Management and address the industry need for a financial-based automated decision support tool, we propose leveraging Bengi to develop Risk-Based Inspection Plus, a probabilistic cost-benefit analysis extension to traditional risk-based inspection that recommends optimal lifecycle decision strategies. During Phase II we will develop a market-ready the Risk-Based Inspection Plus software into a solution centered around facility-wide, financial-based inspection optimization with integrated fitness-for- service capabilities. The project is the fusion of tensor based HPC libraries and asset integrity management."

The 2015 DOE Nuclear Physics Long Range Plan lists as its central goals in the area of hot and dense QCD: Probe the inner workings of the QGP by resolving its properties at shorter and shorter length scales and Map the phase diagram of QCD. The physics goals of this project are well aligned with the above priorities. We characterize the properties of the QGP by quantitative extraction of important medium parameters from precision measurements of sensitive observables, including hadron spectra, angular distributions and correlations and jet observables, utilizing unique capabilities in the areas of Bayesian Statistics and model-to-data comparisons. In addition we study the early time dynamics and equilibration in the deconfined phase of QCD matter, a deeper understanding of which can shed significant insight on what drives the value and temperature dependence of the QGP transport coefficients on a microscopic basis. The project aims at achieving these goals based on a multi-pronged approach: to facilitate the extraction of the temperature and chemical potential dependence of the QGP transport coefficients with quantified uncertainties we focus on: QGP bulk dynamics: the treatment of transport coefficients in hybrid transport models is improved and applied to recently measured and previously not addressed collision systems and beam energies hard probes of the QGP: a new model for the dynamics of heavy quarkonia in the QGP is being developed, treating them consistently with open heavy flavor quarks and their hadronic final states (D-mesons, charmed hyperons) early time dynamics: different kinetic theory approaches are studied. These are highly relevant to the degree of thermalization of the systems, which is most likely incomplete for smaller collision systems. unique expertise in transport theory is utilized to implement a novel approach to jet energy-loss that treats soft non-perturbative interactions via a set of transport coefficients. This approach is very promising regarding its extendability to second order energy-loss calculations. The methodology developed in this project will benefit other scientific challenges requiring a computational model-to-data comparison and analysis, e.g. in stockpile stewardship, the environmental and atmospheric sciences, systems biology, material sciences, bio-medical engineering, cosmology, and nuclear structure. By combining access to very high statistics data comprised of billions of collision events with first principle physics inputs such as lattice QCD, the field of heavy ion collisions provides a unique testing ground for the application of Bayesian statistical methods. This is in contrast to other fields, such as stockpile stewardship, where access to data is limited. Results and insights will be communicated to other fields as appropriate and feasible."

Progress towards decarbonization is being achieved by the manufacture and deployment of renewable power. However, the eventual successful development of large-scale low-carbon energy will rely on new, or vastly expanded, uses of Earth systems. The Earth’s subsurface will be used for carbon sequestration to curb emissions during the transition from fossil fuels. Moreover, geologic rock formations are the only option for large-scale transient storage of hydrogen gas, which is receiving unprecedented attention as an energy storage medium and chemical fuel. These essential technologies have a broad range of basic, applied and engineering challenges that remain to be solved. A new generation of skilled geoscientists is urgently in need. Developing a strong geoscience workforce will require recruiting and training students from the fullest diversity of backgrounds. However, diversity in the Earth sciences is lowest among all STEM disciplines for decades. To address the critical need for a diverse geoscience workforce, we will establish a CSUB-LBNL BES Pathway Program to provide students at California State University, Bakersfield (CSUB) with new opportunities for geoscience education, research experiences, and long-term mentoring. Under the guidance of instructors from CSUB and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), student participants will investigate the nanoscale pore structure of caprocks in San Joaquin Basin of California and their interactions with fluids under in-situ temperature-pressure conditions. Caprock samples will be chosen based on their association with possible H2 and CO2 storage formations. Within the initial 3-year proposal period, the goal of this program is to increase the number of graduate applications in Earth science from CSUB. Beyond this 3-year period, the ultimate goal is to provide new career pathways for students from underrepresented groups to join LBNL or other university or national lab groups funded by BES. The program will be developed through a partnership between faculty and staff at CSUB, BES-funded scientists and staff in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Area (EESA) at LBNL, and the Workforce Development & Education (WD&E) department at LBNL, with the following components: An innovative two-way engagement program composed of 1) CSUB students and faculty visiting LBNL and 2) LBNL scientists engaging in CSUB seminar, teaching, and student recruiting events. A new course offered at CSUB co-developed by instructors from CSUB and LBNL that will train students in cutting-edge approaches to understand Earth materials for achieving sustainability. Summer internships for students in the CSUB course that provide research experiences, mentoring, peer-to-peer engagement, and geoscience focused career guidance. Hypothesis-driven basic research on nanoscale pore network of caprocks in San Joaquin Basin.

These 3D magnetic fields produce significant changes in the interaction of heat, particles, and radiation from these plasmas with vacuum vessel material surfaces that need to be predicted and controlled in burning fusion reactors. A major goal of the proposed work is developing control scenarios for naturally occurring transients due to edge instabilities (ELMs) that limit the performance and first wall lifetime of ITER, the proposed New Tokamak User Facility (NTUF), and other burning plasma devices. The research goals proposed address two of the four primary research objectives in FESAC 2014: 1) control of deleterious transient events, and 2) taming the plasma-material interface, as described in the DoE’s “Fusion Energy Sciences: A Ten-Year Perspective (2015– 2025)”. The project is divided into four research thrusts: 1) Develop realistic multi-mode modeling of externally applied fields and plasma response, 2) Understand the limitations of linear and nonlinear MHD models through validation of their predictions against available experimental data, 3) Understand the physics of magnetic island bifurcations and compare model predictions to available experimental measurements, and 4) Explore 3D fields for establishing innovative boundary radiative mantle scenarios for next-step, long-pulse burning plasmas. Thrust 1 will carry out resistive MHD simulations of the plasma response to 3D magnetic field perturbations. Thrust 1 will also employ Fractional Laplacian Spectral analytical code to model energy transport in stochastic magnetic fields. Results from this thrust will improve understanding of toroidal multi-mode effects in fusion devices, such as ITER. Thrust 2 will perform plasma response simulations with applied 3D perturbations using the nimrod resistive MHD code. Thrust 2 will compare nimrod predictions to experimental measurements on DIII-D and KSTAR. Thrust 2 will also develop synthetic diagnostics for validation studies. Thrust 3 will perform nimrod simulations of tokamak discharges to understand magnetic island bifurcations. Thrust 3 will determine the impact of island bifurcations on electron collisional transport. Thrust 4 will investigate novel approaches for creating cold, high density, stable radiating boundary and divertor plasma solutions needed to dissipate and control the energy and particle exhaust from burning plasmas, such as those planned for ITER. The proposed research will result in a substantial step toward establishing a robust operating scenario for controlling transients due to ELMs, which is fully compatible with radiative boundary plasmas. Demonstrating scenarios such as this is urgently needed for achieving the ITER mission and for the development of fusion plasma physics adapted for the advanced reactor regimes required for generating net electrical power."
Methane dynamics described through vegetation-soil interactions in bald cypress and other bottomland hardwood forests,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022228,"El Masri, Bassil",Bassil.El Masri@murraystateuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Natural wetland methane (CH4) fluxes play an important role in global climate change as CH4 is one of the major greenhouse gases. Our current understanding of the response of natural wetlands, particularly mineral soil wetland CH4 fluxes to climate change is still uncertain leading to large uncertainties in the global CH4 budget. While the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley has experienced the largest loss of forested wetlands in the U.S, supporting 21 to 25 million acres of bottomland hardwoods before European settlement, an estimated 5 million acres remain. This landscape remains under-studied from a CH4 flux perspective, particularly in determining woody vegetation contributions to landscape CH4 emissions. Our overarching objective are (1) to improve our understanding of the controls on CH4 fluxes in forested mineral soil wetlands, and (2) to better understand the effects of landscape position and forest composition on the CH4 fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Our main goal is to elucidate the dynamics of CH4 fluxes within forested wetland ecosystems to improve regional predictions in response to climate change and shifting hydrological oscillation patterns. Using a coupled modeling-experimental (ModEX) approach, our main scientific goal is to investigate the spatial and temporal carbon dynamics of a temperate bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), mineral soil wetland and an adjacent bottomland hardwood stand using a suite of measurements including new soil and tree (i.e., stem and “knee”) methane (CH4) flux observations. This proposal is therefore based on the premise that understanding methane fluxes in a temperate, forested wetland will advance mechanistic and model-ready science across a wide range of terrestrial-aquatic interface processes. The proposed processes and model modification will help to simulate the adapataiton of wetland ecosystems to a changing climate through better representations of the soil-vegetation interactions. By improving our understanding and modeling of CH4 processes at bald cypress swamp, this work aims to make significant contribution to two key sciences question in DOE objectives: (1) New or improved understanding of environmental controls and ecological processes in hydrologically oscillating zone on CH4 fluxes; and (2) Collection of new CH4 measurements."
A New High Flux with High Selectivity Membrane for Low Cost CO2 Capture,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0021584,"Alptekin, Gokhan","Gokhan.Alptekin@tdaresearch,inc.","['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","A New High Flux with High Selectivity Membrane for Low-Cost CO2 Capture-TDA Research, Inc., 12345 W. 52nd Ave., Wheat Ridge, CO 80033-1916 Gokhan Alptekin, Principal Investigator, galptekin@tda.com John Wright, Business Official, jdwright@tda.com Amount: $1,150,000 The electricity produced from fossil fuels is essential to the world’s prosperity and security, but the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by the fossil fuel combustion are implicated in climate change. Although there are several methods for separating CO2 from the flue gases, all have significant drawbacks, including loss of efficiency and high capital and operating costs that dramatically increase the cost of electricity. In this SBIR project, TDA Research (TDA) is developing a new inorganic composite membrane with high flux (>1,200 GPUs) and a high selectivity (>100) for removing CO2 from flue gas. Our membrane is easily scalable and can be tuned to provide high selectivity and flux even for dilute mixtures. The membrane’s uniform pore size will also exclude potential flue gas impurities such as SO2 and NOx that are larger than N2. Thus, we have the potential to carry out multiple separation steps in a single module. The objective of the Phase I work was to synthesize various membrane samples and assess their efficacy in flue gas treatment applications such as CO2/N2 separations. We evaluated the new membranes in a bench-top test unit to determine the separation efficiency (e.g., flux and selectivity). We showed that they can achieve fluxes >1,000 and selectivity >22. We assessed the impact of key operating parameters on performance (e.g., temperature, pressure) and evaluated the life of the membrane under representative conditions. The materials used in the selective layer were shown to be stable under the presence of H2O, SO2 and NOx, the contaminants present in the flue gas. Based on the results, we carried out an engineering design and estimated the cost of carbon capture to be $31.2/tonne, approaching the 2030 DOE cost target for transformational carbon capture technologies. In the Phase II, we will continue with the membrane optimization efforts. Using the most promising candidates, we will perform long duration tests (2,000 hr minimum) to assess the chemical and mechanical stability of the membranes. We will design and build a multi-membrane prototype and perform 1,000 hr (minimum) testing with the prototype to fully demonstrate its flawless operation. Based on the experimental data, we will design the full-scale post-combustion treatment system and carry out high fidelity engineering analysis and design to assess the merits of the new technology. CO2 is a major greenhouse gas and the major source. Most of the load is the result of the combustion of fossil fuels, in particular the burning of coal to generate electricity. The proposed technology will provide a cost-effective way to control CO2 emissions.

CABBI is comprised of 21 institutions, led by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and is organized around three interconnected themes, which align with the DOE priority research areas of Sustainability, Feedstock Production, and Conversion. CABBI addresses the following long-term goals: 1) Provide an integrated economic and environmental framework for determining feedstock supply and its sustainability; 2) Provide a regionally adaptive yet national-scale platform for grass-based biorefining based on high-yielding feedstocks with improved environmental resilience; 3) Provide a broad set of platform microorganisms, and automated tools to engineer them, to produce value-added products from plant-produced feedstocks or substrates. The economic and ecological sustainability of the entire production system is guided and evaluated by integrated models for techno-economic assessment (TEA) and life-cycle analysis (LCA) informed by measurements of agroecosystem function. Following a vision of “plants as factories,” biofuels, bioproducts, and foundation molecules are synthesized directly in highly productive, resilient and sustainable C4 grass feedstocks. Plant-derived oils and sugars are upgraded to higher-value platform compounds by highly engineered non-model yeasts. CABBI’s approach takes advantage of our team’s expertise in ecosystem ecology and agricultural economics, plant and microbial engineering, genomics, and computational biology. It leverages key facilities: Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology; Illinois Energy Farm; SoyFACE: the Integrative Bioprocessing Research Laboratory pilot plant; and the Illinois Biological Foundry for Advanced Biomanufacturing (iBioFAB). CABBI’s partner institutions contribute facilities for plant transformation, field trials, computation, and diverse molecular, chemical, and physiological analyses. CABBI research will substantially advance understanding of: • ecosystem carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling of agroecosystems and representation of that knowledge in models to predict the productivity and sustainability of feedstock production across diverse environments and under climate change; • multiscale, spatially explicit models integrating information on ecosystem function and land availability for bioenergy production as well as refinery-scale TEA and LCA so that we may predict paths to meet demand for bioenergy and bioproducts under different climate, market, and policy scenarios; • C4 grass genomes and methods to more efficiently manipulate them through breeding and biotechnology for crop improvement; • the genetics, biochemistry, and physiology requisite to engineer high-value bioproduct synthesis, abiotic stress tolerance, and resource use efficiency in feedstock crops; • machine learning and automation to accelerate the DBTL cycle and design novel enzymatic functions; and • the genetic and physiological constraints that limit production of high-value compounds by nonmodel yeasts with distinct native metabolism. In summary, CABBI will deliver resilient, highly productive grasses containing large amounts of lipids and targeted to rainfed marginal lands, along with microbial conversion technologies to produce high-value platform chemicals from plant biomass, and demonstrate their economic and environmental viability."

Interactive effects of press and pulse disturbances on biogeochemical cycling of a wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022095,"Cavaleri, Molly",Molly.Cavaleri@michigantechnologicaluniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Tropical forests represent one of Earth’s most active biogeochemical engines: Although only ~12% of the planet’s terrestrial surface supports tropical forests, they account for over 2/3 of live terrestrial plant biomass, nearly one-third of all soil carbon, and these forests exchange more carbon dioxide with the atmosphere than any other terrestrial biome. The primary objective of the proposed work is to use a one-of-a kind field warming experiment in Puerto Rico and a cutting-edge modeling approach to advance a robust, predictive understanding of how the individual and interacting disturbances of increasing temperatures and altered precipitation affect above- and belowground carbon cycling in tropical forested ecosystems. The Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment (TRACE) in Puerto Rico is the only field warming experiment in the world that integrates both plant and soil warming in a tropical forest, and thus is uniquely positioned to investigate and model the controls and interactions critical to forecasting tropical forest responses to a changing climate. In particular, TRACE has amassed an exceptional dataset of above- and belowground processes and conditions that include identification of the individual and interacting effects of multi-year in situ warming, natural extreme climatic disturbances (e.g., drought, large precipitation events), and associated changes to forest communities and biogeochemical cycles. With the help of TRACE’s long-time modeling partners, the project is ready to incorporate data from multiple facets of TRACE inquiry into a synthetic modeling framework, as well as iteratively collect new data to assess the potential for acclimation over the longer-term as well as advance the understanding and capacity to numerically represent these productive ecosystems. The team will integrate and scale complex above- and belowground processes using ELM, the land component of the DOE Earth System Model (E3SM), coupled with a model that represents vegetation demography (FATES). The effort proposed here enables the synthesis of whole-forest effects of warming and precipitation disturbance, from 1-meter deep in the soil to the tops of the canopy, and to directly address the DOE missions to develop fruitful dialogs between modelers and experimentalists and investigate ecosystem responses, feedbacks, and recovery from extremes events and chronic perturbations. Our ability to accurately represent tropical forests in climate models lags far behind that of many temperate ecosystems and, as a result, they account for numerous large uncertainties and biases in ESMs. We have developed an integrative, hypothesis-driven approach to directly address this large gap in existing state-of-the-art models and to significantly advance our understanding of how tropical forest carbon cycling will respond to global change."
Remote Sensing of Plant Functional Traits for Modeling Arctic Tundra Carbon Dynamics,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021094,"Fraterrigo, Jennifer",Jennifer.Fraterrigo@boardoftrusteesoftheuniversityofillinois,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Permafrost carbon feedbacks to global climate are a major concern because the Arctic is warming twice as fast as other regions and >50% of the global belowground organic carbon (C) pool is stored in permafrost and overlying soils. Thawing of permafrost and frozen soils can expose organic C to decomposition, potentially converting these ecosystems into sources of CO2 and accelerating warming. Plant communities in the Arctic tundra are also responding to warming, and these changes are expected to alter key biogeochemical and physical processes that feedback to climate. However, the direction and magnitude of effects are highly uncertain because tundra vegetation responses to warming are non-uniform and poorly represented in models. The proposed research develops capacity for the remote estimation of aboveground and belowground plant functional traits and streamlines their inclusion in process models to quantify and predict regional C balance. Specifically, we will characterize directly observable plant functional traits from remotely sensed data; predict non-observable (e.g., belowground) traits by leveraging trait-environment relationships and trait covariation; and integrate this information into a newly developed modeling framework to quantify and predict terrestrial C stocks, fluxes, and their uncertainties in the Alaskan tundra. We will test four hypotheses: (1) Plant functional traits are predominantly shaped by climate, with local soil moisture moderating trait response to climate, but optimal trait values for a given environment depend on community type because plant functional types (PFTs) have different sensitivities to altered resources associated with climate warming. (2) Trait dispersion depends on environmental stress; where environmental conditions are more favorable for growth, there is greater variation in traits and overall greater trait diversity; (3) Given trait tradeoffs and trait-environment interactions, root traits are predictable from leaf and size traits, climate and soil factors; and (4) Variation in traits affect Arctic C balance. Leaf traits as they relate to photosynthetic parameters will have the strongest effects on C uptake. Root traits will exhibit fewer direct effects on C uptake but will be important in supporting nutrient uptake that then influences C uptake. To test these hypotheses, we will study the variation in plant traits across the major tundra vegetation communities present along local soil gradients nested within a macroclimate gradient in northern Alaska, quantifying trait-environment relationships and trait covariation at the community- and PFT-levels. Using machine-learning approaches, we will integrate ground-based measurements with information derived from multi-scale remote sensing platforms from drone, hypertemporal, LiDAR, and hyperspectral imagery to produce maps of leaf, size and root traits, greatly expanding the trait information available for modelers. We will use Bayesian data-model fusion methods to improve the parameterization and formulation of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, which is widely used in Arctic carbon studies, and perform simulation experiments to evaluate how differences in plant functional traits affect C dynamics. To synergize the trait-based modeling community, we will create a workshop to share findings and strategies for improving the representation of trait variation in ecosystem and Earth System Models (ESMs). The proposed research directly supports the DOE near-term priorities by improving understanding of the interactions and feedbacks among above- and belowground plant system components and related soil-plant-atmosphere processes in a region that is inadequately represented in ESMs. Current models reduce the complexity of Arctic vegetation to a small number of PFTs. This approach implicitly assumes that each PFT represents the average ecological function of its constituent species, thus ignoring the effects of trait variation on carbon cycling and potentially leading to large uncertainty in the sign and magnitude of ecosystem feedbacks to climate. We will fill critical gaps in our understanding of the dominant PFTs and facilitate the development of alternative modeling approaches that allow the traits of PFTs to vary, thereby vastly enhancing the capacity of simulation models to project ecosystem carbon dynamics in a rapidly changing Arctic."
Conformationally-Steered Hierarchical Self-Assembly at Solid Surfaces,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020961,"Ye, Tao",Tao.Ye@theregentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Biology-inspired self-assembly can control geometry and composition at finer length scales that are largely inaccessible via top down approaches, such as lithography. To allow self-assembly to control matter at larger spatial scales, specific interactions such as base-pairing interactions may be introduced at the edges of these mesoscale structures (tiles) to allow them to programmably interconnect to form superstructures. However, connecting multiple unique tiles to form complex hierarchical structures has been prohibitively difficult. Currently, little is known how these tiles approach each other and become kinetically trapped. Nor do we have sophisticated means of regulating the pathways of self-assembly. Moreover, even if these large superstructures could be correctly formed in solution, the integration of these fragile structures to traditional circuits and devices, which often requires site-specific deposition onto a solid support, remains challenging. This project aims to systematically elucidate the roles of interfacial interactions on self-assembly of biomolecular nanostructures and tailor these interactions to steer the self-assembly pathways of complex hierarchical structures. The team will site-specifically nucleate the formation of surface-tethered biomolecular complexes on dynamic surfaces that allow them to precisely control interfacial interactions and then allow the complexes to connect to form superstructures. They will combine in situ, single molecule techniques with multiscale modeling to elucidate intermediates and self-assembly pathways. By probing and steering interactions between biomolecular complexes and those between biomolecular complexes and the solid surface, the surface will serve as the conduit that allows top-down methods to exert spatial and temporal control over mesoscale self-assembly. Hence, this approach has the potential to form higher order structures that have been inaccessible via existing approaches of self-assembly. Such hierarchical 2D materials have ramifications in applications such as energy harvesting, nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, and nanomagnetics. While this project uses DNA origami and DNA bricks superstructures as the model system, the proposed strategy to study and manage nonspecific interactions in mesoscale self-assembly may be extended to other biomaterials."

However, accurate image alignment is a bottleneck due to the poor contrast of individual molecules images. Therefore, in practice, structures of only relatively large macromolecules can be determined by cryo-EM SPR. Phase plates are devices that enhance the signal in cryo-EM images, but current approaches to data collection do not allow us to capitalize on this enhancement. In order to achieve dramatically higher contrast, a much more precise data collection setup is required. The overall objective of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to develop enabling technologies for optimal use of the Volta phase plate so its contrast improvement potential can be realized. For practical reasons, this requires ultra-fast analysis of huge image datasets in real-time, necessitating the development of GPU-based algorithms. These methods will enable highly efficient data collection with the high level of precision necessary to use phase plates close-to-focus where the contrast enhancement is the highest. We will develop, implement, and test multiple calibration procedures, with the faster ones performed for each data collection area, while slower, more elaborate ones are performed much less frequently. We will implement full data collection control with real-time data analysis to provide feedback and initial approximation to final results. The redesign of the approach to data collection using a phase plate will benefit all types of cryo-EM SPR and fiber reconstruction: (1) the resolution of many reconstructions will improve significantly, (2) cryo-EM will be applicable to projects where particles have lower mass, and (3) molecular motions for larger particles can be better identified and analyzed. These benefits are of high significance for this quickly expanding field, so the potential for successful commercialization is high."

Specifically, refractory materials such as molybdenum, tungsten, and alloys containing them are found to be most resistant in molten salt environment and hence they have great potential to be used as the salt-facing surface layer. Due to the well-recognized difficulties of welding/printing refractory materials (i.e., oxidation, brittle phase formation, cracking, etc.), cold spray, a deposition technology that minimizes material heating, avoids undesired thermal effects and maintains dimension stability, is an ideal approach for fabricating the bimetallic components. Under this SBIR Phase II program, QuesTek Innovations LLC, a leader in the field of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and 2016 Tibbetts Award recipient, will continue partnering with Solvus Global and Cal Poly Pomona to design, fabricate and validate cold spray enabled bimetallic structures, consisting of a refractory-based corrosion resistant surface layer and an ASME code-certified substrate, for molten salt reactors (MSR). In Phase I, the team has successfully designed and fabricated proof-of-concept bimetallic materials using SS316 as substrate that experimentally exhibited excellent deposition quality, interface adhesion and corrosion resistance. During the Phase II program, the ICME materials design and cold spray processing technology demonstrated in Phase I will continue to be developed and optimized, in tandem with implementing an additional approach of functionally graded materials (FGM) to further improve the robustness and performance of the cold-sprayed structure for nuclear applications. QuesTek will continue applying its ICME materials design methodologies to refine the refractory surface layer compositions developed in Phase I and explore new designs. In addition, QuesTek will be developing and implementing a computational gradient design framework to assist in designing FGM pathways with optimized performance of the bimetallic structure. Solvus Global, a leading company dedicated to advanced cold spray technology, will continue to lead the cold spray related tasks. They will develop the powder materials defined by QuesTek’s computational modeling, optimize cold spray processing parameters, manufacture bimetallic materials, including functionally graded structure, and conduct detailed metallurgical characterization and adhesion tests on the fabricated materials. Prof. Vilupanur Ravi at Cal Poly Pomona (CPP) is a distinguished professor with extensive experience in materials degradation in molten salt environment. His group will continue to perform detailed and carefully designed molten salt corrosion tests and characterization. Towards the end of the 2-year Phase II program, the team will work to further scale-up production efforts based on the down-selected material systems. The target batch size for initial production-level readiness will be on the order of 20-100lbs per batch."

Successful, development of new radionuclide production techniques has made it easier to incorporate these radionuclides into new, improved pharmaceuticals. Radioisotopes of scandium are of particular interest thanks to prior, successful DOE-funded efforts, but they currently lack a convincing demonstration of radiolabeling and application in a form that can easily be moved to the clinic. We believe that exciting Sc-based radiopharmaceuticals have been impeded by a significant gap in our knowledge of how scandium interacts with the chemistry of these drugs in environmental conditions like those in the human body. The collaboration between Stony Brook University and the University of Wisconsin has already discovered new and interesting scandium chemical principles help to explain the current deficiencies in Sc-based radiopharmaceuticals and suggest radiochemical techniques that can be used to remedy them. We propose to fabricate and test in vivo novel generators of radioactive scandium that feed kit-style pharmaceutical preparations of 44gSc-labeled. The scandium radionuclides already possess physical and radiochemical properties that are superior to current clinical standards of care; our work will dramatically magnify opportunities for clinical incorporation of DOE produced scandium radioisotopes for medical applications."

It relates a gravitational theory in some spacetime to a non-gravitational theory in a different spacetime, with the latter spacetime possessing fewer dimensions than the former. In particular, a universe well-described by Einstein’s general theory of relativity is encoded in a non-gravitational many-body quantum system that is often said to live “on the boundary” of the gravitational theory, analogous to a hologram. The so-called AdS/CFT correspondence from string theory is the most concrete instantiation of the holographic principle, and it posits that spacetime is an emergent notion, encoded nontrivially in the dynamics of the ""boundary"" theory. In this context, the AdS stands for anti de-Sitter, a spacetime geometry with negative curvature analogous to an M.C. Escher painting, and the CFT stands for the “boundary” conformal field theory, a special type of (typically very strongly interacting) quantum system. However, many aspects of the holographic principle remain implicit and poorly understood, which obscures fundamental questions about quantum gravity such as the nature of the black hole interior or the emergence of spacetime. Furthermore, holography has not been as well-understood in spacetimes outside of asymptotically anti de-Sitter space. This includes ordinary flat spacetime which is a good approximation, for many purposes, to the real world, and is the setting for a rapidly developing holographic dictionary called celestial holography. This research project leverages recent developments at the intersection of string theory, algebra, and geometry to develop new mathematical frameworks for both AdS/CFT and celestial holographic systems. This approach aims to help clarify and compute basic observables in the holographic dictionary from a novel perspective, and to work towards a mathematical proof of aspects of holography."

The stability of these beams, and thus the intensity limit, comes from the approach of designing accelerators with a linear lattice. The integrable optics technique fixes this problem by making the accelerator manifestly non-linear, but also stable. This technique requires a special non-linear magnet system that is custom to each accelerator that uses it. The integrable optics technique is currently being tested at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator at Fermilab. After that test, the next step is a facility-sized implementation of integrable optics. One proposed test is the replacement of the Fermilab booster ring with a rapid cycling synchrotron (iRCS) that uses integrable optics. That accelerator will require a larger version of the special non- linear insert we built for IOTA at Fermilab. We are proposing here to build one of the special non- linear magnets for the replacement booster ring. During Phase I, we advanced the magnetic design of the non-linear insertion. We optimized the solution for the non-linear field potential, which allowed the proper harmonic content for a larger aperture required in iRCS and performed tolerance study. Furthermore, we created the mechanical engineering model pursuing the main goal of fabrication cost reduction. In Phase II, we will fabricate, assemble and test the new non-linear insert design for a larger accelerator – iRCS booster – and upgrade our magnetic measurement systems that are needed to measure the magnetic fields of the new 8m-long insertion. The principal users of these magnets are large national laboratories upgrading or building high intensity particle accelerators. Other potential uses include as a driver for accelerator driven subcritical fission reactors that produce shorter half-life daughter products and use fuel that is less weaponizable, e.g. thorium."

The kinetics of single-phase gas adsorption in such materials continues to be of particular interest in real-world applications where gases are captured or otherwise separated, e.g., CO2 capture or gas purification. The goal of this project is to evaluate to what extent the well-understood standard kinetics can or cannot be used to describe or predict effects of gases when adsorbed in nano-confined environments. In particular, the main objective is to elucidate the kinetics governing the behavior of gases in such environments by (i) disentangling kinetic from thermodynamic effects and (ii) identifying diffusion mechanisms and assessing their effect on the standard theory of kinetics. For the disentangling we use a specially designed series of sequential and simultaneous in situ gas-loading experiments; diffusion mechanisms are identified by combining in situ spectroscopic measurements with ab initio modeling. Our objective is designed to address the following research questions: Why and how can standard approaches for describing kinetics and adsorption fail when applied to gases in nano-confined environments? To what extent are kinetic and thermodynamic effects of gases in nano-porous materials typically entangled? Why do gases behave so differently in nano-porous materials? The focus of our research will be on finding and identifying common characteristics of systems that go beyond the standard theory of kinetics, i.e. the Arrhenius equation. Due to their porous nature, structural diversity, functional flexibility, and unprecedented design freedom, metal organic frameworks will provide the main platform and serve as our nano-confined environments to address our objective. We will study well-established metal organic frameworks as well as synthesize new ones with carefully tuned pore dimensions and functionalities. These nano-porous materials will allow us to probe a wide array of different types of nano-confinement. The complementary techniques of in situ vibrational spectroscopy and ab initio modeling will be the cornerstones of our proposed work and will be closely integrated with synthesis to achieve our objective. This synergistic program will transform our understanding of the adsorption of nano-confined gases in porous materials and significantly advance technologies vital to the mission of the US Department of Energy, including the capture and removal of greenhouse gases, hydrocarbon separation, detoxification of industrial emissions, and air remediation."

Understanding the dynamics of plant-microbe-mineral interactions within the rhizosphere, the region in the soil closest to the roots, is particularly important in addressing agricultural sustainability. Oxygen (O2) is key to processes in the rhizosphere including microbial and root respiration, nitrogen-cycling including nitrification and denitrification, and the biodegradation and oxidation of organic contaminants. The subsurface oxygen concentration and isotopic signature can be leveraged to identify the different oxygen consumption or loss pathways, and its diffusion in and out of the rhizosphere region. The overall objective of this SBIR project is to develop a technique to detect subsurface oxygen and its isotopes with millimeter-scale spatial resolution, enabling direct interrogation of the rhizosphere. A microvolume probe is coupled with a reaction module and an infrared spectrometer, for precisely measuring the concentrations and isotopic signatures of oxygen. In Phase I a microvolume probe, reactor for conversion of O2 to carbon dioxide (CO2), and an interface connecting these units with a tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectrometer (TILDAS) were designed and built. The TILDAS instrument was configured for simultaneous measurement of the three most abundant oxygen isotopes of carbon dioxide, C16O16O, C16O18O and C16O17O. Laboratory tests of the combined probe, mixing volume, reactor, and TILDAS in a benchtop system successfully demonstrated measurement of oxygen and its isotopic signature in microvolume samples. The conversion parameters (e.g. oven temperature, heating time, reaction pressure) were optimized, achieving >97% conversion of oxygen while minimizing isotopic fractionation. Tests in soil surrounding plant roots were successful, with a shift in the 18O isotopic ratio from ambient air observed. During the Phase II project the conversion technology and microvolume probes will be further refined. A field deployable prototype system consisting of probes, reactor, and TILDAS will be designed and built. The compatibility of the microvolume probes for other trace gas and VOC monitors will also be studied. The overall proposed system will be field demonstrated in soil experiments in a laboratory, greenhouse and at a DOE biofuel agricultural research facility. These experiments will provide proof of concept for the use of these mm-scale measurements to elucidate drivers of soil biogeochemical processes. Understanding how to work with and not against soil organisms is important for agricultural health and productivity. The proposed system will serve as a window into soil nutrient cycling, plant-microbe-mineral interactions, and effects of external forces (drought, flooding climate change) on soil processes. With this information, biofuel and soil research scientists, agronomists, and “smart” and precision farmers, will be able to identify and address key parameters to improve sustainable production at agricultural and bioenergy sites."

We will explore how ONeMg supernovae might produce distinctive line sources of axions via nuclear decay processes. We are leading a community study of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, to ensure that the best possible microphysics is used in the planned solar modeling effort that will be undertaken, in support the Plato mission (which will probe the seismology of hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way). 2) We will complete lattice QCD work on the axial vector form factor of the nucleon, with the goal of 1-6% accuracy depending on the momentum transfer. This effort is crucial to Fermilab's Long Baseline neutrino program as the lattice results are more accurate than and in disagreement with old data used in neutrino event generators. The lattice offers the best hope of eliminating uncertainties that currently threaten the goals of the experiment. 3) The effective theory approach to nuclear structure and reactions we have developed (HOBET) is now being extended to larger nuclei, so that the convergence of the underlying short-range expansion can be evaluated. We will do the first applications to inelastic nuclear reactions, including the production of deuterium in n+p scattering and the production of 3He in d+p scattering. 4) With collaborators at Ohio University, we will continue to develop high-order chiral equations of state for dense nuclear matter at both zero and finite temperature, for isospin asymmetric matter. The method is many-body perturbation theory, implemented using advanced numerical methods for enumerating and evaluating diagrams. This work supports efforts to understand neutron stars and their binary mergers. 5) We will complete studies of the electric dipole moment (edm) of 229Pa, which is an outstanding candidate for an FRIB program on time-reversal violation due to the copious production of this isotope at FRIB. We are part of an experimental collaboration that seeks to verify that the parity doublet seen earlier at Argonne does exist. In this experiment, the interpretation of the internal conversion rate (our responsibility) is a subtle problem due to dynamical screening effects unique to this transition. This isotope should have a greatly enhanced sensitivity to sources of CP violation. 6) We will develop effective operators for both single and double beta decay, with the goal of decreasing uncertainties in neutrinoless double beta decay rate predictions. Double beta decay is an important priority of the field's most recent nuclear physics long range plan. We will further develop our effective theory treatment of muon-to-electron conversion, working with particle theory colleagues to match our nuclear-level effective theory to one formulated at the light quark, gluon, and photon level. 7) Our group performed the first realistic calculations of the electromagnetic signals of a kilonova, the debris produced in a neutron star merger. This work produced the first convincing evidence that a site for the r-process has been found. The work will continue through collaborative efforts to further develop high performance codes for nuclear astrophysics, such as CASTRO and SEDONA. The longterm goal is the creation of end-to-end simulation tools for explosive astrophysics, linking the underlying neutrino and nuclear microphysics to late-time observables, such as the nucleosynthetic and electromagnetic signals of supernovae and mergers. We are leading the exascale computing initiative for this field. 8) Using our new, analytic composite fermion representation, we will investigate open questions in the fractional quantum Hall effect. One goal is to show that anomalous states of fractional filling 4/11 and 3/8 can be understood as a natural generalization of the series of fillings Laughlin and Jain first described. This work is done by the PIs, postdocs (including one funded through a Neutrino Theory Network fellowship and another through an NSF Astronomy fellowship), and graduate students, collaboratively, and involves frequent interactions with the experimental community. The training of young researchers and the support of the nation's experimental programs are important goals of the group."

Light-matter interactions in layered and two-dimensional materials represent a method to both achieve extreme optical confinement approaching the atomic scale, and a tool for observing and exploring new materials phenomena. Layered narrow bandgap and zero bandgap materials, such as black phosphorus, graphene, and transition metal dichalcogenides support unusual and intriguing quantum-confined electronic states in thin layers and surface electronic states. The incomplete screening of applied electrostatic fields in ultrathin layers allows for exploration of light-matter interactions at high electric fields and carrier densities, enabling interrogation of materials properties over a wide range of Fermi level conditions in a single sample. This enables us to explore the relationship between the electrochemical potential and the optical and plasmonic properties of ultrathin and layered materials. Our research project seeks to understand: 1) Optical interband and intraband plasmon excitations in narrow bandgap layered semiconductors such as black phosphorus, and how strong electrostatic fields alter the band occupancy and electronic structure of thin narrow bandgap semiconductors. Gate control of the Fermi level in black phosphorus heterostructures may enable creation of materials with tunable birefringence at optical frequencies, and in-plane optical dispersion at infrared frequencies, including a tunable in-plane hyperbolic optical dispersion. 2) The nature of hybridized photonic states at the interfaces of black phosphorus twisted bilayer heterostructures and twisted layer heterostructures between black phosphorus and molybdenum ditelluride. By creating heterostructures with small enough twist angle between layers whose constituent lattices are commensurate one expects atomic reconstruction; similarly, by forming superlattices between incommensurate systems one can develop highly strained Moiré potentials with strong pseudo-magnetic fields. These effects are expected to yield new optical properties associated with interband and intraband transitions and can be studied in BP/BP or bilayer-BP/MoTe2 twisted bilayer systems. Our approach will combine experiments and simulations and is informed by theory. The synthetic work includes two-dimensional layered heterostructure fabrication, combined with nanostructures fabricated by electron beam lithography and twisted-layer fabrication. Optoelectronic and structural characterization will include infrared and low temperature optical spectroscopy using laboratory-based and synchrotron radiation sources at Department of Energy user facilities, and transport measurements in under solid-state field effect gating configurations. Expected outcomes include understanding of i) an understanding of exciton and quasi-particle dynamics in layered materials; 2) an understanding of interfacial excitonic and plasmonic phenomena in twisted bilayer heterostructures between in-plane anisotropic and isotropic materials; 3) understanding of the excited state dynamics in layered materials coupled to nanophotonic cavities."

To make these modules work efficiently within the existing telecom fiber infrastructure, it is necessary to convert a photon’s wavelength from the telecom bands, for non-lossy transmission through the fiber, to that which is optimal for the various quantum devices (e.g. quantum sources and buffers). Currently available technologies cannot efficiently convert the wavelength of single photons, preventing the realization of transparent optical quantum networks. Rather than solve the complicated problem of single-photon frequency conversion, we propose merging the frequency conversion and entanglement generation into a single device. Such a device would create pairs of entangled photons at two wavelengths, one native to atomic quantum systems and the other in the telecom band. At the heart of our device, a frequency conversion structure converts uncorrelated light pulses into polarization- entangled single photon pairs at two different frequencies. The proposed device uses the atomic transitions of a well-characterized vapor, rubidium (Rb), to access a wide variety of wavelengths, including telecom O and C bands for fiber transmission, near-Infrared for quantum storage/buffering, and near-UV for trapped-ion qubits. Our 2-in-1 module for frequency conversion and photon pair generation results in a very bright entanglement source that is simultaneously compatible with telecom fiber optics and quantum modules such as buffers and atomic processors. During Phase I, we experimentally demonstrated the production of true bichromatic entangled photons with a spectral brightness significantly larger than any available product in the market. We are now proposing a clear technical path towards improving the key parameters of the frequency converting source while investigating the most optimal designs towards a commercially available MVP. The proposed technology holds the key to building quantum buffer-assisted, all-optical quantum networks. Our approach eliminates the need for separate entanglement sources and frequency conversion systems, given that our proposed entanglement source produces photons that are natively compatible both with optical fiber networks, for the long-distance transfer of information, and atomic quantum systems, for the storing and processing of quantum information. In the near term, this technology can assist many scientists at the DOE and other agencies with their work towards the national quantum internet. In the long term, US-based and global quantum networks can use our devices in every node to distribute entanglement across the networks."

Anion exchange membranes with high hydroxyl ion conductivity and extremely low permeability for hydrogen and oxygen gases, and high mechanical strength and chemical stability are sought by DOE for solar-to- hydrogen generator applications. This Small Business Innovation Research project aims to develop a novel high-performance anion exchange membrane for solar-to-hydrogen generator applications based on the current state-of-the-art anion conducting ionomers having the highest hydroxyl ion conductivity with a novel reinforcement approach by integration of an intriguing reinforcement support. In Phase I, the new reinforced membranes have been prepared and evaluated in terms of microstructural features, chemical stability, mechanical durability, and electrochemical properties, and tested for solar-to-hydrogen operation using a tandem PEC cell. The reinforced membrane attains high stability with significantly enhanced mechanical durability and has shown increased crossover resistance to hydrogen and oxygen gas permeation. Besides, the reinforced membrane shows increased hydroxyl ion conductivity relative to the non-reinforced membrane, which is an attractive feature unique to this novel membrane. Overall, this membrane has been demonstrated to have high potential of meeting DOE performance requirements for solar-to-hydrogen generator applications. The Phase II work is to build on the Phase I outcome and systematically optimize the material system, processing, and performance of the new membrane. The membrane will be comprehensively evaluated in terms of all relevant properties. Commercially viable prototype membranes will be produced and tested for full cell operation. Development of production scale-up scheme will also be initiated during Phase II. The expected product of the present effort is a new reinforced anion exchange membrane that critically determines performance of photoelectrochemical cells for solar fuels generators. Ion exchange membrane is also the key component in many other energy generation, conversion or storage systems, including fuel cells, electrolyzers, and redox flow batteries. The demand for ion exchange membranes used in such energy systems is very high and keeps increasing in the future."

However, the processes that govern cloud-aerosol interactions, drizzle formation and precipitation are poorly understood and represent major sources of uncertainty in predictive models. The DOE ARM Facilities and other global atmospheric measurement networks provide data that are used for development and improvement of these models. Quantifying the uncertainty of these measurements is critically important. Although the majority of instruments may be well-characterized in a laboratory setting, deploying them in field conditions greatly increases the measurement uncertainties. Field calibration capabilities need to be developed. This SBIR project is developing an innovative portable, battery-powered aerosol generator for field calibration of atmospheric measurement instrumentation such as in situ cloud droplet probes and aerosol sizing and precipitation measurement instruments. The ultimate goal is to develop a technology that is compact, robust, low-maintenance, user-friendly and inexpensive to allow wide-scale deployment of the proposed aerosol generators over atmospheric measurement facilities. The Phase I study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed technical approach. The main results include: (1) constructing and characterizing a laboratory prototype of the monodisperse aerosol generator; (2) demonstrating its performance characteristics under a wide range of conditions and outlining the calibration procedures; and (3) identifying the engineering challenges of transitioning the technology to a standalone portable prototype useful for field calibration of atmospheric measurement instrumentation in Phase II. In Phase II, a field deployable prototype of the monodisperse aerosol generator will be designed, built and characterized. The prototype will undergo extensive laboratory and field testing. As a result, a field calibration technology for atmospheric measurement instrumentation that is basically ready for commercialization will be developed. Successful completion of this program will lead to development of a monodisperse aerosol generator primarily designed for field calibration of a variety of atmospheric measurement instruments. When carried over into Phase III and beyond, this project will be of great benefit to the public and the Federal Government. Improved measurement accuracy will lead to development of more precise atmospheric models and, hence, better understanding of the contribution of atmospheric aerosols and clouds to Earth’s radiative budget and global climate trends."

Surface and volume defect formation and migration in conjunction with carrier transport processes have a profound impact on the opto-electro-thermo-mechanical properties of materials. Understanding these phenomena requires a unique combination of advanced atomic- scale imaging with controlled nanoscale excitation and quantitative probing of fundamental processes. The proposed innovation is focused on a method for simultaneous nanoscale multimodal imaging of energy conversion/transfer processes by integrating tip-based pulsed laser radiation sources within a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Nanoscale confinement of radiation fields of enhanced intensity underneath a tip-based probe enables unambiguous and direct in-situ interrogation of the nanostructural effects on the material properties. In this project, an apparatus combining nanoscale laser excitation and optical signal collection of photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), ultrafast optical probing and Raman spectra will be designed, tested and integrated into a TEM holder. In Phase I, tapered fiber and near field probe tips have been employed for excitation of the optical response of the specimen with nanoscale spatial resolution. Custom miniature optics for efficient signal collection and a benchtop prototype apparatus has been designed and constructed, which enabled far-field and near-field PL spectroscopy while meeting the requirements for implementation into the TEM instrumentation. Based on this work, Phase II project is proposed to construct and test an integrated TEM holder for in-situ multimodal optical spectroscopy and validate its performance via detailed ex-situ TEM experiments and analytical diagnostics. Furthermore, the prototype will be tested in the real scientific studies, for example, in-situ characterization of defects in the synthesis of nanostructures. The outcome of this project will enable a widespread adoption of unique facility for the in situ direct correlation of optical spectroscopy with atomic level imaging. This entirely new capability will undoubtedly have a profound impact to the fields of Materials Science and Manufacturing. The users of the proposed approach can embark on a host of fundamental studies on the true nanoscale interaction of photons with materials that are impossible to conduct by the presently available instrumentation. For instance, the in-situ laser probe will give a user a front row seat to examining fundamental features of energy conversion and transfer processes."

The problem is that 177Lu has a short (6.65 day) half-life and current manufacturing processes for high purity 177Lu are complex and time consuming. This includes irradiation of a target followed by complex chemical purification techniques, resulting in significant loss of the product from radioactive decay and other losses. The goal of this project is to develop an improved purification process that can deliver 177Lu faster, at lower costs and with higher efficacy, resulting in a better supply for cancer patients. This is directly related to the US Department of Energy Isotope Program’s mandate to support production of isotopes that are in short supply for research and applications and of strategic importance to the United States. The approach is the application of innovative high-pressure fluids to rapidly isolate the 177Lu. In Phase I, a chemical system was demonstrated to deliver chemical purification which exceeds the industry standard by 30%. A full-scale prototype was built and demonstrated for purification of non-radioactive lutetium. A provisional patent was filed for the technology. In the first year of Phase II, the prototype will be enhanced and automated, and process parameters will be optimized by continued testing with non-radioactive lutetium. In the second year of Phase II, the 177Lu isotope will be generated at full scale via nuclear irradiation at a partnering research institution. The radioactive material will be purified using the prototype, thereby demonstrating the entire production life cycle at full scale from beginning to end. The commercial application will be adoption of this technology by an isotope supplier to deliver a reliable supply of high-purity 177Lu for cancer treatment. Demand for this isotope is increasing rapidly, and improved manufacturing practices will be key to establishing a reliable supply for the United States."

Continuous monitoring and determination of magnetic fields in beam lines are crucial. The major technical issue with current magnetic-field probes is the limited operation lifetime in high-radiation environments. Commonly used nuclear magnetic resonance probes tend to have lifetime of less than several weeks, limiting operational efficiency and increasing cost of operation. The development of a radiation-hard magnetic field probe offering prolonged operation over ~ 1 year is highly desirable. Hedgefog Research Inc. (HFR) is developing a Radiation Hardened Opto-atomic Magnetometer (RHOM) for magnetic-field sensing applications in high-radiation environments. This solution is a new approach to magnetometry that offers intrinsic radiation hardness guaranteed by design. The RHOM probe modules are built with radiation-hardened components, thereby offering a long, uninterrupted magnetic field sensing operation. HFR assembled and tested a compact probe prototype and confirmed that it can provide field measurement meeting the technical requirements of the application at high-energy target facilities. HFR established a data-acquisition and signal-processing scheme, which enables determination of the local magnetic flux density at the probe via comparison of experimental data with quantum- mechanical simulation results. HFR also performed radiation hardness testing of optical fiber in neutron-rich environments, which allows us to project operation lifetime of RHOM. Finally, HFR developed system design and down-selected system components for a RHOM prototype to be constructed in the next phase of the development. With the completion of the full technical feasibility demonstration achieved in Phase II, HFR plans to continue system integration, packaging, and software development in Phase IIA. HFR will construct and test an integrated prototype, which will include fully assembled probe and laser/control modules and allow fully automated magnetic-field sensing. HFR will also test the radiation hardness of the entire sensor module. The Phase IIA development will position HFR for technology transition and productization. Many high-radiation environments, including nuclear fusion reactors, accelerators, military/space applications, and high-energy physics laboratories, require magnetic-field sensors with long operation lifetime. A radiation-hard magnetic-field probe offering prolonged operation can replace the older sensors that limit operational efficiencies due to the short lifetime and suffer from catastrophic failures above device-specific damage thresholds, leading to abrupt interruption of the operation. The new solution will benefit users from many disciplines with direct commercial applications, including nuclear medicine and materials science."

For instance, in Nature, birds may fly in flocks and develop emergent behaviors that result in complex motions and interactions. Similarly, bacteria are active particles that can form assemblies such as bacterial biofilms that are known to play a major role in certain forms of cancer. Harnessing such properties is a long-standing challenge for the rational design of dynamic materials, that can respond to their environment, communicate with one another, and undergo a rapid, reversible, assembly through the transduction of energy. Recent developments in the design of smart and active colloidal building blocks have led to tremendous breakthroughs, with, for instance, the onset of synthetic photoactivated active assemblies known as “living crystals” that can form, break, explode and re-form elsewhere. The goal of this proposal is to develop a combined experimental, computational, and theoretical framework to shed light on the physical underpinnings of such assembly processes and program the assembly of smart active materials. Our recent work on equilibrium systems has shown that entropy is an efficient collective variable to measure how organized, or disorganized, a system can be. It also provides a great deal of information on the amount of energy that can flow into or out a given system. This approach can be readily extended to active assemblies, by applying, for instance, pattern recognition algorithms and machine learning methods. We also showed that nonequilibrium entropies can be calculated using compression algorithms. This method provides a nonequilibrium alternative to the Shannon entropy and is closely related to the algorithmic approach to information, known as Kolmogorov complexity. Our recent results provide a route to create colloidal building blocks with reconfigurable shapes and tailored functionalities. Indeed, chemical- and light-stimulated dewetting mechanisms can be used to synthesize particles that can swim and sense each other from self and cooperative phoresis, giving rise to “living crystals” and “rotors”. A novel aspect of our proposal will be the design of different active particles that act like controllable micron scale “robots”, not individually controllable but controllable collectively with lights and magnetic fields to form Turing patterns, swarm around objects they sense chemically, phoretically or magnetically or swarm into reconfigurable shapes. Our proposal relies on a closed loop approach that builds on our combined expertise and involves (i) the design of new colloidal building blocks that are shape-changing, reconfigurable, and light-activated dual-engine particles, whose state can be dynamically switched between swimming, spinning or inactive, (ii) the identification of the features of the assembly process through nonequilibrium particle-based computer simulations, specifically nonequilibrium Brownian dynamics, as well as simulations methods that couple the active colloidal building blocks to a Lattice-Boltzmann approach for the solvent and, in turn, account for hydrodynamics, (iii) deciphering the intelligence-information link by subjecting both experimental and simulation data on the formation of novel active assemblies to a Kolmogorov analog of the Turing test, and (iv) the use of machine (reinforcement) learning to control the assembly of active colloidal materials with the desired properties. Findings from this research will have wide-ranging implications for biomaterials, by providing new insights into active biological assembly, and in micro-robotics, by identifying novel strategies to design smart active materials."

Modern biological approaches, such as genetic engineering, can accelerate the establishment of biofuels crops in these soil environments of limited soil fertility. However, public opinion on genetic engineering remains an obstacle to the wide-scale adoption of this technology. Instead, traditional plant breeding methods rely on a slower pace of one breeding cycle per year to modify plant traits that would support growth on marginal lands. The recent focus on agricultural microbiomes could enhance the sustainability of biofuels cropping systems by enabling plants to access nutrients made available through biological fixation, mineralization, or solubilization. While some microbiome studies in development are focused on genetic engineering, the majority of research is conducted on natural communities of microbiomes that inhabit the soil ecosystem. There is a lack of technologies that measure in-situ microbial activity in the rhizosphere in real-time, limiting the progress on agricultural microbiomes research that is essential for a sustainable bioenergy program. This proposal develops an ultrasonic frequency as high as 2-3 GHz. At these frequencies, the resolution of imaging in soil can be as small as one-micron, enabling observation of single bacteria. Geegah has developed single-chip CMOS integrated imagers that integrate the ultrasonic transducers and the electronics for an ultracompact, non-optical, low power imager that can be wirelessly connected to the internet 40um resolution. A large field-of-view of 1x1cm will enable the imaging of biofilm formation in real-time, observing dynamical processes over days to months to years, without destructive removal of the soil and roots. The work will lead to an inexpensive multisensory imager that can image water content, microbiome activity though micro biofilm formation, chemical properties of the soil, root growth, and nematode pests near the surface of the sensor chip. We envision the geegah imagers, several tens of the imagers being used on a single plant to monitor the physiology and environmental variables, creating a tool that will become indispensable for plant research. We will commercialize the devices through laboratories, farm consultants, and eventually farms to monitor crop growth."

Stable quantum materials are expected to form the basis for quantum computing and secure communications, and are thus of great interest to the DoE. The synthetic requirements of growing bulk single crystals represent a major challenge for preparing potential quantum materials in this form. Unfortunately typical bulk magnetic crystals usually require high temperatures for growth. This can often lead to lattice defects and metal ion site disorder in the crystal framework. As part of a recent DoE BES funded project the Kolis group expanded its ability to grow crystals of refractory metal oxides in hydrothermal fluids at moderate temperatures and pressures. Under these conditions many otherwise recalcitrant metal oxides are solubilized sufficiently to react and form relatively large, high quality single crystals. This approach enabled the designed growth of targeted single crystals, including well-ordered spin-frustrated rare earth stannate and germanate pyrochlores. These results led to a new cooperative effort between the Kolis group and the Ross group at CSU, allowing cryogenic measurements of magnetic ordering and thermodynamic phase behavior. It also enabled single crystal neutron scattering measurements of frustrated magnetic systems. This preliminary data suggested that a number of the single crystals from this project could potentially display quantum phase behavior. The goal of this project will be to use precision synthesis of single crystals of rare earth oxides for cryogenic examination of magnetic phases and detailed single crystal neutron scattering studies. The target systems are rare earth oxides that contain ground states with effective spin =1/2 magnetic moments. The joint effort exploits two complementary skill sets that could enable the rational design of new quantum phases. The iterative and rational nature of the project could generate a wide range of potential quantum materials displaying a continuum of non-classical behaviors. The project represents an ideal confluence of two important vectors for the DoE Materials program, namely precision synthesis and quantum materials."
Nanopore Confinement of C-H-O Mixed-Volatile Fluids Relevant to Subsurface Energy Systems,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0006878,"Cole, David",David.Cole@theohiostateuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Project Abstract The overarching goal of this project is to use novel analytical, experimental, and computational approaches to quantify the effect of variable nanopore features (pore size, volume, topology, and chemistry) and the presence of water or salt solutions on the sorption and transport of carbon-bearing fluids. To achieve this goal in the final year of this effort, we will test two related hypotheses: (1) The transport of water and aqueous electrolytes in nanopores is controlled by pore size, pore wall composition, and the type of salt – structure-maker (e.g., CaCl2) versus structure-breaker (e.g., NaCl) that affect the hydrogen-bonding network. (2) The structure, solubility, and transport of carbon-bearing molecules in water or aqueous electrolyte-filled nanopores are controlled by the substrate type including degree of hydration, and pore features, and regulated by the hydration structure of the guest molecules. A scientifically diverse, multi-institutional team (Ohio State University, Oklahoma University, University College London, Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research, Oak Ridge National Lab) has used novel experimental and analytical techniques in concert with state-of-the-art molecular simulations to address these two areas. We have leveraged the synergistic links established between neutron scattering and NMR experiments already integrated into our research portfolio with molecular-level simulations. The focus is decidedly on the storage capacity and transport behavior of carbon fluids in the presence or absence of either water or electrolyte solutions in nanoporous matrices exhibiting variable pore features (e.g., pore size, volume, and topology). The results have important implications for understanding water-gas-rock interactions relevant to geoscience ‘compartments’ such as deep sedimentary basins, tight gas shale, geologic CO2 storage, and contaminants derived from energy exploitation. Additionally, this project is designed to provide valuable fundamental insights into interfacial process relevant to various aspects of the Clean Energy-Water nexus. In terms of roles and responsibilities, PI David Cole is the overall Point of Contact for the project. He will coordinate the completion of data assessment and modeling among the partnering institutions (OSU, OU, KISR, and ORNL). Research Associate Dr. Siddharth Gautam will lead the effort to connect neutron scattering results (quasielastic neutron scattering – QENS) with complementary molecular simulations (GCMC and MD). The no-cost collaboration with Prof. Alberto Striolo and his groups at Oklahoma University and University College London will help connect molecular-level simulations with experimental neutron scattering results. Former postdoc, Dr. Salim Ok (Kuwait Inst. for Scientific Research) will complete assessment of NMR experiments at no-cost. No-cost collaboration with Drs. G. Rother and E Mamontov at ORNL will contribute to data processing of neutron scattering experiments."

To this end, new methods for multitemporal processing of large InSAR datasets will be developed. These include implementing novel approaches for integrating coupled poroelastic models into InSAR deformation time series analysis. The obtained deformation time series will be used to constrain hydrogeological properties of the medium and resolve the evolution of crustal stresses as a result of fluid injection. Having the time-variable models of stress changes, a statistical framework will be implemented to estimate large earthquakes' time-dependent probability on the surrounding fault systems. These data and models help to improve seismic hazard estimates and aid in constructing operational induced earthquake forecast models. This information can also be integrated into the updated U.S. National Seismic Hazard Map used by local communities and authorities in their earthquake risk estimates and earthquake risk mitigation effort. Intellectual Merit: Disposal of saltwater, which is produced with oil and gas, is linked to elevated seismicity in the central and Midwest U.S. There is a concern that these events may lead to widespread damage and an overall increase in seismicity. Thus an improved understanding of the spatially and temporally varying deformation and stress field associated with fluid injection operation is critically important for evaluating temporally variable seismic hazard. The proposed research effort will comprehensively analyze, integrate, and interpret geodetic, injection, and seismic data in the vicinity of Oklahoma's injection sites. Joint inverse modeling of the InSAR and injection data will be used to resolve the 4-dimensional distribution of pore pressure and stress in the shallow crust. This project, in particular, is focused on exploring the statistical relation between injection operation, surface deformation, and increased earthquake hazard. The pore pressure change is tied to the rocks' hydrogeological properties, such as diffusivity, and the proposed activity can also evaluate the first-order rock properties. Broader Impact: Results from this work will allow us to assess the role of fluid injection in earthquake occurrence and clustering. Long-term economic and societal benefits might ultimately arise from an improved understanding of the pore pressure distribution, its relation to local stress anomalies, and improved models of the earthquake probability that should improve earthquake forecasts and intermediate predictions. This project will provide full support for a graduate student and a postdoc. PI Shirzaei will incorporate issues and results from this work in his undergraduate teaching, including Physical Geology (this course includes sections on earthquake hazard and seismicity), as well as a graduate course, Crustal Deformation, and Remote Sensing, which includes numerous case examples from the seismically active fault zones and injection sites."

Ionizing radiation increases noise in the experiments, making it harder to distinguish actual events from background and lengthening, in some cases dramatically, the amount of time needed to for data collection. To address this issue, methods of manufacturing “radiopure” cabling/electronics have been the subject of intense R+D. In this approach, radioactive contaminants are either systematically and rigorously excluded (by careful selection of raw materials) or eliminated post facto (by cleaning and/or advanced industrial processing). The figure of merit for radiopurity is the presence, in parts per trillion, of the two most serious radioactive contaminants 238U and 232Th and their progeny. While progress has been made, a vetted, scalable and commercially implementable “best practices” method for manufacturing radiopure cabling/electronics has yet to be fully demonstrated. In Phase I we investigated production of ultra-low radioactivity flexible cables and circuitry. Specifically, we systematically determined and eliminated sources of contamination in our production process, and studied alternative methods—such as new cleaning chemicals—to minimize radioactivity in the cabling. A reduction in the presence of the radioactive elements 238U and 232Th by a factor of > 25x and > 10x, respectively, was demonstrated by state-of-the-art plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) testing at PNNL. Phase II will continue the work begun in Phase I by accomplishing three principal Aims: Aim I: Continue the work done in Phase I by studying those cable production steps that were identified as being significant sources of contamination. Optimize the Q-Flex cable production process to minimize overall radioactive contamination. Significantly, in this Aim we will for the first time employ germanium detection to determine the presence of any radioactive progeny along with via ICP-MS the level of 238U and 232Th in ppt. Aim II: Using the “best practices” radiopurity process optimized in Aim I, produce a test batch of 10 x prototype cables, suitable for use on nEXO and LEGEND particle detection projects. Aim III: Scale up to produce a working set (N = 100) customized radiopure cables suitable for use on the nEXO project. Development of radiopure manufacturing is expected to have strong commercial benefits as well. For example, ionizing radiation is also deleterious to advanced semiconductor fabrication. Similarly, the role of ionizing radiation in limiting the performance of quantum computers is just being appreciated. Phase II will fully establish a robust and reliable method for producing radiopure cables and circuitry which can then be immediately employed to aid the search for neutrino less double beta decay as well as other low-background applications such as dark matter searches. Upon vertical integration of a vetted manufacturing process, we also anticipate significant commercial benefits in the sale of radiopure products into established QFlex customers in the semiconductor and quantum computing sectors."
Experimental and Computational Study of Quantum Nuclear and Many-Body Effects in Water Network Formation and Water-Surface Interaction in PAH-Water Cluster Ions,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021387,"Weber, J. Mathias",J. Mathias.Weber@theregentsoftheuniversityofcoloradod/b/auniversityofcolorado,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","The proposed research will employ a combined experimental and theoretical approach to quantify interactions between water molecules and aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at an unprecedented level of detail. Molecular clusters are excellent systems for theoretical and computational work, since they are sufficiently small for high-accuracy electronic structure calculations. At the same time, the precise control over experimental conditions in cryogenic cluster ion experiments, both through mass selection and cooling, dramatically reduces systematic uncertainties compared to analogous condensed phase work. Crucially, quantum nuclear effects that arise from non- classical, quantum behavior of protons in water often display modest effects in bulk liquid at room temperature. These effects are expected to be more pronounced in small water-PAH clusters, particularly at low temperature. Thus, the proposed systems will allow us to explore several different treatments for including quantum nuclear and many-body effects. PAHs are valuable model systems for both neutral and charged graphene and their chemical derivatives. The water-graphene interaction is of paramount importance in materials chemistry. Theoretical predictions and careful experiments have shown that the graphene wetting characteristics are highly sensitive to small changes in the chemistry on the graphene surface. For example, application of small voltages applied to nanoporous graphene are predicted to increase water throughput in desalination applications, and the predicted water transport through such systems strongly depends on the details of the model for water-carbon interaction used. This implies that applications ranging from battery technology to electrocatalysis depend on interfacial phenomena that contemporary theoretical models only poorly describe. Experimentally probing the molecular level details of the interaction of single-layer graphene with water is also rather challenging, due to pitfalls in the preparation of clean single-layer graphene films and the size and shape heterogeneity of graphenic nanostructures synthesized in typical chemical preparations. We will study the interaction of water molecules with charged PAHs in mass selected cluster ions of the form PAH+/-?(H2O)n, using cryogenic infrared photodissociation spectroscopy, and compare the experimental results with theoretical predictions. From an experimental point of view, using mass-selected PAH ions allows us to precisely control the size and shape of the graphenic system, as well as the number of water molecules interacting with it. This strategy leads to exquisitely well-controlled experimental conditions, because it removes fluctuations in the solvent environment and lets us study solvent interactions one molecule at a time. While this general strategy has been applied to many molecular systems, only recent advances in cryogenic ion spectroscopy allow us now to systematically investigate hydrated PAH cluster ions, particularly for larger PAHs and beyond ca. 5 water molecules. We will parameterize the many-body intermolecular potential, and test both centroid and ring- polymer molecular dynamics approximations to relevant quantum time correlation functions associated with transitions between stable structures of the clusters and IR spectroscopy. The many-body potentials will be released as part of publicly available software package, maintained by Sandia National Labs, for molecular dynamics simulations."

The challenge is that the relevant theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), cannot be solved using the same mathematical techniques which are successful in describing the rest of the Standard Model. Rather a numerical approach, known as Lattice QCD is required, and it is the application of this technique to the question of the internal structure of hadrons that is the subject of this project. Some of the lightest hadrons observed experimentally are also the least well understood — notably the sigma and kappa states. By combining the tool of dispersion relations, which have proven successful in pinning down the sigma and kappa when applied to experimental data, with lattice QCD, we develop an understanding of how these enigmatic particles change as the mass of the quarks is adjusted. The first lattice QCD studies of highly excited mesons as resonances decaying into several possible configurations of lighter mesons are carried out, with the aim of clarifying a number of confusing situations where experimental data does not agree with otherwise successful models. By coupling excited mesons to currents, the probability distribution of quarks inside them is probed, potentially addressing the question of whether certain states are small, tightly bound objects, or large ""molecules"" built out of smaller mesons. The project provides a theoretical angle on the contemporary experimental work being done at for example COMPASS and LHCb at CERN, BES III in Beijing, and GlueX and CLAS at Jefferson Lab."

Presently available methods for monitoring biodiversity trends are outdated and expensive. New methods are needed that are more efficient and less costly. Reducing these costs is of interest to the Department of Energy and the general public as a means to reduce overall biofuel production costs and environmental impacts, thereby providing a cost-effective and relatively clean alternative to fossil fuels. A substantial proportion of present and proposed biofuel production operations are terrestrially based, but the environmental impacts wash down the watershed into the aquatic ecosystem. Biodiversity monitoring can therefore be efficiently focused on surface waters draining the watershed, but it is first necessary to develop modern sampling methods to collect data on biodiversity trends in aquatic environments. The project objective is to modernize methods for identification and enumeration of ecological indicator organisms sampled from aquatic environments by advancing the design and operational range of an optical image acquisition and classification system. This is being accomplished by designing, building and testing the system components, including the imager, sampling equipment, and software, within the context of customer needs. Phase I advanced the prototype imaging unit, developed novel sampling designs for surface waters such as streams and lakes, evaluated approaches to configure an instrument that can be used in the field or lab, and conducted interviews with potential customers to ensure compatibility between design and need. An initial prototype imaging unit will be completed during this project phase, and equipment to collect samples and deliver them through the imaging unit have been designed, built, and tested. Interviews with potential customers revealed that biological sensing systems are the “holy grail” of environmental sensing, with substantial support for a relatively inexpensive system that can integrate with data from other sensors in an easy-to-use package. During the next project phase, system hardware development and testing will continue, the manufacturing design of system components finalized, the control and classification software advanced using deep-learning programming, a cloud-based image library implemented, and a most-viable-product cooperatively tested with early adopters, resulting in a system with cost and performance features that ensure customer acceptance. Waterways are monitored nationwide to characterize biodiversity trends. Thousands of industries, government agencies, and commercial organizations conduct sampling and are willing to pay for a cheaper, faster method. Optical imaging meets this need. The biofuel industry will benefit from reduced costs. The public will benefit from better understanding of biodiversity trends. Economically, the environmental sampling industry is growing at 10% annually, ensuring financial viability of this endeavor."

AUVs are particularly useful as unmanned survey platforms, and typically have an array of on-board sensors to collect data for a variety of commercial and military applications. AUVs are autonomous and untethered systems and require a power source, typically batteries, to be carried onboard. An increase in available energy by even a small amount can be game-changing for AUV applications with benefits including longer mission durations, higher sampling rate, more sensing capability, and improved communication capability. The problem of finite battery life can be addressed by allowing the AUV to extract energy from its surrounding environment and eliminating the need to recover the vehicle until the mission is complete. This project aims to develop a system that will recharge the AUV using the energy in ocean waves. Such a system integrated into commercial AUVs represents a potentially game-changing opportunity. In the Phase 1 project, OPI demonstrated in the laboratory a working concept that will allow a small AUV to recharge its batteries using ocean waves. Importantly, this concept is self-contained and requires no external infrastructure to operate, allowing the AUV complete freedom to operate. Furthermore, the proposed approach is scalable and adaptable and can potentially be applied to any AUV. In the proposed Phase II program, OPI will further develop the Wave Power Charging System (WPCS) concept, adding custom control electronics, firmware and improving the mechanical design for real-world use. OPI has teamed with Lockheed Martin to apply system this to one of their commercial A-Class AUVs. The enhanced AUV will then be tested in operational conditions in the open ocean. The addition of a self-recharging capability to ocean observing vehicles can make a meaningful impact on their performance by extending mission duration and improving sensing capability. In addition to improving the capabilities of the growing ocean observing space, this can help open up wave energy as a viable new renewable energy source, resulting in new high-paying manufacturing jobs."

Quantitative energetic properties, including bond energies, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and Brønsted and Lewis acidities and basicities will be predicted to provide insights into molecular structure, bonding, chemical stability, and reactivity. Using high level theoretical approaches with a careful treatment of all important effects including spin-orbit coupling, it is now possible to computationally study molecules for all of the elements through Z = 103, to chemical accuracy (< 1 kcal/mol for main group compounds and < 3 kcal/mol for compounds containing metals). One goal is to use such approaches to tackle a core area of actinide chemistry (anions, cations, and the corresponding neutrals), notably the maximum oxidation state that actinides can attain. Close collaborations are planned with experimental efforts including: (1) the Kit Bowen group (Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University) on actinide anions and the corresponding neutrals; (2) the Michael Duncan group (Chemistry, University of Georgia) on actinide cationic clusters and the corresponding neutrals; (3) the groups of Karah Knope (Chemistry, Georgetown University) and Richard Wilson (Argonne National Laboratory) on the structure, energetics and spectra of actinide complexes to gain an understanding of the role of counterions that are intimately involved with the actinide complex in the first and second shells to learn how nanoparticles form; and with John Gibson (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on hydrolysis and ligand exchange reactions involving small actinide anions and cations. Studies of the structures and properties of (AnOx)n and mixed (AnOy(OH)z)n ultra-small nanoclusters will be continued to examine how these ultra-small nanoclusters can be transformed not ony by hydrolysis (reaction with H2O) and by carbonation (reaction with CO2). We will predict the acidities in the gas phase and in aqueous solution (pKa’s) of Ann+ (for the common oxidation states, n = III, IV), AnO2+ and AnO22+ and determine the actual size of the first solvation shell. These are the first steps in determining how an Ann+(H2O)m cluster sheds positive charge so that condensation processes can occur leading to aggregation which is an important effect in fuels and waste. These results in combination with experimental studies and other computational work supported by the DOE complex will expand our understanding of the chemistry of the actinide period and provide the basis upon which to build the science underpinning future nuclear energy technologies."

R. Greer, California Institute of Technology (Principal Investigator) Abstract/Overview Progress in additive manufacturing (AM) at increasingly smaller length-scales has given rise to materials with novel properties and functionalities. Simple material building units with micron- and sometimes sub-micron dimensions, like beams or shells, can be constructed into complex three-dimensional geometries that can elicit an unbounded realm of material behavior. The global, bulk-level mechanical behavior of some additively manufactured structures, particularly in metals, has been explored in reported literature, but none properly describing or quantifying microstructural complexities of AM-produced metals or of capturing the relationship between the mechanical properties and the microstructure of these metals at the local length-scales. An especially unknown aspect of mechanical behavior of chemically-produced metals is the relationship between their microstructural parameters (grain size and distribution, purity, porosity, defects, etc.) and the measured mechanical properties (tensile and compressive yield strength, hardening, elongation to failure, etc.). These entities are intimately linked together through mechanical deformation mechanisms, which arise as a result of complex interplay among microstructural detail. The key objective of this proposal is to conduct fundamental research to uncover the mechanical deformation and failure mechanisms in metals that are simultaneously nanocrystalline and nano-porous. This hierarchical and complex microstructure evolves as a result of the proposed additive manufacturing of sub-micron-sized metals. We aim to uncover the origins of strength and deformation in nano-sized, chemically-derived metals (Ni and Cu) to gain fundamental understanding of their compressive and tensile strength, deformability, and failure mechanisms, as a function of underlying microstructure, intrinsic (i.e. grain and pore size) and extrinsic (i.e. sample dimensions) length scales, and chemical composition. The focus of this work is on the development of a mechanistically accurate paradigm for the understanding and characterizing the link between mechanical properties and microstructure evolution in chemically synthesized nanocrystalline metals. The model metals chosen for this fundamental study are Cu and Ni because of substantial existing literature on the mechanical behavior and microstructure of these metals in their nanocrystalline form as a means of comparison and benchmarking. Some key features of this work include the development of novel methods for the synthesis and of the (nano)mechanical experiments on on additively manufactured nanocrystalline metals, as well as conducting thorough microstructural and chemical characterization of these materials. This approach overcomes the inherent ambiguities associated with using the Focused Ion Beam (FIB) to study mechanical behavior of small-scale metallic samples because it alters surface energy state and offers control and versatility of the grain-level and defect-level microstructures. We propose to probe microstructure-driven internal energy landscape of metals that are produced using chemical synthesis of metal ion-containing resins followed by thermal treatment and link them to the mechanical deformation mechanism and properties. Our experimental approach will focus on synthesis and characterization of small-scale nanocrystalline and nanoporous Ni and Cu samples with different grain sizes and porosities that are amenable to in-situ mechanical experiments. Sample geometries will be cylindrical to explicitly examine the interplay between important length scales/phenomena during deformation. This work provides stress-strain behavior as a function of competing intrinsic (grain size and porosity) and extrinsic (sample dimensions) length scales and real-time observations of overall sample deformation morphology prior to, during, and post-testing. Our efforts will focus primarily on determining yield strength, plastic flow, and failure mechanisms as a function of grain size, distribution of pores and defects, and external sample dimensions. Developing a fundamental scientific understanding of the link between material microstructure generated through chemical synthesis and additive manufacturing and measurable mechanical properties is critical. A successful execution of this proposal will produce new fundamental knowledge about novel mechanical behavior mechanisms made available by chemical synthesis of nanocrystalline metals."
Discovery of Dielectric Response and Forces in Sub-Nanoscale Objects,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0005132,"Bartynski, Robert","Robert.Bartynski@rutgers,thestateuniversityofnewjersey","['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","This project seeks to explore the dynamic dielectric response of nano-scale structures in time and space, using inelastic scattering of an Angstrom-sized swift electron beam. When a kilo-volt electron passes very close to a nano-scale structure in an electron microscope, it delivers an electromagnetic pulse whose width can be as short as a few atto-seconds. This pulse transfers energy and induces forces in the structure, resulting in charge movement, structural changes, and sometimes movement of the whole structure. Information about the energy transfer, which is accessible in the Electron Energy Loss Spectrum in a modern transmission electron microscope, is not limited to energy spectra, but in principle also contains the phase relationships of the various spectral peaks, which can be extracted using Causality constraints. The existence of this phase information should allow the time evolution of specimen behavior to be obtained using Fourier Transform techniques. This project explores methods to obtain this time-resolved, dielectric response in interesting nano-scale structures. The time scales to be addressed range from a few atto-seconds, limited by the time for the swift electron to pass through or near the nano-scale structure, through femto-second times for optical excitations, to pico-second times for vibrational modes. These studies will aim to explore how particular excitations evolve in time and how they couple to other specimen properties. PI will apply these ideas to explore native defects and atomic clusters incorporated within different types of thin substrates, including graphene. Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy using Angstrom-level beams and high energy resolution will obtain spatially resolved dielectric losses. Calculations will be used to increase understanding the near- and far-field dielectric response, to estimate resulting inter- and intra-object forces, and to deduce the time dependent response at atto-second and slower time scales. A detailed understanding of the time-dependent dielectric response of nano-scale objects will contribute to many activities in materials physics, chemistry and biology. For instance, measurement of coupling to external electric fields in molecule-particle systems will improve understanding of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering. Estimation of inter-particle forces will enhance our understanding of van der Waals fluctuation forces in complicated shapes, and may therefore contribute to a better understanding of molecular self-assembly. Measurements of dielectric response in hybrid inorganic/organic systems will aid understanding of collective effects in arrays of quantum confined objects, and the far-field coupling of those systems with light. Finally, excitation of nano-scale metal structures under non-dipole conditions, produced by the close approach of a very small electron beam, may provide new information about surface and bulk plasmon behavior, suggesting new methods for manipulating light at the nano-scale, and for design of light harvesting devices for future sources of energy."

It is the basis of photosynthesis, in which light absorption results in the separation of charge that ultimately creates the chemical potential needed to drive ATP synthesis; an advantageous by-product of this process is, of course, O2 production. The energy flux hitting the Earth is 120,000 TW: integrated over a 24-hour period, this translates to humankind’s total energy budget for an entire year. There is a need for continued research in solar energy conversion science. Fundamental research on solar energy conversion – which will ultimately lead to the next generation of solar energy technologies – has sought to replicate Nature’s solution through the creation of artificial constructs that mimic various aspect of photosynthesis. Indeed, the prospect of direct solar-to-fuel conversion represents one of the most promising pathways for carbon-neutral energy that can be scaled in a way not possible with other renewable energy sources. Whether it’s the creation of potential gradients to generate current (i.e., photovoltaics) or more recent efforts to couple photo-excited species to catalysts for chemical conversion (e.g., reduction of protons to hydrogen), the critical first step is the absorption of light and the subsequent separation of charge. When considering large-scale (i.e., global) implementation of any solar energy conversion scheme, material availability becomes a critically important consideration in the light-capture part of the problem. Unfortunately, virtually all of the molecule-based approaches for solar energy conversion that have been proven successful rely on some of the least abundant elements on earth. The proposed research program focuses on the development of chromophores based on first-row transition metal ions for use as light harvesting components in solar energy conversion. The underlying motivation stems from the aforementioned issue of scalability and the limited potential of traditional second- and third-row chromophores to fill this void due to their elemental scarcity. A key scientific issue impeding the incorporation of most first-row metal complexes into light conversion strategies is the rapid deactivation of charge-transfer states to lower-lying, metal-centered ligand-field states. This behavior stands in stark contrast to what is observed for their second- and third-row congeners and renders the first-row analogs largely ineffectual for virtually any application reliant on the separation of charge. Our research program is therefore directed at obtaining a fundamental understanding of the nature and origin(s) of these dynamics through a confluence of synthetic chemistry, a range of steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopies – particularly on ultrafast time scales – as well as theory, and to use that knowledge toward the realization of approaches that mitigate and/or circumvent these challenges. The program consists of three, interrelated research efforts. The dynamics of charge transfer-state relaxation can be viewed from the perspective of evolution along a reaction coordinate that couples the charge-transfer and ligand-field electronic-state manifolds, or in terms of the relative energies of the electronic excited states involved. The first two research threads are built around these conceptual frameworks , the first with the goal of identifying the specific structural dynamics that are coupled to the MLCT-to-LF conversion process sufficient to create guidelines for the manipulation of ultrafast dynamics through synthetic design, and the second involving the exploitation of new chemistry that will allow us to prepare Fe(II)-based chromophores characterized by an energetic inversion of the charge-transfer and ligand-field excited states with significant tunability that will be under synthetic control. Finally, we will expand on a new research effort involving the study of the photophysics of Co(III) complexes. Preliminary results suggest that, in contrast to Fe(II) systems, the ligand field-state dynamics of Co(III) polypyridyls may be occurring in the Marcus inverted region: if confirmed, this would represent a new paradigm in the photophysics of first-row metal complexes. This will comprise the first concerted effort in the study of the ultrafast dynamics of Co(III) complexes and will, we believe, provide fundamental new insights into the photo-induced properties of first-row d6 metal complexes with an eye toward expanding their functionality for applications in energy science"

A roadmap to this approach requires a new structure of engagement between those established in the field and minority students and their mentors. Moreover, this path demands removal of barriers that persistently resisted the success of African American students, such as financial hardships. This program takes an innovative approach in facilitating a change in climate for less-served participants who will culturally broaden and diversify the nuclear physics community. North Carolina Central University (NCCU), a consortium member of the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) and ranked by US News and World Report, the 11th Best HBCU to attend in the country will lead the traineeship program. The proposed southeastern regional traineeship program will create opportunities for engaging students and faculty from three HBCUs, NCCU, Fisk University, and Florida Memorial University, in a symbiotic relationship with TUNL consortium research universities: Duke University, NC State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The geographical proximity of the HBCUs with the TUNL consortium institutions will make frequent in-person interactions convenient promoting engagement between TUNL faculty and the participating students and their home-institution faculty mentors. The regional character of this pilot program enables the students and their faculty mentors to have a presence at TUNL research facilities and at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) working in TUNL research groups on neutrino physics and fundamental symmetries projects. The underlying intent of on-site lab activities, opportunities for group mentoring, and ongoing discussions among faculty and students is to foster a sense of belonging and reduce barriers to inclusion. The program provides opportunities for students to showcase their work and network with other physicists in the region at meetings including the South-Eastern Section of the American Physical Society (SESAPS). Furthermore, the regional program will leverage the existing research infrastructure of TUNL, projects at ORNL and international research collaborations to train students in scientific areas and technical skills relevant to the research portfolio in programs at the Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Physics (DOE/NP) and to build sustainable education pipelines between HBCUs and graduate physics programs at the TUNL universities. The proposed program has five active engagement components: recruitment, mentoring, research experience, professional development, and assessment. These objectives are outlined below. The students in the program will be recruited as a cohort of eight participants in each of the two years of the pilot program. Students in the cohort will select a field of study from the research portfolio of TUNL faculty mentors, including low-energy nuclear physics, fundamental symmetries, neutrino physics, accelerator physics, and applications of nuclear physics. The mentors will collaborate with faculty supervisors at the traineeship partner institutions to sustain research involvement during the academic year and to prepare the students for research during the summers. This pre-summer engagement will crescendo at the on-site summer program where the trainees and mentors come together to work on their research projects and professional development. The summer research experience will provide a space for inclusion, fostering of physics identity, and developing technical and soft skills for careers in physics. The impact of the program on the participants’ attitudes about science, physics, and nuclear physics, and the progress towards reaching the goals of the traineeship program will be measured using evaluation instruments. A scaled-up model of the proposed program has the capacity to change the perceptions of African American students about careers in physics and help them overcome stereotypes about who can become a physicist."

This microscopy technique is poised to have a leading role in future structural characterization efforts of relevant samples in next-generation electronic and energy storage devices that increasingly rely on small complex 3D geometries to push performance to the next level. Only when one can characterize the materials in 3D space can one understand and optimize their performance as well as the processes that are used to fabricate them. At present, the current limiting factor in the speed and quality of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) tomographic reconstructions is the total runout in the tilt axes on modern transmission electron microscopes. As a result, for every tilt step, one must correct for sample shift, which makes tomographic dataset collection a slow and tedious process. The built-in microscope stage (side-entry goniometer) was simply not designed with the specifications needed to produce high- resolution 3D tomograms quickly and repeatably. Slow acquisition also results in unnecessarily high electron doses which can result in damage to the specimen under observation. In Phase I of this SBIR, Hummingbird Scientific has prototyped a fast, concentric moving (low runout) dedicated tomography sample stage that we intend to commercialize as a replacement internal stage product for any TEM. We have successfully demonstrated the advantages of this approach by retrofitting a working transmission electron microscope with our prototype in Phase I. In Phase II, Hummingbird will design, manufacture, assemble, and beta test this internal tomography stage with a tomography sample loading system and control interface for collecting 180-degree tomograms. The final target is to be able to collect a full tomogram in 60 seconds. Our tomography stage product will take full advantage of the current generation of high-frame- rate electron detectors to collect data of sufficiently high quality as the sample rotates. We will leverage the internal capabilities at Hummingbird Scientific to engineer, build, and test this tomography stage system and to develop the commercial product proposed in this project. We have added a second TEM in our facility dedicated for TEM stage work to enable our technicians to perform routine assembly and testing work on TEM columns to support this project. Materials research groups focused on studying the 3D structure of nano-scale materials would be the main customer of this product. We plan to be in beta testing this product and collecting scientifically relevant data to be used in marketing activities by the end of Phase II."

The current limitation of existing measurement tools is in the constraints of streak cameras. An ultrafast pixel camera can meet these needs by reading high-speed photodetectors and sensor arrays with compact electronics. Such an approach would facilitate transformative diagnostics at many DOE labs. NSL proposes to continue R&D design and commercialization plans for an Ultrafast Pixel Array Camara (UPAC) through this Phase II effort. This novel solid-state sensor will be capable of digitally recording x-ray, and particle emission from High Energy Density and Inertial Fusion plasmas with thousands of pixel resolution, burst mode frame rates of 10-100 Giga Frames per Second, and record lengths up to 1000 time samples. Through the Phase I efforts, Nalu LLC developed the UPAC-I, a 32 channel low profile digitizer board with the PSEC4A digitizer chip. UPAC-I was developed in close collaboration with scientists at Sandia National Laboratories and the University of Chicago. UPAC-I has been fabricated and is under electronic and lab testing. During Phase I we identified specifications for the readout chip for a Phase II project. The next step is to connect this board with specialized x-ray and neutron sensor arrays which will be completed before the end of this project. The proposed two-year Phase II project will be focused on the following: Finalize field-testing of the UPAC-I 32 channel system at high-power laser facilities, design and implement a high channel count version UPCA-Eval (96 channels), test UPAC-Eval camera in HEDP and ICF experiments at high-power laser and pulsed-power facilities, from specifications derived from Phase I, design and implement the building block digitizer microchip, develop easy-to-use evaluation board and software for early tests by end-users, develop and build electronics, pixelated x-ray, and particle sensor arrays for a 400 and 100 channel camera, test the UPCAC-400/100l camera at various collaborator’s facilities. This device can be used by scientists in high energy and nuclear physics experiments to assess plasma conditions. NSL will develop the UPAC as a commercially available camera with a common knowledge base. Accompanying hardware, firmware, and software can be deployed in a variety of experiments and applications from massive projects such as those at the National Ignition Facility, subcritical experiments at the Nevada National Security Site, or Laser Energetics experiments at various DOE labs. We anticipate being able to sell the device as an original equipment manufacturer, while providing associated design services and support, and/or license it to a larger device manufacturer. The low unit cost and low-power nature of the design will give us a competitive edge."
A New Medium Field Superconducting Magnet for the EIC,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0021578,"Gupta, Ramesh","Ramesh.Gupta@particlebeamlasers,inc.","['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","A New Medium Field Superconducting Magnet for the EIC-Particle Beam Lasers, Inc., 8800 Melissa Court, Waxahachie, TX 75167-2807 Ramesh Gupta, Principal Investigator, gupta@bnl.gov Delbert Larson, Business Official, delbert_larson@yahoo.com Amount: $1,150,000 Research Institution Brookhaven National Laboratory The length of most accelerator magnets is much greater than the diameter, and therefore the loss in effective length from the ends (about a coil diameter in dipoles) is relatively small. However, for short magnets, such as some envisioned for the Interaction Region (IR) of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC), the end effects of the conventional cosine theta design will result in a relatively large reduction in magnetic length. This proposal is for developing an alternate optimum integral design which significantly reduces the loss of effective length due to the ends. In the optimum integral design approach, the ends become an integral part of the magnet in optimizing the cosine theta current distribution, thereby creating a higher integral field for the same coil length. The more compact design is critical when available space is limited as in the EIC. As a part of Phase I, we ported and further developed the codes for optimizing the optimum integral design. The lower cost of direct wind technology allowed us to design, build, and successfully test a proof-of-principle 1.7 T, 114 mm aperture, 600 mm long, 2-layer superconducting dipole based on the optimum integral design, a significant feat for a Phase I program. The goal of Phase II will be to demonstrate the optimum integral design for EIC IR dipole B0ApF. This will be a 3.8 T, 114 mm aperture, 600 mm long superconducting dipole, which is well beyond what has been demonstrated with direct wind technology so far. The magnet will also meet the field quality requirements. It is an ambitious goal for an SBIR/STTR program but one that we believe can be achieved based on the strong performance of Phase I. Finally, we will examine the applicability of the optimum integral design to other EIC magnets and for other applications, such as medical and accelerator beam lines where compact, medium field superconducting magnets are required. A direct wind magnet based on the optimum integral design will create higher quality fields and have lower adverse end effects than conventional designs making it ideal for uses wherein space is at a premium. Demonstration of the direct wind magnet based on the optimum integral design is expected to provide a superior technical solution and reduce the cost of developing and building such magnets. These magnets should find widespread use in particle accelerators for research and medical applications."

We evaluated several scalable neuromorphic techniques to detect and predict cybersecurity threats, compared full precision machine learning models with neuromorphic models and developed an end-to-end Proof of Concept (POC). Upon completion of Phase 2 prototype, we will produce dramatic reductions in latency and power--up to 100x--without sacrificing accuracy. This will enable quicker response times and savings in operating costs. Cyber-NeuroRT will be a real-time neuromorphic processor-based monitoring tool to predict and alert cybersecurity threats and warnings using the Neuromorphic Platforms of Intel Loihi 1 and BrainChip Akida. For our Phase 1 POC development, we used 450,000 Zeek log entries with a mixture of normal and malicious data for training the supervised ML models. As part of our study, we covered the following: Cyber Attack types covered – 8 attack types: backdoor, DDOS, DOS, injection, password, ransomware, scanning and XSS, Source files – Zeek log files and Packet Capture Format files (PCAP) containing both malicious and normal records. We used both Supervised and Unsupervised algorithms. We used algorithms including SNN and CNN-to-SNN conversion with unsupervised learning and supervised learning rules. To build a full-fledged prototype of Cyber-Neuro RT, we plan to transition the proof-of-concept work to scale to a large data set with additional threat types and other datasets from an HPC environment. HPC environments operate at larger scales than traditional IT domains and our solution should be able to monitor and predict events at more than 160,000 inferences per second. Tuning of Spike Neural Networks (SNN) parameters such as precision of weights and number of neurons used are two software parameters to explore. The chip can be tuned between high v. low power modes and performance can be studied as a function of power draw. Evaluation will be performed across a variety of datasets and parameter settings to estimate deployment performance. We will work on efficiency scaling of SNN algorithms in terms of accuracy and hardware metrics like power and energy consumption. Since cybersecurity attack classification is a temporal process, we will leverage recent advancements in the algorithm community to map temporal dynamics of SNNs to recurrent architectures. Further, to adapt to novel attack vectors, we will explore unsupervised learning techniques in a dynamic network architecture where we will grow or shrink the network as and when novel attack vectors arise. We will also perform an algorithm-hardware co-design analysis by ensuring that our algorithm proposals cater to and consider specific constraints from Akida or Loihi processors like network size, bit quantization levels, among others. 3.1 Some of the features of Cyber-NeuroRT prototype shall include: Ability to monitor, predict and provide system wide alerts of impending cybersecurity threats and warnings at scale by collecting and prioritizing data from Zeek logs and PCAP files streamed in real-time or batch. We will expand and refine different training techniques like CNN to SNN conversion, direct backpropagation training through surrogate gradient methods or local unsupervised Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) enabled approaches. Compare performance of threat detection between neuromorphic processing vs GPU-based systems and compare between Akida and Intel Loihi processors.

Its emissions to the atmosphere are extremely heterogeneous in space and time. Novel approaches to characterize such heterogeneity for incorporation into models and to identify effective mitigation strategies are greatly needed. Commercial instruments for flux measurement of CH4 are available and have been deployed in global measurement campaigns such as FLUXNET. However, similar instruments for nitrous oxide do not exist, as it presents greater measurement challenges. Southwest Sciences, Inc. is addressing this need through an intensive program of further development, field testing, and commercialization of low power laser-based systems that measure nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide emissions. The instruments developed in this project will allow accurate, simultaneous measurements of greenhouse gas emissions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales in a robust, low-power field package. The Phase I effort demonstrated that our nitrous oxide gas analyzer technology can be packaged into a compact, low power, light weight system that can run on battery power for extended times for use at remote study sites. Field tests demonstrated that the gas analyzer performance provides the speed and resolution required for eddy covariance flux determinations and, when combined with a sonic anemometer, provides data that can be processed to provide meaningful flux values. In Phase II, modifications that will allow the system to run unattended for longer periods of time while logging data to an onboard data storage device will be made. In addition, a new gas multigas analyzer that will simultaneously measure nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide in a single instrument will be developed and field tested. Commercial instruments for measuring nitrous oxide fluxes and for measuring nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide simultaneously are envisioned. The technology could be widely applied across existing and future FLUXNET, AmeriFlux, ARM and other atmospheric science networks. The instrument will allow researchers, regulators, and environmental consultants to accurately and effectively measure emissions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales in a quick, efficient, and easy manner."
LATTICE FIELD THEORY BEYOND THE STANDARD MODEL,Office of High Energy Physics,DE-SC0013496,"Giedt, Joel",Joel.Giedt@rensselaerpolytechnicinstitute,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Lattice Field Theory Beyond the Standard Model Principal Investigator: Joel Giedt Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 110 8th Street, Troy NY 12180 Using a combination of large-scale four-dimensional numerical simulations with highly optimized code, OpenMP accelerated smaller-scale codes for less demanding models, and a number of analytic theoretical developments in lattice field theory, we will produce results of broad interest on the dynamics and dualities of field theories. Our first principles approach, the lattice, allows for systematic improvement of all approximations that are made, so that we can obtain reliable, quantitative information about these fascinating systems. Supersymmetry is one of the leading candidates for physics beyond the standard model, and is highly motivated by the number of ""problems"" in high energy physics that it is able to solve. In addition, it is essential to quantum gravity as formulated in string/M theory, and in fact through holographic dualities that we are studying can provide insight into nonperturbative features of string/M theory. Thus, it is crucial to develop an ab initio method that can address questions left unanswered by other approaches. Finally, there is the potential for significant synergy between the lattice method and complimentary tools in the study of supersymmetric field theories. In addition, the dualities that we study in this project illustrate relations between solitons and elementary excitations. This demonstrates that what is ""elementary"" depends on one's point of view. Four-dimensional N=4 super-Yang-Mills Taking advantage of our recent work on suppression of U(1) modes in the U(2) version of our lattice theory, we will determine whether or not there is a sign problem in the case of U(3). We will implement Symanzik improvement to draw closer to the desired continuum, fully supersymmetric limit. Finally, we will implement GPU acceleration of our parallel code. Georgi-Glashow model Taking advantage of code we have developed previously, we will add the necessary boundary conditions to study 't Hooft--Polyakov magnetic monopoles and W bosons in the Georgi-Glashow model. We will verify the expected dependence on couplings, and use this inexpensive model to refine our techniques for finding the masses of these objects. Sine-Gordon model and massive Thirring model We will develop simulation code for the Thirring model and extend our existing sine-Gordon model code to include fixed boundary conditions. The latter will allow us to extract the mass of the kink soliton and compare it to the mass of the elementary fermion of the Thirring model. These are supposed to be dual to each other. Training of physicists in high performance computing High performance computing now plays a key role in many fields of physics and beyond. Our work on lattice gauge theory with dynamical fermions requires the use of some of the most powerful computers that are currently available. Students who are contributors to this research become trained in the development of software tools designed to address difficult problems using high performance computing platforms. These skills are easily transferable to topics other than lattice gauge theory, such as material science, big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence."
"Unraveling Emergent Quantum States in Magnetic Topological Insulators using High Pressure Neutron Scattering
",Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023648,"Xie, Weiwei",Weiwei.Xie@michiganstateuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Magnetic quantum materials not only challenge our understanding of the basic science of materials, but they also can display a range of characteristics of interest for potential future applications in quantum information and other emerging technologies. The unique qualities of neutrons, which “see” crystal structures, magnetic fluctuations, and order, and lattice vibrations, are particularly well suited for their study. Changing the distances between atoms is well known to change the degree of atomic orbital overlap and thus the electronic and magnetic energy levels, and applying pressure is the best way to study how lattice size changes the properties of quantum materials since the degree of orbital overlap can be adjusted “cleanly” without the introduction of chemical disorder. To effectively take advantage of the combined qualities of neutron diffraction and high pressures, careful theoretical understanding must also be employed. This proposed research program applies neutron scattering, applied pressure, and theoretical analysis to determine the properties of quantum materials. The search for a comprehensive understanding of the complex electronic interactions in quantum materials under pressure, including the interplay of collective modes with quasi-particle dynamics and the discovery and characterization of new electronic materials is critical to the development of the field. This requires the establishment of new methods to expose quantum entanglement as well as the means to understand and control the effects of quenched disorder. Neutron scattering under applied pressure will play a critical role in establishing the understanding of these materials. The proposed studies of quantum materials under pressure, materials that display the coexistence of magnetism plus other physical phenomena such as a non-trivial electronic band topology, will have important implications for revealing previously unknown information about structure and magnetism and will expand the number of properties and potential uses that such materials can have. The frontiers are to understand, design, and harness the wealth of novel emergent states that arise in quantum magnets under pressure. The goal of this project is to close a long-standing knowledge gap in quantum materials research by developing a high-pressure neutron scattering (HP-NS) toolbox to systematically determine the magnetic structures and electronic interactions present at high pressure. To attain this goal, we have designed and tested multiple high-pressure experimental approaches through the study of trigonal 122-type AMn2M2 (alkaline earth manganese pnictide) phases using neutron scattering. Building upon our preliminary studies, we propose to focus on: 1) quantifying the effect of pressure on magnetism and crystal structure; 2) validating the role of magnetism in stabilizing its coexistence with topological electronic states; 3) modeling magnetic interactions and spin dynamics by computational theory and 4) centrally, using high pressure to manipulate the interplay of multiple quantum phenomena both experimentally and theoretically. The proposed high-pressure neutron scattering studies will open new avenues for unraveling the effects of pressure on the interacting electrons that dominate the magnetic properties in various quantum materials. This project will form the foundation for the continuing investigation of a variety of spin-dominated quantum materials under extreme conditions, (especially high pressure). The establishment of structure-magnetism-electronic property relationships in forefront quantum materials is critical for understanding and predicting the properties of matter and energy at the atomic and molecular level, thus inspiring new strategies for materials discovery and characterization, and, over the long term, benefits the development of future energy technologies. This aligns with the priorities of the Neutron Scattering Program, also dovetails with BES’ mission."

We will leverage and adapt Plato1 – an open-source2 software developed at Sandia National Laboratories to support multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization in high performance computing environments – to accelerate software development proposed here. Plato is enabled by Advanced Scientific Computing Research libraries (e.g., Trilinos, Kokkos, OpenMPI, Spack, Dakota, and many more) to facilitate automated workflows in high-performance computing environments. While Plato provides performance portable multiphysics simulation, design under uncertainty, and design for additive manufacturing capabilities, its use often requires a specialist. The absence of a sound support infrastructure also discourages potential commercial adopters from embracing Plato. To address this challenge, we propose an advanced platform Phaedo in this proposal. Phaedo would include a friendly web-based graphical user interface to facilitate problem setup, job submission, and visualization activities, including cloud deployment. We will also develop and document the forward and adjoint solvers needed to analyze the physics describing the behavior of solar cells and compute the total derivatives driving the optimization problem. Phaedo will then be employed to address cell efficiency, silver usage reduction, and metal contact reliability in solar cells – some of the most pressing engineering challenges in the solar community today. In particular, we will optimize the metal contact (also known as gridlines and fingers) design on solar cells to simultaneously maximize the current collection and therefore cell efficiency, minimize the usage of metal for manufacturing cost reduction, and minimize the stress in the metal contacts in response to external thermomechanical stress. Combined together, our approach would mitigate the stress-induced module degradation, such as cell cracks that typically propagate through the metal contacts, creating ‘dead areas’ in the solar cell. At the end of Phase I, we will demonstrate that the optimized metal contact design can, in fact, improve cell efficiency with a comparable or reduced usage of metal, and provide tolerance to stress that mimics inclement weather conditions. With a successful transition to Phase II, we will demonstrate the impact of our optimized metal contact design at the full-sized module level for its improved efficiency and reliability. We envision that Phaedo can be easily and broadly deployed in the PV community to increase performance, improve reliability, and prolong stability of photovoltaic modules used in the solar energy market. The global solar market was valued at $146B in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 7.8% from 2022 to 2030. The push towards decarbonizing the electricity sector by 2035 and the scarcity of user-friendly, model-based design tools to optimize PV systems present a growth opportunity."

In the past decades, there have been extensive studies on the interaction of glow discharges, dielectric barrier discharges, and arc discharges with confining or intervening surfaces. The advancement of the understanding of these phenomena is not only of fundamental scientific interest and relevance to the knowledge of the plasma state, but also with profound implications in various technological applications. The research will integrate theoretical, computational, and experimental work within an innovative framework of data assimilation, i.e., optimally combining model predictions with measurements. The scientific merit of this research has three aspects. Firstly, it extends the studies of plasma-surface interactions to systems with insulator surfaces and multi-layer systems, while existing studies are predominantly on electrode surfaces. Secondly, it expects to develop a novel data-driven modeling approach based on data assimilation to enhance the predictive and control capabilities, which could make transformative contributions to basic plasma research. Thirdly, it will shed new light on outstanding problems related to formation of patterns interfacing plasmas. This project also aims to launch an education and outreach initiative at Texas A&M University-Kingsville, a non-R1, minority-serving institution in South Texas. The initiative is structured as a four-tier pyramid. Tier one will be a webinar series for culture and capacity building to inform broader audience in the region about the research fields of plasma science and engineering. Tier two will be the creation and offering of an upper-level undergraduate course on introductory plasma physics, which will help with the recruitment for the upper tiers. On tier three, we will engage and mentor senior design students to conduct work toward the research goal of this project. There will also be a certificate program on general plasma science for undergrad and graduate students, part of which will be lab training at Princeton University. Tier four will be the supervision and mentoring of Ph.D. students. Therefore, this project will systematically expand the talent pipeline, broaden participation from communities historically and geographically underrepresented in DOE SC research portfolio, significantly improve the research and education capacity at the PI’s institution, and contribute to developing a diverse workforce in plasma science and engineering."
Developing a consolidated biological process to upcycle plastics,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022003,"Yuan, Joshua",Joshua.Yuan@washingtonuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Our goal is to solve the plastic waste crisis by re-designing the global plastic economy, where plastic wastes are upcycled to produce high-value compounds rather than being discarded or simply recycled. To this end, we aim to provide an innovative strategy to valorize waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Specifically, we will develop foundational knowledge for effectively depolymerizing PET by discovering and engineering novel PET degrading enzymes (PETases). We will also develop a transformative consolidated process that does not require costly PETase purification by engineering a bacterial strain to both secrete PETase and utilize the depolymerized monomers. Finally, we will integrate the engineered strain’s PET utilization ability with its high-value compound production ability. This project is motivated by our exciting discovery that a salt-tolerant Rhodococcus strain (called RPET) can grow well on the alkaline hydrolysis products of PET as the sole carbon source without any purification step. Some microbes have been discovered to utilize either terephthalic acid (TPA) or ethylene glycol (EG), but microbes utilizing both PET monomers have rarely been reported. Although our novel strain enables a two-step process consisting of PET alkaline or enzymatic hydrolysis and biological conversion of the hydrolysis products by RPET, a consolidated biological process will minimize the use of NaOH and purified PETase. However, engineering efficient mesophilic PETases is lagging despite some recent advances in PETase engineering that generated highly active thermophilic PETases. To our knowledge, there is no thermophilic TPA/EG-utilizing microbe for which efficient genetic engineering tools are available to develop a commercially viable PET upcycling process. To address these issues, we will discover and create both mesophilic and thermophilic PETases by leveraging our demonstrated approaches, including synthetic metagenomics and protein modeling-assisted directed evolution, and develop a protein secretion system in mesophilic RPET. To better understand and engineer this novel chassis, we have yet to understand the complexity of TPA degradation pathways. Our preliminary analysis revealed redundant TPA pathways in RPET, explaining RPET’s robust growth at extremely high TPA concentrations. To complete our understanding of the RPET’s complex metabolic and regulatory networks, we will provide a pathway map starting from TPA along with relevant regulators. Based on this detailed understanding, the project will culminate with demonstrating the consolidated process that converts PET into value-added products. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we will produce muconate and polyhydroxyalkanoate from PET as the sole carbon source. We choose these two products to demonstrate the generalizability of our PET-based process by diversifying the product range instead of providing a commercially viable PET valorization process. Such a commercially relevant process will help drive the US economy and reverse our negative impact on the environment."

Scintillator crystals are extensively used for both types of calorimeters, but the existing scintillator crystals are facing critical challenges. As the luminosities at colliding-beams have increased, radiation damage of the detector components has become increasingly a point of concern. For example, the baseline technology for the most radiation intense EIC EMCal regions uses the well-established and well- understood (but costly) lead tungstate (PbWO4) crystal calorimetry. Despite many years of development and some recent progress in PbWO4 crystal radiation hardness improvement, production costs and calorimetry stability and survivability remain critical concerns. Under this SBIR program, we will develop and commercialize an extremely radiation-hard non-hygroscopic high-density robust scintillator with high light yield and short decay time. The major accomplishments of Phase I were: (a) successful crystal growth of the scintillator using a scalable approach, (b) demonstration of high light yield, good energy resolution and fast decay time properties of the scintillator, and (c) demonstration of the scintillator’s radiation hardness. The major tasks of phase II are: (a) improving the scintillation performance of the detector using various strategies, (b) testing and further enhancing the radiation hardness of the detectors, (c) scale-up of the crystal growth process to match the NP experiment requirements, (d) fabrication and testing of complete scintillator modules. The radiation-hard scintillators to be developed under this program will be used for calorimeter detectors in nuclear physics experiments. In addition to nuclear physics experiments, these scintillators have immense potential for commercial radiation detection applications in military and homeland security."

This project focuses on three related directions critical to developing a fundamental understanding of how to design and prepare integrated photochemical systems for solar energy conversion: First, we are investigating new approaches to substantially enhance solar light harvesting efficiency using a process called singlet fission in polycrystalline and single crystal molecular solids. This process uses the blue-green light of the solar spectrum to generate electrical charges that conventional solar cells degrade to heat. This work builds on insights we have developed regarding the structural and electronic requirements for achieving high light-harvesting efficiencies. Second, we are investigating the fundamental structural, electronic, and energetic requirements for efficient photo-driven charge generation using symmetry-breaking charge separation followed by charge transport in molecular crystals and self-assembled nanostructures in the solid state. Third, we are investigating the fundamental structural, electronic, and energetic requirements for integrating photosensitizers based on radical ions that act as super-redox agents with catalysts to provide the high chemical potentials needed to drive energy demanding chemical transformations. Cutting-edge time-resolved spectroscopic techniques at Northwestern University are used to determine the mechanisms of energy and charge transfer in these systems, while state-of-the-art X-ray techniques at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory are employed to characterize the molecular structures and assemblies. The expected outcome of this project is a new understanding of how to design integrated molecular systems for efficient photochemical solar energy conversion."
Probing novel pathways of iron sulfide acquisition and trafficking from minerals in model biocatalytic systems,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020246,"Boyd, Eric",Eric.Boyd@montanastateuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Metal sulfides form key components of metalloenzyme active sites that function in the conversion of light or electrical energy to potential energy in the form of chemical bonds. The need to understand the underlying physical and chemical principles that govern how microbes capture, convert, and store energy via metalloenzymes (electrocatalysts) has led to broad scientific interest in their biosynthesis. Methanogens have served as model systems for understanding electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CH4, N2 to NH3, and H2 to H+, with key electron transfers taking place at metal sulfide metalloclusters containing Fe, Ni, Mo, and/or Co. As such, methanogens require copious amounts of these metals, as well as sulfide, for biosynthesis of active site metalloclusters and other cofactors. Paradoxically, Fe, Ni, Mo, and Co react with sulfide to form insoluble sulfide minerals such as pyrite (FeS2) that are thought to unavailable to anaerobic methanogens. If follows that FeS2 is the most abundant sulfide mineral in Earth’s crust and is a major reservoir of trace metals (e.g., Ni, Mo, and Co) of critical importance to national defense, energy production and storage, and nearly every sector of the economy. The identification of enzymes and pathways that allow methanogens to bio-mine Fe, Ni, Mo, Co and S from pyrite mineral sources would be a significant advancement allowing for the cost-effective recovery and/or conversion of this raw substrate into metal-based catalysts for electrochemical bioenergy generation. Data from the Phase 1 EPSCoR project indicate that several model methanogens can convert Earth abundant and low-cost FeS2 into molecular biocatalysts that interconvert CO2 to CH4, N2 to NH3, and H2 to H+. Results demonstrate that FeS2 is reductively dissolved to yield mineral surface associated pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS), that equilibrates to form aqueous Fe(II) and HS- and/or iron monosulfide (FeSaq) clusters that are assimilated. Differential transcriptomic and proteomic experiments identified a suite of proteins putatively involved in FeS2 reduction and Fe/S acquisition, trafficking, and storage. Our Phase 2 ESPCoR renewal will build on these paradigm challenging insights to forge a new understanding of the mechanisms used by methanogens to reductively dissolve FeS2 and assimilate FeSaq to meet biosynthetic demands. To maximize impact and to improve mechanistic understanding at the interface of the physical bio- and geo-sciences, the effort will combine physiological, molecular, biochemical, computational, and spectroscopic approaches with a suite of cutting edge physical science techniques to characterize the mechanism(s) of enzymatic FeS2 reduction as well as proteins involved in Fe/S acquisition, trafficking, and storage. Data from the Phase 1 award also suggest that methanogens can bio-mine Ni and Mo from FeS2 to meet biosynthetic demands for these elements. This motivates additional experiments to characterize the mechanisms used by methanogens to acquire Ni, Mo, and other trace metals (i.e., Co) from mineral sulfides. Further, using state of the art imaging, spectroscopic, and computational approaches, we will probe the reaction mechanisms, rates, and chemical transformations at the surface of FeS2 during reduction, focusing on molecular interactions at the mineral-water-cell interface. The research team includes expertise in physiology, transcriptomics, genomics, and genetics (Boyd, Spietz), proteomics and protein structural dynamics (Bothner), Fe and S bioinorganic chemistry (Broderick, Shepard), mechanistic enzymology (DuBois), computational and synchrotron-based surface science (Szilagyi), and mineralogy and thermodynamics (Mogk). They plan to integrate this expertise and uniquely focus it to create a blueprint for understanding and improving the synthesis of metalloclusters in model electrocatalytic enzyme systems. Further, this work seeks to establish new approaches to bio-mine trace metals from pyritic ore, with future application to rare Earth elements of national strategic importance. Energy research and mitigating pollutants from mining operations are major focal points of Montana’s EPSCoR initiative. As such, this work aligns with the goals of Montana’s EPSCoR jurisdiction and will i) contribute to building Montana research capacity and competitiveness, ii) foster new research initiatives that will develop human and technical capabilities at our institution, and iii) create new collaborations and opportunities for funding among team members."

However, we are still in the early phase of the technology development, and today’s quantum hardware systems suffer from drift and imperfections and require frequent calibrations to operate properly. These calibration routines are generally non-trivial to implement and can be time-consuming to execute, creating bottlenecks for the industry when scaling up to larger systems with more quantum bits. In this work, we will develop an open-source framework capable of defining, scheduling, and executing automatic quantum bit tune-up and benchmarking protocols for intermediate-size quantum processors (tens to hundreds of quantum bits). The system will be general enough to support the most commonly used quantum computer technologies, while providing customizability to address the various needs of the different platforms. In phase I of the project, we will build the foundations of this software. We will set up a database system capable of handling large sets of structured experimental data, and combine it with an execution engine that can perform parallel data acquisition and analysis across multiple computers. These services will allow efficient implementation of the control, characterization and benchmarking protocols required for automatic tune-up procedures. Our system will be tested on multiple types of quantum hardware, both in the labs of Atlantic Quantum and at the Engineering Quantum Systems group at MIT. Our open-source approach will greatly benefit academic research and the quantum computing research community more broadly by providing software toolsets that help facilitate the realization of near-term quantum computers. Quantum computers has the potential to revolutionize computing, solving important problems that are beyond the reach of today's supercomputers. However, the quantum hardware available today is imperfect and suffers from drift. We will develop software to periodically perform automated calibration procedures, allowing the quantum hardware to operate with better performance."
Learning to Learn: Designing Novel Neuromorphic Algorithms with Machine Learning,Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research,DE-SC0022566,"Schuman, Catherine",Catherine.Schuman@theuniversityoftennessee,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Scientific research and instruments generate data at a staggering rate, significantly faster than it can be analyzed with today’s computing power. This creates a need for computing that can intelligently analyze data in real time and that can operate with high energy efficiency. An emerging technology called neuromorphic computing shows promise in satisfying these needs through the development of a new type of computer that (i) learns from data rather than being explicitly programmed by a human and (ii) uses significantly less energy than other types of computers. This breakthrough computing paradigm is critical for the US Department of Energy (DOE) to effectively use in future high performance computing (HPC) systems (e.g., as accelerators for machine learning tasks), and as in situ data processing units for real-time analysis and control of specialized scientific instruments (e.g., neutron detectors). To enable energy-efficient, adaptive, intelligent data analysis and control for real-world tasks, a major research challenge in neuromorphic computing is defining the learning approaches that will fully realize the theoretical computational capabilities of neuromorphic computers, specifically unsupervised or semi-supervised real-time continuous learning capabilities. To address this challenge, I propose to leverage machine learning with HPC to discover new learning approaches for neuromorphic computing. Two key barriers prevent the neuromorphic community from developing new training and learning algorithms. First, the speed at which new algorithms can be developed and evaluated is limited because neuromorphic hardware is not easily accessible and current simulators for neuromorphic hardware are computationally expensive. Second, existing training and learning algorithms are not well understood with respect to the diversity of applications and the diversity of potential hardware implementations, nor are they easy to compare quantitatively. In this proposed research, I will use machine learning with HPC to automatically create new learning algorithms that will enable unsupervised or semi-supervised real-time continuous learning for neuromorphic systems. I propose to address this goal through three objectives: (1) develop HPC-based neuromorphic hardware simulators that will accelerate the study and understanding of neuromorphic hardware, (2) develop an HPC-based algorithm evaluation framework for existing learning methods for neuromorphic systems in order to investigate the capabilities of these methods, and (3) develop new learning methods for neuromorphic systems by utilizing HPC and machine learning methods. The third objective is enabled by (i) the use of the simulators developed in objective 1 to understand how new algorithms will behave on neuromorphic systems and (ii) the understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of existing training algorithms gained in objective 2. Learning algorithms for neuromorphic computers have yet to be well established, but they are crucial for the success of neuromorphic computers on DOE applications. The ultimate objective of the proposed research program is to leverage HPC with machine learning to guide the development of new neuromorphic learning algorithms and to demonstrate use of these new algorithms for scientific applications using neuromorphic computers. The goal of this work is to provide a path forward for using neuromorphic computers for real-time adaptive machine learning-based analysis of scientific data."

In broad terms, high energy physics is part of humanity's endeavor to understand the elementary constituents of matter and their interactions, as summarized by the so-called Standard Model of particle physics. This understanding plays out in multiple ways in nature, for instance in atomic structure, the dynamics of the early Universe, and the behavior of stars. Time and time again, studying nature at its most fundamental has been successful in producing deep insights into how the universe works. Our current research focuses on the quark and electron constituents of atoms, the strong and electroweak forces, the dark matter that accounts for most of the mass of the Universe, and the cosmic evolution of the early Universe. This research is motivated by and supports the Department of Energy's investment in high energy experiment, especially the Large Hadron Collider, as well as its investment in several cosmic frontier experiments. Our proposal's objectives aim at answering some of the most puzzling questions in high energy physics, overlapping with all of the priorities determined by the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel. Specifically, we address the P5 science drivers in the following ways: Use the Higgs boson as a new tool for discovery -- After the Higgs boson's discovery, there are many avenues by which it can be used to explore fundamental physics. Our work will do this by using model-independent parameterizations of non-standard Higgs couplings, elucidating the structure of effective theories that impact the properties of the Higgs boson, and working out predictions for new types of particles that couple to the Higgs boson. Pursue the physics associated with neutrino mass -- Our work will examine implications of neutrinos acquiring a Dirac mass, which implies that new fields exist in the Standard Model and therefore new interactions can be present in model-independent parameterizations of new physics. Identify the new physics of dark matter -- Our work will investigate the theoretical frameworks for explaining dark matter and propose new search strategies for its discovery. Uncovering dark matter's properties will help solve the mystery of what it is and how it came to dominate the mass of the Universe. Understand cosmic acceleration: dark energy and inflation -- Our work will provide a systematic framework based on effective field theory to understand the dynamics of the modes that exist beyond the inflationary horizon. Explore the unknown: new particles, interactions, and physical principles -- Our work will investigate extensions to the Standard Model and develop new analysis techniques for particle collider searches, including machine learning approaches. It will investigate a broader class of light vector forces and their implications for dark sectors. It will also study the foundation of calculation methods involving the strong force, which play an important role in extracting new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider. This research will help expand the discovery potential of new physics at particle physics and cosmic frontier experiments."

Novel Signatures Beyond the Standard Model: From Extreme Environments to Precision Measurements,Office of High Energy Physics,DE-SC0022348,"Baryakhtar, Maria",Maria.Baryakhtar@universityofwashington,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Novel signatures beyond the standard model: from extreme environments to precision measurements PI: Maria Baryakhtar University of Washington The success of the current particle physics description of nature opens further questions. What is the nature of the underlying symmetries governing particle interactions? What is the particle nature of the observed dark matter? One avenue toward answering these questions is a class of particles much lighter than any we have observed so far; however, they interact only very feebly with ordinary matter and are challenging to produce and detect. This work will shed light on these particles and further our understanding of outstanding theoretical and experimental puzzles using two distinct approaches: the particles’ effect on compact astrophysical objects, and new detection strategies in precision experiments. Extreme compact objects—such as black holes, neutron stars, and stellar cores—can have significant production rates of these feebly interacting particles, which can yield striking signatures. Specifically, a process known as superradiance leads to exponential growth of the number of ultralight particles gravitationally bound to rotating black holes, and could turn astrophysical black holes into particle detectors. This research will broaden the scope of applicability of superradiance studies to particles with a wide range of interactions and masses. This work will also aim to robustly interpret astrophysical observations in the context of ultralight particle parameter space. If ultralight particles are produced as dark matter in the early universe, they can be detected directly in laboratory experiments. However, these feebly interacting particles lead to small signals that are inevitably difficult to tease out from backgrounds; their detection requires the theoretical development of unique signatures that can be searched for in low-noise experiments. Some dark matter particles could be detected with thin film metamaterials combined with low-noise single photon detectors. This research will develop the theoretical framework for data analysis and background rejection of these precision searches, as well as lay the groundwork for ambitious laboratory searches for a wider class of ultralight particles. Overall, the outcome of this theoretical particle physics program will be to develop and predict novel signatures of new, ultralight particles, and thereby expand the particle parameter space which can be explored with astrophysical observations and precision experiments."

Assuring availability, security, and performance in such an environment poses a real challenge to IT departments. Traditional IT Ops has given way to DevOps to speed up IT’s service response to rapidly changing demands from their stakeholders. The rate of configuration changes in a DevOps environment is an order of magnitude greater than in a traditional IT Ops environment. Now, IT organizations are trying to leverage machine learning and advanced analytics to further automate and improve responsiveness of infrastructure services. This new trend is referred to as Artificial Intelligence for IT Ops (AIOps). DevOps environment which uses automated provisioning and software- defined orchestration cannot ignore the impact of frequent configuration changes/updates (manifested in system/server logs) on application infrastructure performance. Information provided by non-traditional, textual data sources, e.g., syslogs, API logs, outage reports, etc. that manifest as issues on infrastructures, become critical in infrastructure performance analytics. Today’s performance-management tools primarily use numerical network-traffic-related data and limited textual data such as syslogs in silos. Mining pertinent information from textual log/event data and correlating them with numerical performance data on the same analytics platform will lead to faster troubleshooting of application/service infrastructure performance issues. Considering these realities, in this Phase II SBIR project, Ennetix will develop a novel, log-driven infrastructure analytics and management service, called LIAM, to enhance availability, security, and performance of modern IT infrastructures, and greatly accelerate root-cause analysis of issues. LIAM will mine non- traditional textual data, such as system/server logs, configuration change logs, outage reports, and event re- ports from other IT management platforms; and correlate them with numerical network trace and server/host performance data. LIAM will feature advanced machine-learning techniques based on topic mining, novelty detection, and clustering; and it will be built on a scalable architecture to accommodate other user-defined categorical data sources. LIAM will bring useful additional context to analyzing performance anomalies to reduce application/service interruptions and accelerate root-cause identification and service restoration. During Phase I of this SBIR project, requirements analysis and design of the LIAM platform were conducted, a working prototype was developed, and evaluation studies have been performed to determine LIAM’s effectiveness to support IT operations by faster root-cause analytics and troubleshooting of modern IT infrastructures. These feasibility and performance evaluation studies have been accomplished using live data gathered from a large campus IT infrastructure (namely, UC Davis). Outcomes of the Phase I R&D efforts and evaluation studies have confirmed the viability of LIAM as a commercial-grade solution. In this Phase II project (as a continuation of Phase I), the goal is to significantly expand LIAM with analytical features, AI/ML models, third-party integrations, automation methods, and innovative visualizations. A commercial-grade LIAM solution will be developed using which IT operations team can proactively manage the performance of distributed infrastructures. Early trials will be accomplished to demonstrate the functionalities and performance of LIAM on live networks and pave the way to successful market entry and deployment on premier R&E organizations such as UC Davis. The proposed solution will greatly benefit IT administrators and managers at DOE and other organizations through a new approach for IT management which considers various data sources (both textual and numerical) along with traffic data and significantly reduces operational expenditures. The wider benefits of this effort will extend well beyond the immediate DOE scientific community, and on to other enterprises, network operators, and cloud-service providers, who will be able to leverage the proposed LIAM solution to proactively manage their cloud-based, distributed, and dynamic application-delivery infrastructures."

Across academia, government and industry, multiple template metaprogramming techniques have been widely deployed to assist with the abstraction of the varying hardware elements found on today’s systems. These metaprogramming techniques have been proven effective at building high performance applications and libraries across a wide range of scientific and engineering fields. However, the inherent abstraction layers present in these programming techniques presents a challenge for users attempting to efficiently analyze application performance. The goal of the META project is to construct a malleable performance analysis infrastructure that provides users the ability to analyze the parallel execution and memory performance of a variety of template metaprogramming language constructs that is directly attached to the existing LLVM compiler tool chains widely used in high performance computing. The analysis infrastructure provided by META derives and depicts performance data from parallel applications at compile time across a variety of template metaprogramming constructs via command line and graphical interfaces. Through the Phase I effort, we successfully developed and demonstrated the underlying META infrastructure that provides performance and memory analysis methods agnostic of the overall template metaprogramming technique. This infrastructure utilizes the compiler’s existing abstract syntax tree interfaces to parse and construct a directed acyclic graph representation of the target parallel program’s execution and memory patterns. From this, we have the ability to execute a series of passes that derive and present performance related data at compile time. We demonstrated META by analyzing the performance of a variety of high-performance computing applications written using the Kokkos metaprogramming approach. Phase II of the META project will build and expand upon the infrastructure developed in Phase I. First, through the Phase II effort, we will expand upon the initial set of analysis passes to include more complex transforms and investigative procedures for parallel applications and memory layouts. We will also productize the initial support for Kokkos as well as provide support for the Raja metaprogramming construct. Finally, we will investigate the ability to automatically transform parallel applications using the data provided by the analysis passes in order to automate the construction of high performance, parallel algorithms. Performance portability is a cross-cutting problem as developers need to port code across multiple platforms - be they different HPC centers, heterogeneous embedded devices or cloud-computing providers. Providing a vendor- agnostic performance analysis infrastructure tied to an existing open-source compiler tool chain has the ability to dramatically improve the ability for users to create high performance parallel applications and decreasing the time to efficient application solutions."

Concerns about induced seismicity have arisen in the development of enhanced geothermal energy, in unconventional hydrocarbon development, and in CO2sequestration. Earthquakes also impact hydropower through reservoir-induced seismicity, and pose a threat to nuclear power facilities and nuclear waste storage. Catalogs of earthquake activity down to the lowest detectable levels provide a critically important foundation for understanding the hazard that earthquakes present and for mitigating the risks they pose. The focus of this proposal is to create the capability for providing a more complete picture of what is happening on faults in the Earth, and by doing so, to reduce obstacles posed by earthquakes to future energy development. Current approaches to earthquake monitoring date from an era where analog data, limited/no telecommunications, and the lack of computing power constrained operations. Typically stations are analyzed independently, one at a time, and using algorithms that are “static” – in the sense that they do not improve with the addition of more data. The availability of continuous data coupled with high-performance computing and scalable algorithms enables more advanced approaches. Moreover, recent advances in artificial intelligence allow us to create algorithms that are “dynamic” – in the sense that they learn and improve as they process more data. Under this project we will improve earthquake detection using deep learning. In particular we will develop an end-to-end workflow for seismic network processing that will take as input continuous seismic waveforms from a seismic network, and produce as output comprehensive earthquake catalogs for an area of interest. Based on applications of these techniques at a small scale, we expect that full deployment will dramatically improve earthquake catalogs and in doing so, will illuminate earthquake behavior to an extent that would otherwise not be possible. Our goal is to make this workflow general enough to be used both for tectonic and human-induced earthquakes. With that in mind we will develop our deep learning methods using data from both natural and induced earthquakes around the world, as recorded on seismographs featuring diverse sensor types that are deployed in different recording environments (observatory, surface, and borehole). We will demonstrate the generality and power of our approach by applying the workflow to large seismic data volumes for earthquake activity in diverse seismic settings including induced earthquakes in the Central US, and natural seismicity in both North America and Europe. By the end of the project we will make our methods available through Github."

A first major focus of the project is on understanding the high-frequency dynamics of confined water in the context of dielectric screening and isotopic effects. A second major focus is on resolving key questions associated with the energetics of water and solutes in adsorbed films and the influence of these energetics on mineral wetting properties. Finally, a third focus will be on continuing to develop new capabilities supporting the exploration of mineral-water interfacial geochemistry using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, notably with regard to the collective relaxation of the counterion cloud around individual clay nanoparticles and to the electrical double layer (EDL) structure formed by divalent metals at mica-water interfaces. The proposed research relies primarily on MD simulations carried out at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) in concert with synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XRR) experiments carried out at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) by the PI’s DOE BES-supported collaborators at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The proposed research also involves collaborations with scientists at the Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) on the development of MD simulation methodologies and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) on the thermodynamics of thin water films. A key outcome of the proposed research will be a critical re-examination of existing models and theories used to describe the properties of water in nanopores and thin films, including notably models of disjoining pressure in adsorbed water films. In addition, the proposed research will advance current fundamental understanding of aqueous geochemistry and equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects in nanoporous rocks. Finally, the proposed research will reinforce ongoing advances in the use of nanogeochemical experimental techniques for the characterization of geologic media and processes, including particularly broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) and synchrotron X-ray reflectivity (XRR) experiments."

The unprecedented ability to record femtosecond X-ray snapshots offers a powerful means to understand, and ultimately control molecular machines and their work cycles at the atomic level and on femtosecond timescales. To realize their full potential, revolutionary experimental tools must be accompanied by powerful theoretical frameworks. Manifold-based machine learning approaches combine the superb spatial resolution of structural methods, such as crystallography, with the exquisite time resolution of spectroscopy. The primary objectives of this research project are two-fold. First, to develop and validate a new generation of data-science driven algorithms for extracting information from XFEL data by fusing spectroscopic and diffraction data. Second, to develop, validate & disseminate a suite of easy-to-use machine-learning algorithms for extracting ultrafast structure-dynamical information from noisy, incomplete XFEL data recorded with substantial timing uncertainty. These goals are aligned with the priorities of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, particularly those of Atomic Molecular and Optical Sciences, to support research aimed at understanding the structural and dynamical properties of atomic and molecular systems, modern data science approaches to provide new insights to electronic and molecular dynamics and exploiting next-generation capabilities of X-ray free electron lasers."

Traditionally, materials discovery has been the result of serendipity or painstaking exploration of a large phase space of chemically synthesized compounds. A new era started in 2004 with the breakthrough isolation of the first free standing two-dimensional (2D) material, graphene, and the discovery of a slew of novel physical properties which are otherwise absent in its bulk counterpart. Dozens new 2D materials were realized since and many more predicted theoretically. Strategies to assemble heterostructures by stacking various 2D layers, have made it possible to stabilize van der Waals materials characterized by strong intra-plane bonds and weak inter-plane interactions, that could not have been synthesize by standard chemical means. One of their distinctive characteristics, which is due to all the atoms residing at the surface, is that it is possible to manipulate the electronic properties with non-chemical “knobs” such as electrostatic gating or substrate engineering. Thus far, the most successful technique to engineer electronic properties in van der Waals materials has been to introduce a twist between the crystallographic axes of overlayed 2D crystals. This creates a moiré superstructure that radically alters the electronic properties of the material, leading to exotic properties such as topological insulators, orbital magnetism, and nematic superconductivity. However, contrary to expectations, the correlated phases in these 2D moiré materials are quite fragile and cannot survive beyond single digit temperatures above absolute zero. We will explore alternative strategies to achieve robust correlated states. The approach is based on our recent findings that a spatially periodic compressive strain induced by a buckling transition in a graphene membrane, produces flat electronic bands which are much less susceptible to sample inhomogeneity than the moiré materials. The periodic strain patterns will be induced either by substrate engineering, by controlled buckling transitions, or by designing pillar arrays on which the 2D membranes will be stretched to create periodic strain patterns with prescribed geometries. Van der Waals materials to be explored include graphene, MoS2, NbSe2, WSe2, TaS2 and Bi-221. We will employ electrostatic gating to induce the correlated electronic states by aligning the Fermi energy with the flat bands. The emergent correlated states will be characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), Landau level spectroscopy, electrical and thermal transport."

With all the recent progress, one key system of the microscope, the scanning system, has fallen behind. The proposed development will introduce a fundamentally new type of scanning system that replaces slow electromagnetic scans with faster, more precise, electrostatic scanning. The capabilities of the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have expanded tremendously in recent years, to the point that individual atom’s identity and lattice dynamics can now be probed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). These capabilities are enabled and accelerated by technical developments in aberration correction, electron detectors, monochromators, spectrometers, and open-source software. Throughout this renaissance, the scanning system itself – a key component of every STEM - has remained relatively constant. To overcome the current limitations, a fundamentally new approach is required—replacing slow electromagnetic scan coils with electrostatic scanning. Phase I work will consist of proof-of- principle experiments and calculations leading toward the design of a practical, marketable electrostatic scanning system for STEM for building in Phase II. In Phase I, a prototype electrostatic scan system will be designed, built, and tested. The results will inform design decisions for Phase II in each of three key areas: (1) deflector hardware— prototype electrostatic deflector plates will be mounted on the column to assess the temporal response (MHz-GHz), induced aberrations, and effect of instabilities. (2) fast control electronics—existing electromagnetic scan control electronics will be extensively modified to enable electrostatic scanning for testing low noise deflection voltages over a wide range of magnifications at high speed. (3) software—to match the hardware capabilities and with architecture and API providing advanced users access to arbitrary scans quickly and efficiently. The proposed development will enable new types of experiments for researchers around the world who invest in this technology and generate a marketable unique upgrade product for the only US-based electron microscope manufacturer, leading to more jobs in Washington state."

Recent advances in sensing and machine learning technologies are opening up the possibility for “smart sensor” approaches to automation and optimization of data collection and analysis. Such novel approaches, if commercialized and widely available, could provide invaluable information in support of the DOE BER mission to develop predictive and quantitative models that contribute to the Nation’s goal of maintaining and strengthening our energy and infrastructure security, independence, and prosperity. Building on demonstrated expertise with robust, field-deployable sensors, the goal of this proposal is to develop and demonstrate the technical feasibility of a phosphorus sensor that can reliably provide real-time, continuous, quantitative measurements of orthophosphate and total phosphorus from multiple field sources with a single instrument. The first Technical Objective is to develop a sensor platform for distinct quantification of orthophosphate and total phosphorus. In Task 1, a Conditioner Module (CM) unit will be developed for automated pre-processing of field samples to facilitate the distinction between these two phosphorus species. In Task 2, a real-time lab-on-chip assay for quantitative orthophosphate and total phosphorus sensing will be developed, using the effluent from the CM unit. The second Technical Objective is to develop automation of multi-point, continuous field sensing. In Task 3, a multiple source water sampling system will be developed to enable measurements from several nearby pore water sites. In Task 4, sensor capabilities will be validated with performance testing using sample water from actual field sites in coordination with a DOE environmental research team. Beyond addressing a need for improved data, the proposed sensor platform could have a broader societal impact on the widespread availability of safe drinking water. Access to clean, reliable water supplies is critical to our quality of life and our economy, yet across the country millions of Americans are impacted by groundwater that doesn’t meet drinking water standards. Phosphorus is a particularly prevalent water pollutant that impacts countless freshwater systems around the world, which can undergo eutrophication under high phosphorus inputs, causing environmental and economic damage to the local region. Widespread efforts to address this water crisis will necessitate an investment in advanced sensing technologies. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to commercialize a robust sensor that not only meets the needs of the DOE BER program and the growing needs for technologies to ensure safe drinking water but is also broadly marketable. A key partnership with a commercial partner has been established to develop a rapid market entry strategy. The Phase I effort will also involve exploring the potential of agricultural and broader water quality markets, using the support provided by a commercialization assistance firm. Through these diverse partnerships, a path will be developed to demonstrate the various benefits of this technology and poise the sensor for commercial success."

Randomized sketching and subsampling algorithms are revolutionizing the data processing pipeline by allowing significant compression of redundant information. Sketches work well because scientific data are generally highly redundant in nature, often following a perturbed low-dimensional structure. Hence, low-rank models and sketching that preserves those model structures are ubiquitous in many machine learning and signal processing applications. The majority of state-of-the-art randomized sketching algorithms focus on real-valued data. However, many sensing, storage, and computation modalities in scientific and technological applications are best modeled mathematically as other types of data, including discrete-valued data and ordinal or categorical data, among others. The overarching goal of the proposed project is to study randomized sketching and compression for high-dimensional non-real-valued data with low-dimensional structures. The investigation will progress along the following major thrusts of research: 1. Characterizing fundamental limits for sketching of discrete high-dimensional matrices with low-dimensional structures: In this thrust, we will investigate lossless sketching methods allowing probabilistic guarantees for perfect reconstruction of data and will characterize their fundamental limits. We will also establish novel notions of compressibility to allow trading-off the accuracy of the reconstruction with the rate of compression, and will explore a novel error metric for discrete-valued matrices for improving such trade-offs. 2.Designing algorithms for data reconstruction from sketches: In this thrust, we will design reconstruction methods by leveraging rank-metric codes and their duals in the compression domain. We will also investigate several approaches to randomized sketching for sparse discrete data, and will develop scalable non-combinatorial algorithms for matrix completion for finite field and discrete data. The anticipated impact of the proposed research includes advancements in the fundamental scientific understanding of high-dimensional data compression, as well as practical randomized algorithms for sketching non-real-valued data. Hence, the project has a potential to result in a significant expansion of the applicability of randomized sketching, allowing new as-yet-unconsidered scientific pursuits to take root."

More recently that collaboration has grown such that MURR was one of the first to join DOE IP’s University Network. This new partnering approach allows for economical supply of R&D grade Se-75, Lu-177, and Au-199 by combining the organizations’ unique strengths. The mission of the DOE IP is to support the production of, and the development of production techniques for, radioactive and stable isotopes that are in short supply for research and applications of strategic importance to the nation. During the COVID pandemic, the DOE IP was the only formally-designated “Mission Essential Function” in the Office of Science to address urgent biological research needs with continued isotope production. Building on the proven partnering abilities and taking a fresh look at core unique strengths of each organization leads to the concept of establishing a Radioisotope Science Center (RSC) at the University of Missouri-Columbia. The proposed Center would leverage MURR’s competency and experience in the weekly processing and supply of short-lived isotopes as active pharmaceutical ingredients and help further DOE IP’s mission. The proposed RSC will mitigate single point failures for processing critical radioisotopes in the DOE IP and implement current Good Manufacturing Processes to produce high-priority radioisotopes for medical therapies of strategic importance to the Nation. In addition, the RSC will bring tech-savvy job opportunities to a disadvantaged area in Missouri. In order to provide reliable cost and timeline estimates for the construction of the RSC, MURR is proposing to conduct a scoping study for the RSC that incorporates the feedback of a pre-conceptual plan review. Along with updated cost estimating information, this study will also provide the DOE IP with detailed and confident post-COVID scope, costs, and timelines for the RSC including the facility construction, equipment installation, and facility commissioning and qualification."

Because SNF is being stored for longer periods than initially envisioned, the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy, Office of Spent Fuel and Waste Science and Technology is assessing the technical performance of the SNF storage systems after extended durations. The concept of a sustainable geologic repository for SNF disposal relies heavily on the safety provided by multiple barriers, such as repository host rock, overlying rock formation, and man-made engineered barrier systems (EBS). One of the major components of EBS is bentonite-based buffer materials that isolate the nuclear-waste canisters from the host rock and fill up the void left in the horizontally drilled boreholes. The resaturated bentonite has a swelling characteristic, which is useful for self-sealing the microcracks in the host rock and supporting the heavy weight of the canister. However, factors such as nonuniformity in the saturation and swelling pressure of bentonite, and the high temperature at the canister-bentonite interface may lead to instability in the placement of waste canister inside the borehole. Therefore, evaluating the long-term deformation of bentonite-based material under complex thermo- mechanical loading conditions is necessary. By using RESPEC’s experience in characterizing the time-dependent creep deformation of salt in its in-house, world-class laboratory and with minor modifications to the existing laboratory system, time- dependent deformation in bentonite-based materials can be better characterized. RESPEC proposes to conduct a series of creep experiments on bentonite-based specimens under low shear stress and high temperature conditions that improves understanding of EBS under typical repository conditions. The project also plans to develop and standardize an innovative laboratory testing program that will eventually be applied across scientific and engineering disciplines where an improved fundamental understanding behavior of clay and shale is required. The systematic creep testing of bentonite-based specimens will help in developing a new standardized testing procedure that will be applicable for analyzing the similar characteristics of shale or clay like materials in different geologic conditions outside repository science, including in civil engineering and infrastructure projects, underground and open pit mining, and deep drilling."

Indeed, synchronous behaviors extend from the organism to the tissue to the cell to the molecule. Ironically, research on collective behaviors is not coordinated across the research community. Disparate scientific groups work on related phenomena in many disciplines (evolution, biology, physics, engineering, etc.). While the problems being pursued by different research groups have exciting overlap, interaction among researchers has been sparse. The specific objectives of this project are to create an enduring community committed to the study of collective behavior by creating, for the first time, a conference committed to all aspects of this topic. We expect to create this enduring community: (1) through the establishment of a Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on ‘Collective Behavior’; (2) that encourages biologists, mathematical scientists, and engineers to come together to study collective behavior; (4) that supports participation of a diverse community of scientists engaged in the study of collective behavior; (5) that establishes a permanent attractive venue for a GRC at Salve Regina University in Newport, RI beginning on June 6-11, 2021.The impacts of this project come through the establishment of a diverse and inclusive research community that aims to accelerate the progress of studies of collective behavior through the identification of its unifying principles. The conference will encourage new partnerships among scientists, engineers, and mathematical scientists working on these new and exciting problems of collective behavior. Requisite insights may enhance approaches to biofuel production through an understanding of the collective behavior of plants and fungi exchanging carbon for nitrogen and phosphorous, new approaches to biosystem design, and fundamental insights into microbial communication that underlies how microbes living within plants and animals affect host health."

Rappe (Principal Investigator) Objectives: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that generates hot carriers. BPVE offers a unique way of potentially surpassing the efficiency limits of traditional solar cells, and finding novel materials to fully unlock its potential is a crucial step toward mitigating the energy crisis. BPVE requires broken inversion symmetry, and several microscopic mechanisms have been proposed to explain it, including a quantum wavepacket effect (shift current) and a scattering effect (ballistic current). Numerical comparison with experiment reveals that other processes must also be present, so it is essential to formulate a theory that takes into account all contributions and allows for their first-principles computation. A research program is proposed to obtain a kinetic theory that considers contributions from excitation, thermalization, and recombination processes. The theoretical framework will be used to discover novel materials for BPVE usage building on the efficient first-principles implementation of the kinetic theory. Description: The reformulation of BPVE theory to obtain the full description of all mechanisms is proposed, and necessary methodology development required to enable ab initio calculation of these mechanisms is presented. These theoretical and numerical advancements will be leveraged to computationally discover materials offering favorable BPVE for future optoelectronic applications. The integrated research program includes four thrusts: (A) Deeper understanding of BPVE theory. We propose to develop a complete kinetic model that takes into account all contributions to the steady state. We will also explore the response of BPVE under magnetic field. (B) Methodology development. Developing efficient algorithms to compute various mechanisms will quantify their importance and suggest material descriptors that correlate with BPVE photocurrent. (C) Exploring the possibility of BPVE in opto-spintronic applications. We will investigate whether phonon can enable BPVE to generate spin-polarized current, extending its application beyond optoelectronics to opto-spintronics. (D) Discovering novel materials exhibiting preferred BPVE response. We propose two categories of materials that could exhibit large and controllable BPVE photocurrents. Methods: DFT will be performed to obtain single-particle eigenstates and phonon modes, as well as higher-level calculations such as GW quasiparticle and exciton corrections. To accelerate the calculation of BPVE and visualize the photocurrent in real-space, Wannierization will be taken to recast quantities and formulae from Bloch basis to Wannier basis. First-principles approaches will be supplemented with model Hamiltonian studies, which can advise and guide ab initio material prediction. The in-house module for calculating the shift current will be used for real materials and extended to model systems to quantitatively compare theoretical predictions with experiment. Potential impact: The primary goal of this proposal is to complete the theoretical description of BPVE and computationally discover new materials for bulk photovoltaic applications, which will enrich the family of accessible multi-functional materials and provide new platforms for people to experimentally study various properties. To progress towards this goal, more mechanisms will be reformulated and evaluated from first principles, which are anticipated to give more accurate materials prediction and inspire novel materials design approaches. The theory developed for BPVE can be extended to help gain deeper understanding of other nonlinear optical effect, including the higher-order jerk current, and the proposed investigation on spin-current generation will shed light on the unexplained chirality-induced spin-selectivity effect."

Herbert, The Ohio State University (Principal Investigator) Widespread application of computational quantum chemistry to large systems suffers from steep nonlinear scaling with respect to system size, making calculations on large molecules and condensed-phase systems prohibitively expensive except at the most approximate levels of theory. Examination of the molecular-level physics shows that this bottleneck exists because conventional approaches fail to account for the physical principle that genuine quantum-mechanical interactions are inherently short-ranged in position space. While high-level methods capture the important quantum mechanics, when applied to large systems one is essentially paying quantum-mechanical prices for a lot of long-range classical physics, which should be reproducible via lower-cost methods. The fragment-based methods to be developed as part of this work will naturally take advantage of the ""short-sightedness"" of electron correlation, providing a genuinely multiscale computational approach that can seamlessly transition from high-level quantum mechanics at short range to lower-level (and lower cost) methods at longer length scales. Multilayer methods developed in this project will naturally transition to different levels of accuracy based on automated, a priori energy estimates, so that important physical interactions are described at high levels of quantum theory and weaker interactions are not neglected rather approximated at appropriate levels of theory. The ultimate goal of this work is to design, implement, and test a variety of multilayer methods that will extend high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations to systems with hundreds of atoms. Our goal is to make such calculations routine, and to make the software to perform them available to the community. By design, the fragment-based nature of these methods divides large systems up into small, tractable pieces in a manner such that the computational burden is naturally distributable across the nodes of a computer cluster. Fragmentation thus offers a complementary alternative to other approaches to large-scale quantum chemistry, such as massively-parallel algorithm design and ""local correlation"" techniques, both of which operate on the algorithm side of the quantum chemistry whereas our approach attacks the problem from the physical side. Topical areas that will be targeted in this work include: Exploring protein conformational landscapes with high-level quantum-mechanical calculations. This will provide important computational benchmarks for evaluation of low-cost methods and design of classical force fields. Obtaining converged thermochemistry for enzyme-catalyzed reactions. When mixed quantum/classical (""QM/MM"") methods are applied to enzyme-catalyzed transformations, the cost of the calculations prohibits systematic verification of whether the calculation is converged with respect to the size of the QM region. Our methods will provide a more routine and robust way to perform such tests. Developing improved methods for first-principles simulation of aqueous systems. Most simulations of condensed-phase chemistry are based on density-functional theory, but this present project will lay the groundwork for moving to higher levels of theory based on correlated wave functions."

This intermittent process of alternating injection/production in each well is repeated many times. The hot water/steam that is produced by the well cluster via this process will feed an on-site portable small-scale (0.5-1 MW) geothermal power plant. While one well of the cluster is undergoing injection, its neighbor will be undergoing production, thereby providing continuous feed for the power plant, which will in turn provide continuous renewable power. Multiple well clusters can simultaneously be served with multiple power plants using this process. This geothermal project is unique in that it merely recycles already-existing shale wells that sit dormant, instead of drilling new wells which all other geothermal projects do. This project produces no oil or gas and addresses the creation of Enhanced Geothermal Systems in a selected sedimentary area with large temperature-gradients, which is of particular interest to DOE. The Haynesville shale area (TX & LA) has over 10,000 wells with over 1,000 already shut-in, many of them with temperatures in excess of 390?F. However, rather than containing adequately large amounts of native hot water to act as its own hydrothermal resource, the reservoir’s heat must be “mined” using cold water that is injected from the surface, is consequently heated by the rock at the bottom of the wellbore, then flows back to the surface. Moreover, accessing these geothermal resources requires a complex well- completion strategy designed such that the injected water contacts a large surface area of rockface for efficient heat conduction, while still providing a hydraulically conductive subsurface pathway both for the injected cold water to enter the formation, and for the heated water to flow back to the surface. To enable a quick and economical start of the geothermal power generation project, we take advantage of the following current conditions: 1) these shale reservoirs have thousands of wells already drilled and currently inactive, that can be used for geothermal projects, and can quickly be accessed at low cost; 2) these shale wells have already undergone expensive completion programs connecting them to a large fracture network with intimate connection to the rock volume in the reservoir; and 3) modern technology for geothermal power plants includes small portable units, each of which can be used aggressively for a few years to serve one small cluster of wells, and then moved to the next cluster of wells. The principals of Renascent Energy Management LLC, and Ivan E. Terez (PI) & Kenneth R. Kibodeaux, will conduct the research in the company’s office. Ramsgate Engineering Inc. will be engaged as a consultancy to help evaluate downhole tubing/packer changes, and fluid lift design. The overall market opportunity is quite substantial as a large portion of the current 10,000+ Haynesville shale wells are already depleted and have approached their economic limit after only 4-6 years of production, and many of their bottomhole temperatures are above 390?F. Furthermore, there are other shale basins that exhibit similar high temperatures. Thus, conversions of these numerous older shut-in wells may become quite a viable option for generating electricity. Estimated electricity production will be about 1 GW with the modular development and using 1,000 wells, which is a low-side estimate of the already shut-in wells in the Haynesville field."

The hard X-ray regime of the available flux also promises to significantly enhance the applicability of these sources to yield further advances in bio-energy sciences. Consequently, the past decade has seen significant improvements in the detector technology including the Mixed Mode Pixel Array Detector (MM-PAD), DECTRIS’s PILATUS, and TIMEPIX from MEDIPIX collaboration. All these detector platforms currently rely on the use of a Silicon, or a relatively thin CdTe semiconductor bump bonded to their respective readout platform. Although the use of CdTe extends the energy range of these detectors, further increase in energy performance is highly desirable. General statement of how the Problem or Situation is Being Addressed: To address this issue, RMD proposes to develop an x-ray imaging platform based on TlBr semiconductor converter layer that can be directly deposited on a readout sensor using economical vapor deposition process. We plan to use the Timepix chip as the readout sensor for this purpose. With its extraordinarily high stopping power arising from its high effective atomic number (ZTl=81, ZBr = 35) and high density (7.6 gm/cm3), high resistivity, and excellent charge transport properties, particularly in thin layers, TlBr is extremely attractive for high resolution X-ray imaging even for energies well above 100 KeV. Low melting temperature of TlBr (480 °C) permits its thermal vapor deposition directly onto readout chips, thereby eliminating the need for bump bonding. Recently we have demonstrated efficacy of this approach which makes it worthy of pursuing from the technology development and commercialization perspective. What is to be done in Phase I: The Phase I effort develops the design concept and the film deposition process and characterizes candidate TlBr films to demonstrate stability at operating bias with suitable electrode materials. The results of the Phase-I effort will be the design concept, the film deposition process as a flow chart, samples of films and the electrical and x-ray detector characterization of the films. The electrical characterization of the films includes measurements of the resistivity and the current voltage curves, and the radiological and stability characterization includes the measurement of x-rays in single pixels. TlBr films will be deposited on several Timepix chips and the resulting imaging x-ray detectors will be characterized. The Phase-II effort will further optimize the deposition process, deposit films on Timepix chips, characterize the imaging performance, and develop a readout platform suitable for structural biology applications at synchrotron facilities. Thus, the outcome of the proposed Phase I/Phase II program will be an advanced hard X-ray detector with high sensitivity for energies ranging from 8 keV to 100 keV and above that can operate at high global count rates with wide dynamic range, single photon sensitivity and high spatial and energy resolution. Commercial potential of such a detector is high and RMD will pursue that path. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The proposed X-ray camera design will find use in virtually any situation where high-resolution X-ray imaging is desired or needed. A potential commercial application includes of dental radiography where high spatial resolution and contrast are required. An example is the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of electronic circuitry, where feature sizes in integrated circuit interconnects (e.g., solder balls) can be on the order of only a few microns."

The scintillators will be fabricated using an economic process. The proposed scintillator will be tailored to achieve high performance while providing excellent X-ray absorption over a wide X-ray energy range. This approach has numerous unique advantages and will effectively address specific needs of LCLS II. The Phase I research demonstrated feasibility of our approach through (1) sensor design and simulations, (2) fabrication of sensors and characterization studies, (3) assembling prototype detector and performing evaluations at XFEL beam line, and (4) demonstrating high thermal conductivity and high-resolution using hard X-rays. Worked closely with the DOE program officials through periodic reviews for planning translation of this transformative technology into their application space. The goal of the Phase II is to develop a high thermal conductivity scintillator and conduct testing under realistic field conditions with the help from our SLAC collaborators. The key areas of development will include the scintillator fabrication process optimization and thorough evaluation of scintillators at desired X-ray beam power at XFEL. The SLAC experiments will also elucidate on the sensor performance variance with integral X-ray dose, defect generation and associated processes if any, and overall longevity of each sensor. Thus, successful development of the proposed scintillator will enable new avenues of research using LCLS II that benefit the public. For instance, in the development of new drugs (including COVID-19 related work), materials, and systems, all of which directly impact health care, our quality of life, and the widening of the US technology base.

The photocathode is a key element that determines the performance of the detector. Cathodes with high quantum efficiency, large and uniform photosensitive area, UV-visible sensitivity, cryogenic compatibility, and low radioactivity are of particular interest for neutrino and dark matter detection. Currently there is a scalability issue that is hampering the production of such detectors owing to challenges with the cathode growth. The scalability problem with photodetector manufacturing is attributed to the cathode growth process. This problem is being address with a disruptive new method to grow alkali antimonide photocathodes via thermal evaporation of pre-synthesized compounds instead of the traditional growth methods. The proposed process is rapid, simple and has numerous other advantages over the traditional method for growing cathodes towards a high efficiency and a uniform large area response. The innovation here is the bulk preparation of compounds using impurity-free and radio-pure raw elements and the subsequent thermal vapor deposition of the stoichiometric photocathode thin film across large areas. The Phase I research and development demonstrates the feasibility of growing high performance photocathodes using thermal evaporation technique. During Phase I, the following was accomplished (1) synthesis of stoichiometric bulk photocathode compounds, (2) process development to evaporate the compounds into high-performance, large-area crystalline photocathodes, and (3) integrate the photocathodes with MCP detectors to carry out QE mapping and UV response. Photocathodes with peak quantum efficiency up to 23% were grown in large and small formats. The Phase II research and development will focus on transitioning the novel cathode growth process into a commercial photodetector manufacturing process. In Phase II, focus will be laid on process development for Na2KSb, K2CsSb and Cs3Sb photocathodes on large area photodetectors measuring 8”×8”.The technology will enable cost-effective photocathode deposition over large areas, and will be the enabling technology for the realization of highly efficient, cost-competitive new detectors for key science drivers in particle physics such as the search for dark matter and the studies of the nature of neutrinos. Availability of such detectors with VUV sensitivity and improved timing and position performance will not only have a profound impact on particle physics but will also have a transformational impact on critical fields including medical imaging through advances in positron emission tomography detectors, and nuclear detection for homeland security applications."

Aerosol size distributions are specifically named by DOE as a parameter that cannot be affordably monitored with currently available methods. The size and concentration of sub-micrometer and ultrafine aerosols are especially critical to evaluating the dynamics of aerosol processes, to identifying sources and origins of new particles and their role in cloud formation, as well evaluating human exposures important to health. Needed are means to map these concentrations with good time and spatial resolution. Vehicle-based platforms, such as instrumented Google street-view cars or mobile monitors, provide air quality data over a large urban environment. However, such ground-based mobile platforms require rapid time response, of the order of one second, as the sampled aerosol is constantly changing. For the critical ultrafine aerosol size range, which cannot be directly measured optically but instead is probed by electrical mobility, the current commercial methods do not have the necessary time resolution. Our approach separates airborne particles spatially in accordance with their electrical mobility, and then counts these particles as a function of their position (and hence size) through condensational growth and optical imaging. The complete size spectrum 10-500 nm size is captured with 10Hz resolution, making feasible accurate measurements on moving platforms. AMI technology uses an innovative approach to facilitate high time resolution measurements within a compact instrument size, representing a significant advance over existing commercially available technologies. Our Phase I project will experimentally evaluate three key components of this approach. First, we experimentally verify the capability of accurately capturing particle positions across the full width of the mobility separator. Second, we will determine the capacity for simultaneous measurement of positive and negative particle mobilities, as this approach has recently been shown to eliminate the need for bipolar ion source. Third, we will evaluate a new concept for the wide-size size range electrode, which has the potential to greatly reduce the required size and cost of the separator. These key steps will allow us in Phase II to design for cost-effective fabrication methods. Through establishing the efficacy of this innovative approach, we aim to provide a compact and affordable instrument for rapid, 1Hz, aerosol size distribution measurement over the critical size range of fine and ultrafine aerosols. Commercial applications span a wide range of industrial and laboratory research uses for which rapid measurements of aerosol size distributions are needed, such as near sources or on mobile platforms. As speed is always desired, our instrument could potentially replace many scanning mobility particle sizing systems, which have become standard aerosol equipment in laboratories and industry."

As communities look to tackle issues related to urban flooding and streamflow, automated sensors that are low-cost and easy to install will be crucial to monitoring and restoration efforts. The unique challenges posed by urban stream monitoring require an innovative approach to measuring hydrological parameters of interest including stage, discharge, and inundation events. The Hydrological Enduring Remote Observation Network (HERON) is being developed to meet these urgent requirements. HERON is a compact, low-cost solution that is designed to be easily and quickly installed at any urban location. It relies on remote sensing methodology, using a camera to capture imagery, an embedded processor to calculate stage, discharge, and inundation maps, and a cellular, wifi, or satellite modem to report results in real-time. HERON relies on a unique installation procedure, ensuring that multiple systems can be installed quickly and efficiently along any urban stream to create a network of systems. In Phase I, a proof-of-concept data collection system will be built to develop installation procedures, investigate different camera modalities and performance tiers, and gather relevant data for algorithm development. HERON algorithms will be refined and optimized for each camera and results will be compared to ground truth measurements. Using these results, a trade study and various system design concepts will be created to quantify performance versus cost for various system configurations. A low-cost, compact, easy-to-use system for monitoring streams will have many commercial applications and public benefits. HERON systems will provide most immediate value to researchers and scientists studying urban streams who currently are not able to collect as much data, and in as many locations, as they require. However, since the system will be portable and self-powered, it will also have wide application as a streamgage in rural, hard to access locations as well. The systems will find utility in monitoring areas that are prone to flooding, where stakeholders, such as local municipalities, can benefit more timely and accurate information affecting their localities. Additionally, in areas where inundation mapping is of particular concern (e.g., coastal cities or urban areas with poor drainage), HERON will provide a means to create a sensor network capable of providing flood maps in real-time to decision makers. By lowering the time and cost to set up a monitoring network, HERON provides a new tool for resource and environmental managers and planners to engage in routine, continuous monitoring of sites to ensure compliance with rules and regulations, assess current conditions, and make predictions about future conditions."

The field of quantum photonics is continually developing and devices are being fabricated on scalable integrated photonic platforms, including silicon-on-insulator and silicon nitride. However, the heterogeneous integration of quantum photonic devices with optical fibers presents a challenge: The inherent insertion loss or limited coupling efficiency between chip and fiber limits the exchange of quantum information. While such insertion losses are typically overcome in classical photonics by simply increasing the power of the light source, this is not an option for quantum devices that operate at the level of single photons. The fact that quantum light sources and photon detectors may operate at cryogenic temperatures further complicates the fiber packaging problem. Low-loss coupling and packaging structures optimized for room temperature operation will experience deleterious reductions in coupling coupling efficiency owing to differential thermal contraction and shifts in temperature dependent refractive indices of the package and photonic circuit materials. As a result, there is a need for new fiber-chip photonic packaging solutions that can achieve low insertion loss over a wide temperature range. At memQ, we are developing quantum internet technologies based on rare earth ion (REI) optical transitions that operate in the telecom C-band. These sources of single photons and potential quantum memories are integrated directly with silicon photonic circuits, enabling the scalable fabrication of devices for managing quantum entanglement at the network-level, e.g., quantum repeaters. We have identified high insertion loss as a critical challenge to be overcome for the development of the quantum internet, and we have teamed up with Freedom Photonics, a leading laser manufacturer in California, to tackle this challenge. In Phase I of this SBIR, we will address two engineering challenges for low-loss cryogenic photonic packaging: (1) thermomechanical stability of the fiber-chip package and (2) Optical mode mismatch between photonic waveguides and fibers. We will address these challenges using the novel packaging technique of photonic wirebonding (PWB) in which flexible waveguides can be 3D-printed between chip and fiber. Freedom Photonics operates the first PWB tool in the US. Using PWB and thermally-engineered packaging, we seek to demonstrate insertion losses less than 3 dB at 4 K, at parity with those achieved at room temperature. The focus of Phase II will be to push for smaller insertion losses, to integrate our Er-doped photonic cavity devices with this new packaging, and to network devices together in two separate cryostats. This improved packaging will enable more efficient single photon sources. Based on our discussions with over 100 stakeholders in the community, these single photon sources would be valuable to researchers and engineers working on quantum networking and computing. Further, improved optical packaging will have considerable impact on the photonics industry, which is expected to approach $1 trillion in value by 2028."

The state-of-the-art bolometer-based experiment is CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events). Although CUORE is one of the most sensitive 0?ßß experiments to date, further background reduction is needed to clearly observe this rare process. The next generation 0?ßß detectors will be more sensitive, using detectors with particle identification to better reject background events. CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle Identification) is a ton-scale 0?ßß experiment, including researchers from more than 30 institutions in 7 countries. CUPID will use molybdenum-100 containing scintillating bolometers as both the source and detector of 0?ßß events. The proposed SBIR program will further the partnership between RMD and MIT, working with the CUPID Collaboration. In our previous DOE-funded project, RMD developed the crystal growth and processing methods for lithium molybdate (LMO) scintillating bolometers of size and background-purity required for CUPID. The LMO crystals produced to date at RMD have utilized natural molybdenum, but the eventual crystals needed for CUPID will be enriched in 100Mo. Challenges in using enriched 100Mo for LMO scintillating bolometers include purification and reclamation. Suitable purity is needed for low-radioactivity background and strong scintillation signal. Reclamation of 100Mo from the residuals of crystal growth is required because of the significant expense and scarcity of enriched molybdenum. Thus, the goals of the proposed SBIR program are to develop chemical processes to reclaim molybdenum trioxide (100MoO3) from the LMO residuals and to purify the 100MoO3, making it suitable for subsequent LMO crystal growth. The efficacy of the developed chemical processes will be verified by growth and testing of LMO crystals needed for the CUPID experiment. The LMO crystals grown with purified MoO3 will be evaluated by chemical analysis and by cryogenic testing of the scintillating bolometers. Initial Phase-I work will use natural molybdenum. In the Phase-II project, we will scale-up and apply it to enriched 100MoO3 in sufficient volume to produce LMO crystals needed for CUPID."

The current instruments, however, are associated with three main issues: 1) lack of portability due to complexity of detector arrangements which increases its physical size, 2) performance issues due to physical gaps between the detector coverage, and 3) high cost. We are addressing these specific issues in the proposed program with a goal of developing a compact, large solid angle coverage single crystal neutron diffractometer. The problem will be addressed by developing the desired diffractometer using truly hemispherical, portable thermal neutron detectors recently developed at RMD. These detectors will use an advanced sensor capable of simultaneously providing high signal strength to enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR), very high spatial resolution, high detection efficiency and excellent gamma rejection commensurate with the diffractometer needs and can be economically implemented to provide the desired angular coverage. A suitably designed sample handling system will be included in the final deliverable unit. The goal of the proposed Phase I is to demonstrate feasibility of our approach. During Phase I, we will develop the instrument design and conduct experiments at HFIR to establish performance parameters for the final unit. To accomplish this, the following Phase I specific aims have been established: 1) Explore ways to enhance solid angle coverage, design hardware to hold the detector modules, and outline data acquisition and software processing needs. 2) Develop sample manipulator design in consultation with our subcontractors, consultants, and the end-users and 3) Demonstrate feasibility through experiments to be conducted at ORNL. A compact diffractometer providing angular coverage >2p solid angle with minimal or no dead area between active regions will find numerous uses at conventional beamlines, and even in laboratory setups that make use of portable neutron sources. Such an instrument will be well suited for determining atomic positions and displacement parameters of light elements (such as hydrogen) next to heavy metals in advanced materials or new drugs, and will be an ideal solution for studying magnetic structures, phase transitions, disorder, and local structure phenomena. Research in each of these areas will directly benefit public as it will accelerate the development of new drugs, novel materials, and systems, all of which have a direct impact on health care, quality of life, addressing nation’s future energy needs, and will permit widening of our technology base."

A commercial source allows the nation's research institutes to have ready access to high brightness positrons for a wealth of material science, nuclear, particle, and accelerator physics projects. Improving the efficiency of the converter target will allow these projects to proceed without in-house development and translates into lower operating costs and the ability to operate with higher beam currents. By focusing on the total particle shower after the converter, not just positrons, we will reduce the irradiation of nearby accelerator components, minimizing the activation and degradation of those components. This means that one does not have to wait for the radioactivity to decay to access the accelerator vault for maintenance, an important consideration for high energy facilities operating around the clock. During this project, an effective positron converter centered around a free surface GaInSn liquid metal jet will be designed. Free surface liquid metal jets allow for significantly greater electron beam power densities than possible with solid targets. Higher power densities lead to greater positron production and importantly, allow CW operation. By considering electron energies in the 10 and 80 MeV range, this project will lead to positron (including polarized positrons are an important consideration for Jefferson Lab in the future) sources that will be of benefit to researchers in the nuclear, solid state, and low energy particle physics communities.

Furthermore, the slow nature of data acquisition limits their use to materials that are robust under the electron beam. With the advancement of direct electron detectors, several functional materials that are electron beam sensitive such as perovskites, metal organic frameworks and lithium ion battery materials can now be studied in 3D by electron tomography. However, the current methods use the microscope’s goniometer to tilt the sample, which limits the speed of data acquisition and also has a limit in its tilt range, resulting in artifacts in the reconstruction due to the presence of a “missing wedge”. Proposal of Solution: In our preliminary work, we have developed a prototype that uses a DC motor with a fine gearhead that rotates the sample as opposed to the conventional approach in which the rod is rotated by the goniometer. In this proposal, we propose to extend our aforementioned preliminary efforts in electron tomography by achieving the following: Improved tomography holder with higher concentricity: Using advanced manufacturing techniques, we will build a holder that provides better concentricity and provide sample rotation using a built-in piezo motor. Add in situ capabilities. This will allow use of chips or MEMS devices that are typically used for in situ TEM experiments. To take advantage of the 360 degree rotation we will also prototype a continuous rotation tomography holder with a built-in heater that will heat a sample installed on a tungsten needle. Develop a control system: A feedback control system will be developed connecting the holder, detector and the microscope’s stage using Python that will allow users to perform in situ tomography experiments from a single program. Plan: For the first phase of the project, we would i) develop and prototype two versions of in situ continuous rotation tomography holders: a) holder compatible with currently available MEMS devices and b) holder with a heating attachment and tungsten needle. ii) develop a feedback control system that keeps the sample at eucentric height and in the field of view at all tilt angles with minimum radiation damage. iii) demonstrate a heating experiment using the prototype at NCEM, Berkeley Lab. Commercial Applications: Electron tomography holder with in situ capabilities can be used to understand failure mechanisms in various materials of interest in energy harvesting and storage applications."

The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), a cutting-edge, neutrino science international experiment at Fermilab and the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) will play a key role in answering these questions and is the focal point of this proposal. The group will pursue physics and simulation studies of tau neutrino interactions in the DUNE far detector as well as take a leading role in the design, development, and construction of the Photon Detector System (PDS) for the first two far detector modules. These efforts will further the goals of particle physics research, that is, to understand the particle that comprise the universe we live in, and how these particles interact with each other. The group will focus on the physics of tau neutrinos. Tau neutrinos are the least well understood particle in the standard model of particle physics, with only about ten tau neutrinos being experimentally observed to date. DUNE has the potential to increase this data set by an order of magnitude. While the three-flavor model of neutrino oscillations is supported by current experiments, these observations focus on electron and muon neutrinos, and extrapolate the behavior of tau neutrinos using the expected unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix. However, the presence of additional generations of matter, sterile neutrinos, heavy neutral leptons, or other new particles would invalidate the current paradigm of neutrino oscillations. Therefore, it is important to perform measurements with tau neutrinos to verify and test our current understanding of neutrinos. The long-term goal of the group is the study of tau neutrinos as a strict test of the standard model, the unitarity of the neutrino missing matrix, and the three-flavor neutrino mixing paradigm. This effort will not be completed during this current project, and effort will focus on the preliminary work required to make these measurements and tests. Hence, the group will be using simulation and prototype detector data to develop and optimize tau neutrino reconstruction and selection algorithms using both simple cut-based and machine learning approaches. Along with the DUNE liquid argon time projection chamber, the DUNE photon detectors will be essential for maximizing the DUNE physics program, including the study of tau neutrinos. The photon detectors will be essential for triggering non-beam neutrino events, including supernova neutrinos, possible proton decay signatures, and atmospheric neutrinos. Light collection can also be used to improve event reconstruction and energy resolution, which is also critical in the study of tau neutrino events. NIU has been a leader in the development of the horizontal drift photon detection system and will continue this role in the development, design, optimization, and construction of the vertical drift photon detection system. A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students from both physics and engineering participate in all aspects of this research. The group’s faculty are active participants in the suite of undergraduate research programs sponsored by the university. The group also has strong connections to area high school teachers and students. NIU’s Scintillator-Silicon Photomultiplier technology-based R&D program has expanded techniques available for calorimetry and tracking which are currently being used for high energy physics experiments at the energy and intensity frontier, was used for a second-generation proof-of-principle proton tomography device, and has led to two patents. Members of this proposal continue to participate in outreach to K-12 science teachers and students, public events, and public lectures. Today, NIU remains steadfast in its commitment to access and opportunity for students from historically and currently underserved populations. Collectively, students from underserved populations comprise 74% of NIU’s student body, with 44% students of color (including 52% of undergraduate students), 41% low-income and 52% first-generation. These data include the 46% of undergraduates who transfer to NIU from local community colleges. Currently, a majority of NIU students participate in one or more federal student financial aid programs including Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study Program, and the TRIO/Student Support Services Program."

Since exact results are difficult to come by, in the majority of cases, one has to resort to finding good approximations. These approximations typically rely on variational approaches. These approaches consist in choosing appropriate wavefunctions that depend on a set of parameters. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian over these states then typically defines a non-convex landscape, namely one dotted with hills, valleys and saddles of varying heights. The goal of any variational method is then to identify the optimal energy in this non-convex landscape. The resulting problem is a notoriously hard optimization problem that has been tackled with a variety of computational methods over the years. Here, we propose to employ a novel, physics-inspired approach to computing, memcomputing, introduced and developed by the PI, to tame the non-convex landscape defined by variational problems built upon neural-network representations of wavefunctions. Memcomputing stands for computing with and in memory and is implemented in practice with (non-quantum) dynamical systems with memory. These systems can be either built in hardware or, as we propose here, their equations of motion can be efficiently simulated on our traditional computers. In fact, the PI has already shown the efficiency of this approach by tackling a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems similar to those proposed here to find the spectrum of quantum Hamiltonians. In particular, memcomputing has been successfully applied to train neural networks, which will be used, in this proposal, as representations of wavefunctions. The PI will exploit the advantages of memcomputing to accomplish the following goals: 1) Formulate the variational problem as training of a neural network. 2) Transform the neural network training into a combinatorial optimization problem. 3) Apply simulations of digital memcomputing machines to finding very good approximations to the optimum of these problems. 4) Test the scalability of this approach against available methods. As important test beds, the PI will apply this approach to the transverse-field Ising, Heisenberg, Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonians and electronic structure problems, and compare against results from other methods. If successful, this project will allow us to navigate deep into the energy landscape defined by the Hamiltonians of correlated quantum systems. We then expect that the tools developed during the execution of this project may have far-reaching implications by aiding the exploration of a variety of physical phenomena, and the discovery of new physics."

The Department of Energy recognizes the significance of this environmental problem and is seeking innovative research to develop a solution. Southeastern Biochemicals recognizes this opportunity to capture plastic waste before it reaches the landfills and the environment and profitably upcycle it into biochemicals. Their approach is to use a fermentation technology in which plastic wastes are heated to convert them into an oil. This oil is then consumed by microorganisms that convert it into biochemicals. Previous work at Southeastern Biochemicals has demonstrated the proof-of-concept of the process to convert polypropylene into biochemicals in Y. lipolytica, however the product yields were lower than necessary for economic viability. The objective of this project is to apply the principles of genome engineering and microbiome science to leverage metabolically engineered organisms to significantly improve the yield of biochemicals in our process. In this project, we will focus on the upcycling of polypropylene, which is the third largest volume of plastic produced today but has one of the lowest recycle rates. We will assess and engineer two oleaginous yeasts, Y. lipolytica and R. toruloides, to produce fatty acids and fatty alcohols, which are ingredients in many consumer products including detergents, surfactants, and paint. Success in this Phase 1 project will help move our process from technical viability to a technically and financially viable process at commercial scale. Phase II will expand the Phase I success to the remaining major types of plastics to enable Southeastern Biochemicals to process a single stream of plastic waste by eliminating significant, and expensive, feedstock presorting requirements. With this accomplished, Phase II will focus on scaling up the process from bench scale to near-commercial scale. A commercial-scale demonstration biochemical refinery will then be designed and constructed to demonstrate technical and financial viability. With these confirmations, high-volume biochemical refineries will be constructed near the sources of the highest concentrations of plastic waste. With the above accomplished, our solution to give plastic waste a second life as biochemicals will be a reality."

Rajagopal, Center for Theoretical Physics, Laboratory for Nuclear Science, MIT (co-principal investigator) P. Shanahan, Center for Theoretical Physics, Laboratory for Nuclear Science, MIT (principal investigator) The MIT nuclear theory group proposes a broad research program in contemporary nuclear physics. It includes, among other topics, using effective field theory (EFT) to reveal universal functions that describe the dynamics of hadrons and to determine fundamental parameters of the Standard Model, exploiting techniques from quantum field theory, hydrodynamics, critical phenomena and string theory to understand the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma discovered in relativistic heavy ion collisions, and using lattice QCD (LQCD) and related tools to calculate the properties of hadrons and nuclei from first principles and to understand how their structure arises from QCD. A few examples of our future plans are as follows. We intend to use LQCD techniques to probe deeper into hadron structure, developing a precise, three-dimensional understanding of the quark and gluon structure of the proton and light nuclei. Further, electroweak interactions in light nuclei will be calculated in support of ongoing experimental efforts in neutrino physics. LQCD will also continue to be used to constrain the Standard Model and enable the search for physics beyond it. New tools, based in part on machine learning, will be developed that significantly expand the scope of LQCD calculations. We intend to extend the treatment of the freeze-out of critical fluctuations so as to match their three- and four-point functions before freeze-out to the skewness and kurtosis of proton multiplicity after freeze-out. We intend to implement a computationally efficient approach to computing observable consequences of jet wakes in the Hybrid Model jet Monte Carlo code, investigate how Molière scattering reshapes the wakes that jets leave in the plasma, and assess the magnitude and robustness of signatures in substructure and subjet observables. Using effective field theory methods we intend to setup formalism to improve lattice calculations and measurements of gluon TMDs, develop novel observables to improve SIDIS measurements at the electron-ion collider, improve both the theory and accuracy of predictions for subleading power observables, and utilize Glauber interactions to obtain an understanding of factorization violation and of multi-loop amplitudes in the Regge limit. Our research will continue to address the fundamental goals highlighted in the NSAC Long Range Plan that form the basis of the DOE’s national program."

The recent discovery of a plethora of new hadrons, many of them exotic, i.e. lying outside the quark-model, suggests that there may be a whole new “periodic table” of hadrons governed by rules that still need to be uncovered. Exotic hadrons represent the largest unexplored realm of the otherwise successful Standard Model of particle physics. A particular focus are the exotic states accessible at Jefferson Lab, in the currently running GlueX and CLAS12 experiments. One such class of states are hybrid mesons, in which the gluonic field plays an essential role -- while such states are expected within strongly-coupled QCD, the anticipated spectrum has not yet been observed experimentally. This topical collaboration will bring together scientists in a co-ordinated effort to explore exotic hadron physics. Robust determination of the spectrum of exotic hadron resonances from experimental data is a major aim, and will be achieved through the development of hadron scattering amplitudes which obey known fundamental constraints. First principles calculation using the numerical approach to QCD known as lattice QCD will lead to theoretical predictions for hadron scattering amplitudes and exotic resonances. An understanding of the spectrum as extracted from experiment and from lattice QCD computation will follow from phenomenological modeling, exploring the underlying quark-gluon substructure of the states."

Collecting well logs are often passive and associated with additional costs. In addition, many logging packages cannot sustain high-temperature formations often observed in geothermal conditions. In these conditions, surface and downhole drilling data such as weight-on-bit (WOB), rpm, torque, vibration, and cuttings can be leveraged for real-time prediction of petrophysical properties. In addition, at the rig site, drill cuttings are commonly monitored and examined by mud loggers, mud engineers, pore pressure specialists, and other on-site personnel. These samples provide a direct source of information about the formation and help to answer specific questions that well logs data cannot explain during formation evaluation. Predicting permeability and porosity from these data while drilling will also overcome many challenges, reducing the cost of coring, increasing the time value of its utility while drilling, characterizing subsurface physical and chemical changes, and assisting in real-time decision-making. The primary objective of phase 1 work is to leverage drilling data and cuttings using a novel physics-informed machine learning workflow. The workflow combines physics-based simulation, laboratory experiments, and an advanced data-driven approach for estimating petrophysical properties. This proposal is also leveraged by access to cores and cutting samples collected from geothermal well sites available at academic partner institutions. Available data in GDR (Geothermal Data Repository) can be leveraged for developing a robust workflow. Greenpath systems, with the help of academic partner, will have access to unique resources such as geothermal wells core and drill cuttings and high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) laboratory set-ups to perform the laboratory experiments. In Phase I&II, GreenPath Systems (GPS) plans to develop a platform for real-time prediction of petrophysical properties using drilling and cutting data for geothermal applications. The platform will be robust and verified based on experiments, core, cuttings, and field data. Phase 1 work will also include commercialization and market research, such as outreach for capital investment and fundraising. The technology proposed in this application has vast market potential in the geothermal, oil, and gas industries."

Currently, around a dozen nations have programs to develop and deploy MSRs. Challenges to the deployment of MSRs are due primarily to the corrosive and dynamic molten salt. For safe operation of the reactor it is paramount to accurately monitor and control the molten salt properties. Measuring viscosity and density data improve safety and lead to efficiency optimization for flow through fuel and coolant heat exchangers. The viscosity and density measurements must be high-throughput and require only a small amount of fluid. The measurements also need to be precise, and the instrument must withstand the extreme, corrosive temperature and radiation environment of the molten salt. Viscosity and density measurement using cantilever oscillators to serve these challenging needs are of interest. This project proposes a viscosity and density measurement probe made out of diamond for use in molten salt reactors. The technology is based on measurements of the resonant vibrational modes of a cantilever oscillator submerged in the molten salt. The position of the resonant modes allows for determination of the viscosity and density. The oscillator is made from diamond so that it can withstand the harsh conditions of the molten salt. Also, the diamond allows for the optical detection and readout of the oscillator vibrations using a reflecting laser interferometry. GLCT will synthesize the diamond and process it into the cantilever oscillators. Photolithography and structure masking will be done at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) using the General User Program. Dry etching will be done at GLCT. Amplitude-frequency testing of the prototypes devices will be done at ANL. Success in the proposed effort will allow for the better monitoring of nuclear molten salt reactors, which will increase their safety, efficiency and commercial viability. Nuclear molten salt reactors overcome the primary hazard of traditional nuclear reactors; there is no meltdown risk with molten salt reactors. They are safer than traditional technology because they use molten salt as coolant rather than water, and because they operate at relatively low pressure near atmospheric. The waste from molten salt reactors is significantly less radioactive than traditional nuclear reactor technology. New, 100 megawatt thorium-MSRs are estimated to produce energy for $2,000 per watt compared to $2,300 per watt for coal and $4000 per watt for traditional nuclear."

Most real-world applications involve chemical reaction networks in which many simultaneous chemical reactions of many species occur. Advances in high-performance computer simulations and laboratory automation provide an increasingly detailed picture of these chemical reaction networks, but the underlying representation in terms of a graph of chemical species and reactions quickly becomes intractable to analyze as the complexity of the network grows. Network or graph models are often used to represent macroscopic dynamics over processes whose microscopic dynamics do not occur on practical temporal or spatial scales. Chemical reaction networks follow this pattern and represent first principles traversal of a high dimensions potential energy surface. Methods such as DFT can capture these paths, but cannot scale to useful macroscopic dimensions. Moreover, common graph or network representation of chemical reactions does not faithfully represent common higher-order or n-ary relationships. The approach described in this proposal uses approximations of these first principles to provide a fine enough selection method to find high quality paths from higher-order generalizations of graphs known as hypergraphs and thereby reduce overall DFT evaluation. The methods we use are built on novel geometric and topological tools which find mathematical meaningful global structures in practically applicable to chemical reaction data for Li-ion batteries and solid-state chemistry. The initial effort will focus on the extraction, representation, and analysis of Li-Ion Battery Electrolyte (LIBE) dataset. This dataset contains complete data related to the reaction chemistry present at the Surface Electrode Interphase (SEI). Our core objective is to provide principled exploration of large and applicable complex chemical reaction networks and thereby reduce the number of validation cycles by DFT. This is divided into three tasks: 1. Develop ETL software pipelines to build novel data representations of chemical reaction networks; 2. Develop computational reaction synthesis tools from topological data analysis and spectral theory for these novel data representations; 3. Demonstrate these new tools and showcase flexibility of data representation in the context of SEI chemical reactions. The new representation and methods can be compared to existing work on the same dataset which use a kinetic Monte Carlo inspired search over graphs. The phase I project will focus on chemical reaction networks related to the synthesis of lithium ion battery electrodes (inorganic chemistry) and chemical degradation processes of electrolytes in lithium ion batteries (organic chemistry). This has a direct commercial application to the development of improved lithium ion batteries for transportation and electronics, in alignment with the goals of the 2022 CHIPS and Science act. If successful, our approach can be applied to many other problems involving chemical reaction networks in Phase II, such as the development of new extreme-UV photoresists for the manufacture of next-generation microchips and “one-pot” chemical synthesis reactions that reduce the time, cost, and environmental impact of pharmaceutical synthesis and biopolymers."

While carbon emissions associated with electricity production have reduced significantly over the past decade due to a precipitous decline in solar, wind, and battery costs, several sectors including chemicals and industrial transportation remain hard- to-abate. Specifically, by shifting chemical and fuel production away from fossil-based high-temperature processes towards the use of renewable feedstocks and electricity (i.e., “electrifying” the industry), we can substantially reduce carbon emissions from this sector. However, the electrochemical production of chemicals and fuels from renewable feedstocks is still an emerging industry, and for many processes is not economically viable. To deploy numerous electrochemical processes at the rate at which the climate crisis demands, a new approach is needed for the design, discovery, and optimization of novel electrocatalysts and systems. Here we propose a conceptually new approach for uncovering the operating configuration of active sites on the surface of catalysts based on our proprietary ultrahigh-throughput experimental characterization of catalysts, computational modeling, and multi-modal machine learning. We will invert the existing paradigm – which uses a simulation of a material’s structure to predict its function – and instead start with catalyst’s functional data and reconstruct the surface structure of a catalyst from a pool of possible unit cells. This approach eliminates the need for prohibitively slow and expensive experimental structural analysis, enabling us to rapidly discover novel catalyst materials optimized to device architecture and electrochemical environment. Ultimately, the proposed technology will result in dramatically accelerated development and deployment of novel electrochemical processes that address the climate crisis. In Phase I, we will focus on electrocatalytic activity as the main function input complemented by density functional theory modeling and optical microscopy for nanoparticles within a combinatorial 3-element design space. We will explore systems with well-understood phase diagrams and simple-pathway reactions – such as oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions utilized in fuel cells – to demonstrate the potential of this approach. Electrocatalytic activity data will be collected using Stoicheia’s proprietary high-throughput synthesis and screening technology, which will be complemented by computational modeling and artificial intelligence. In Phase I, we will demonstrate that large-scale, high-quality functional data in combination with computational modeling can be utilized to build a multi-modal artificial intelligence framework for accurately predicting structural characteristics of electrocatalysts. The development of better electrocatalysts is critical for achieving a sustainable future, and at a fundamental level, deep understanding of the ways in which molecules interact with catalyst materials will enable the efficient design of electrochemical systems for accelerated time to market. The proposed work enables novel electrocatalysts to be discovered at a significantly faster pace, higher accuracy, and drastically reduced compute power – without the burden of characterizing each material’s structure – representing a paradigm shift in the way new materials are designed and commercialized. Indeed, this foundational understanding will have significant economic impact. For instance, high-performance, earth-abundant catalysts for oxygen reduction in fuel cells, oxygen evolution in water-splitting electrolyzers, and electroreduction of CO2 will provide significant climate benefits as well as unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of value. The proposed work will empower Stoicheia to effect significant improvements broadly across electrochemistry, each of which will bring the global chemical and energy industries closer to decarbonization. Finally, the deployment of earth-abundant catalyst materials (versus scarce materials with few mining locations in the world) will help ensure the geopolitical security of the United States."
Probing Mechanisms of C4 Carbon Capture,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020678,"Stern, David",David.Stern@boycethompsoninstituteforplantresearch,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Photosynthesis is a multistep process that utilizes light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water to simple sugars and oxygen. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) serves an essential part of this process as the site of carbon fixation and conversion to a three-carbon sugar in plant cell chloroplasts. Although Rubisco is required for plant survival, it’s CO2 fixation rate is slow and it can also perform a competing chemical reaction that is energetically wasteful. As a relatively slow and inefficient enzyme, Rubisco is very abundant in nature, and in fact is the most abundant protein on Earth. In some plants, however, mechanisms have emerged over evolutionary time to concentrate CO2 around Rubisco to increase its efficiency. One such group of plants that includes important crops such as maize, sorghum and sugar cane, carries out C4 photosynthesis, where CO2 is initially fixed by a different enzyme called PEPC in mesophyll cells at the leaf surface, then released and fixed again by Rubisco in a second cell type called bundle sheath cells. While this is a relatively efficient method of carbon capture, it is also energy-intensive and involves complex chemical cycling between the two cell types involved. How this cycling is balanced, and how the different enzymes and transport proteins involved are coordinated in terms of abundance and activity, is still poorly understood. Our overall research goal is to understand what limits the flux and efficiency of this pathway, using the well-studied experimental model of maize, as well as the somewhat more tractable system of green foxtail, Setaria viridis. Our previous results have used genetic modification in maize to alter the abundance of proteins that either comprise or assemble Rubisco. We were able to increase Rubisco content by 30%, but this led only to a 10% increase in photosynthesis, because the Rubisco enzyme was not fully active. Separately, we found a method to increase the size of chloroplasts specifically in the bundle sheath cells through manipulation of a Rubisco assembly protein, but photosynthesis was not increased. We are therefore interested in (1) potential limitations to Rubisco activation; and (2) How the ability to manipulate chloroplast size could yield insights into C4 photosynthesis limitations, and how chloroplast size is related molecularly to Rubisco assembly. Rubisco must be activated by an enzyme called Rubisco Activase, or RCA, whose regulation is particularly poorly understood in C4 plants. We will create Setaria plants though gene editing that lack either or both of the two forms of RCA, to understand their respective roles in regulating Rubisco and thus carbon assimilation. We will then use these modified lines as a platform to study designer versions of RCA that may overcome inherent limitations of native RCA. These experiments will combine measurements of Rubisco biochemistry with investigations of photosynthetic kinetics and metabolites, and lead to new models to explain carbon assimilation regulation in these plants. We will also pursue the still-puzzling finding that the Rubisco assembly protein BSD2 regulates chloroplast size in bundle sheath cells. We are interested in its presumed protein partners that carry out this regulation, and also whether increasing chloroplast size via BSD2 will lead to higher Rubisco activity and ultimately carbon assimilation. Again, a systems approach combining molecular, physiological and biochemical methods will be employed. Together, we will test and develop hypotheses that link carbon assimilation in C4 plants to the assembly and activation of Rubisco, as well as to the activities of other enzymes that participate in the assimilation pathway."

Replacing cast iron and traditional steel components with lightweight polymer composites can directly reduce the weight of a vehicle’s body and chassis by up to 50% and therefore reduce fuel consumption. Lightweighting of vehicle structures clearly represents a significant opportunity for energy savings, however traditional composites manufacturing technologies offer either high volume or significant weight savings, but not both. Sheet molding compound has dominated the automotive composites market since it can achieve high-volume manufacturing however the use of chopped fibers inefficiently capitalizes upon the reinforcement, leading to materials with poor specific properties. With the Vehicle Technologies Office targeting a 25% glider weight reduction at less than $5/lb-saved by 2030, innovative new materials that achieve both rapid cure and significantly improved mechanical properties are required to capitalize on higher cost carbon fiber reinforcement. Recently, high-pressure resin transfer molding (HP-RTM) has emerged as an alternative approach to manufacture composite materials with continuous fiber reinforcement. In the Phase I, Trimer Technologies demonstrated a low-cost resin that exhibits the strength, stiffness, and toughness of aerospace resins but can achieve full cure in under 60 seconds. The resin also has a glass transition temperature more than twice the value of current state of the art infusion polymers used in the automotive industry and is non-flammable without additives. During the proposed Phase II SBIR, Trimer will collaborate with the Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) Scale-up Research Facility (SuRF) to demonstrate HP-RTM manufacturing cycle time under 60 seconds. Trimer will perform extensive characterization of the composite properties to enable process optimization and provide the pathway to high volume manufacturing of lightweight composite automotive parts. The proposed materials will enable both high volume manufacturing and significant weight savings in vehicles structures. The automotive composite market was estimated at $15.84 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow to $29 billion in 2025 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9%. The DOE projects that the use of lightweight components and high efficiency engines in only one quarter of the U.S. fleet could save more than 5 billion gallons of fuel annually by 2030. This translates to reduction of ~100 billion pounds of CO2 emissions annually and would further contribute to reducing N2O emissions therefore providing significant impact on the public. Lightweighting of vehicle structures represents a significant commercial market and opportunity for energy savings, however traditional composites manufacturing technologies cannot achieve both high volume production and significant weight savings. The automotive industry requires new high strength polymers which can effectively capitalize upon the reinforcement potential of carbon fiber without added cost. Ultimately, Trimer’s novel polymer provides a combination of properties not found in state- of-the-art resins while also providing reduced raw material and manufacturing cost therefore creating significant commercialization potential."

Photodetectors of very small pixel size (5-7 micron) will be designed, fabricated and tested based on silicon SiPM and gallium GaInP technologies, with emphasis on high photo detection efficiency, low saturation, fast recovery and radiation resistance. Use of photosensors is ubiquitous in experimental research and in many commercial and medical applications. This program will develop and refine small pixel devices of both technologies, with emphasis on light detection in the green/red and ultraviolet/blue spectral regions. It is expected that the silicon developments will be widely applicable. But if successfully developed, GaInP photosensors hold promise of effective operation in radiation fields an order of magnitude greater than for silicon devices. The photosensors will be used to detect light emission from various types of active media, including scintillation crystals and ceramics. The focus here will be on lutetium-based scintillation crystals and ceramics which have high brightness and excellent radiation hardness. Depending upon the scintillation material or experimental application, the photosensors can be used to detect the scintillation light directly, or indirectly using wavelength shifters. For the second approach, the transfer of light from scintillation materials to the photosensors will be enabled by the use of new fluorescent dyes which are dissolved into liquids and incorporated into the cores of radiation hard quartz capillary waveguide elements. This waveshifting capillary technique can facilitate light collection over larger volumes of material and under high irradiation conditions. Fluorescent dye and waveguide refinement and optimization are central to this development. The impact of this research and development program on optical detector elements, while not experiment specific, is potentially broad and significant, and can be expected to inform further developments in high energy physics instrumentation: accelerator based, underground based and space based. Modular elements of the scintillator, waveshifter and photosensor elements will be tested for performance under high radiation conditions, and for efficiency and fast timing characteristics. The technologies are versatile and can be applied in nuclear physics, materials science, basic energy sciences and extended to medical physics and homeland security domains."

Expedited risk quantification of infrastructure network systems is of utmost importance for resiliency assessment against natural or man-made hazards. Currently available techniques for network probabilistic risk assessment suffer from large-scale computational challenges. A practical means for expedient and accurate quantification of risk associated with infrastructure networks is needed to safeguard critical infrastructure systems against potential high-risk threats. Protection Engineering Consultants, LLC (PEC) proposes to develop novel technology for expedited risk analysis of large electric grid systems. The proposed technology will utilize a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)- based probabilistic modeling technique to exploit the structure of large, sparse matrices representing electric grids. The framework will leverage various ASCR-funded numerical packages thus offering improved efficiency relative to the existing state-of-the-practice commercial platforms. The proposed framework will be encoded into a suite of numerical tools – Network Risk Assessment Toolkit (NetRAT) for commercial deployment. During Phase I, PEC, with support from consultant Dr. Michael Shields, will develop Network-level Risk Assessment Module (NetLevRAM) that will utilize RMT-based technique and leverage various ASCR-funded libraries to exploit the structure of large, sparse matrices representing energy grids. A part of the technical approach will focus on careful manipulation of matrix algebra computations to estimate eigenvalue bounds for network risk assessment. Another focus will be on utilization of various ASCR-funded numerical packages, e.g., STRUMPACK, Trilinos, Dakota, and OpenMPI, to gain computational efficiency, and their integration with opensource package UQpy to develop an extensible commercial module ECMUQpy. The performance of the toolkit will be assessed across several computational platforms using testbed data. The feasibility of our proposed technology will be demonstrated during Phase I, and a Phase II effort will focus on advancing our network risk analysis algorithms, expanding our validation dataset, and building out the front-end graphical user interface (GUI) for the field-deployable platform. Our finished toolkit will be at market-ready status at the end of Phase II; interested users will be broad-ranging, from field engineers to energy grid stakeholders and local emergency response/planning personnel. We also envision a potentially broader user base comprising military and civilian critical infrastructure owners/users (e.g., NNSA sites, commercial NPPs, DOE, DOT, EPA)."

In this approach, an XFEL pulse (5-10 keV) serves as a pump, creating population inversion in a solid medium and resulting in highly coherent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) radiation. This radiation can be further filtered and returned with an X-ray cavity for subsequent seeding, similarly to a conventional active medium laser oscillator. However, the focused high intensity X-ray pulses are destructive to the lasing medium in a single shot; thus, in an oscillator configuration, it is required for an active medium material to be replenished with a new fresh sample before the next shot on the sub-microsecond time scale. In Phase I, our proposed solution will use copper as the gain medium, lasing at Ka1 transition. In order to maximize the number of copper atoms in the interaction region, this device will use copper foil targets, and to ensure replenishment of the copper gain medium, it will be rotated up to a target velocity of 300m/s. The disk will be driven with high-speed electric motors and supported by high-speed low friction bearings in order to achieve the required velocities. The spindle topology, foil support frame and critical dynamic balancing systematics will be studied. At these high speeds imbalances can be caused by deviations in the angular mass distributions on the order of <10 milligrams. Tradeoffs between a low friction low load air bearing solution and precision preloaded mechanical bearings will be studied. Alignment mechanisms and tolerance budgets will be established to ensure that the foil remains within the critical Rayleigh range of the pump laser. Considerations for operating conditions, such as atmosphere, gas or vacuum and a containment chamber with appropriately considered laser windows will be developed. A commercial version of the system may be utilized at multiple X-ray FEL facilities for ASE R&D. In addition, with some modifications, the system can be applied in other areas where non-degradable diagnostics, or beam targets are intercepted by beams of photons or charged particles, when the intensity is destructive to the sample without rapid replenishment. Such scenarios are quite ubiquitous, including well familiar to RadiaBeam high speed interceptive beam diagnostics, as well as rotating anodes and collimators for high intensity industrial accelerators (i.e., such as required for FLASH radiation therapy)."

By developing Powder Metallurgical-Hot Isostatic Pressing operational conditions and can removal approaches to build and validate 316H stainless steel boiler materials for enhanced creep- fatigue performance, large scale near net shape components can be built for next generation molten salt nuclear reactors. Molten salts enable more economical operation due to higher temperatures (>600°C), thermal energy storage, and ability to dissolve fuel in the coolant. New reactor material manufacturing methods require validation and testing of these material systems to prove that they can meet or exceed the safety and lifetime protocols of conventionally produced materials. The Phase I/II objective is to develop a near net shape Powder Metallurgical-Hot Isostatic Pressing method to build and demonstrate near net shape high quality, complex 316H stainless steel components for nuclear reactor systems, including pumps, valves, and pressure vessels. State-of-the-art manufacturing processes can provide more economical fabrication of near net shape homogeneous material that meet or exceed the structural properties of conventional materials.

Specifically, Phase I will study the effect of grain size, molten salt corrosion, and the surface damage that may result during can removal on the high temperature creep fatigue performance. The results of the Phase I will lead to a manufacturing strategy to produce a large scale near-net shape Powder Metallurgical-Hot Isostatic Pressing components of 316H stainless steel boiler materials that will be of interest to the molten salt reactor community. Phase II will include the build of a large structure and extract creep-fatigue specimens to demonstrate structural performance uniformity. This approach could be used to build near net shape boilers, pumps, valves, and pressure vessels for use in high temperature application where boiler materials (per American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards) are required.

Tires on electric cars wear out 20% faster on average because of increased torque and weight, so the impact of tire pollution will grow in significance as electric vehicles continue to grow in popularity. Simulation tools used for other aspects of tire and automotive design cannot accurately predict tread wear because intricate tread patterns are too computationally expensive to model with traditional hexahedral and tetrahedral elements used for finite element analysis. In this Phase I SBIR, the company will apply its patent-pending isogeometric analysis ap- proach to predict tire tread wear. In this approach, the time-intensive meshing and defeaturing approximation steps are eliminated. Instead, the computer-aided design model that will be used for manufacturing is used directly in the simulation, immersed in a smooth spline computation domain. The company will partner with a leading rubber fatigue calculation provider to ensure accurate application of its technology to this domain. The ASCR-funded MFEM library will be used to accelerate the compute of locally adaptive regions of the computation domain. In Phase I, the company will enhance MFEM to be able to compute on adapted isogeometric bases, and will integrate this to its isogeometric analysis solver. Industry-specific functionality will be added to the isogeometric analysis solver. A proof of concept workflow will be completed, demonstrating a tire-tread simulation directly on a fully detailed computer-aided design tire model. The proposed workflow is also applicable to the development and simulation of entire non- pneumatic (airless) tires, which feature similar geometric complexity as tire tread. Non-pneumatic tires that don’t go flat may be critical to the broad utilization of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, this technology will be applicable to other industries, including aerospace, defense, automotive, and nuclear energy, that have shown interest in the time-saving, accurate isogeometric analysis approach to finite element analysis."

We utilize the innovative machine learning (ML) and experimental methods of synthetic biology developed by the founders at Argonne National Laboratory and exclusively licensed to the company. Our proof-of-principle de novo engineering of threonine-producing strains serves as a validation of our technology. In a pilot study, 600 strains carrying pairwise combinations of modifications of 20 genes selected via metabolic pathway analysis and inserted in in two bacterial hosts, were subjected to two rounds of ML-driven engineering cycles in which we analyzed 107- variant virtual space of combinations. The best threonine producers resulting from this pilot were 2.5X times more productive (in laboratory conditions) than the industrial control strain. Although the company is very young, BSMI has an exceptionally strong position in synthetic biology, with the key personnel and advisory team having an extensive list of publications and established track record in ML, computational biology, database construction, metabolic modelling, microbiology, and industrial fermentation. Our SBIR project team has extensive expertise in company-wide management for construction of industrial microorganisms used by large-scale commercial processes. Development of genome-wide annotation techniques revolutionized the world of functional interpretation of genomes and were implemented in the widely accepted SEED and RAST platforms in which BSMI team members played important roles. Our aspiration is to use proprietary AI, computational, and experimental approaches to synthetic biology to change organism engineering for microbiological production of chemicals. Our business goal is to deliver value-added and innovative strain development services and groundbreaking new products that address real biomanufacturing market needs. In this SBIR project we plan to develop a novel and yet unproven hybrid ML approach to combinatorial gene target selection that would integrate knowledge-based ML model design with agnostic iterations of target prediction/validation. This project aims to add hypotheses- based-on-a-prior-knowledge element to ML in the construction of new superior bio producents. Engineering of organisms for biotechnological purposes provides rich data for future analysis which has to be stored, curated and integrated in the strain design process; for this, we are developing a sophisticated and user-friendly tool for a storage, integration, and alignment of multiple data types, and it is to be populated during this SBIR project. (1) a validated hybrid-ML approach for strain engineering applicable to a broad range of biomanufacturing projects; (2) a specific set of proprietary software tools supporting this approach, and (3) an improved threonine-producing strain for commercial use. Our innovative solution to the complexities of organism construction is a combination of hypothesis-driven MM-based data refinement and Accelerated “Agnostic” Strain Engineering (AASE), a modification of a generic Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) approach which relies on ML and combinatorial gene engineering. Such hybrid approach, assisted by a prior knowledge, where it is available, is universal in nature and can dramatically expand the list of chemicals produced in biomanufacturing by eliminating its biggest bottleneck - the slow, expensive, and poorly predictable process of strain development."

Conventional spectroscopic techniques, however, average thousands of non-sequential left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized spectra together before generating a circular dichroism spectrum, leading to long acquisition times and significant baseline drift in time-resolved experiments. These drawbacks limit the accessibility of time-resolved circular dichroism spectroscopy, and hampers efforts to develop new diagnostic platforms for the advancement of next-generation energy and communication technology. In this proposal, PSI proposes the modeling, design, and validation of a transient-grating, time-resolved circular dichroism module for background-free, wavelength-agnostic investigations of material chirality. This approach uses two, cross-polarized laser pulses to induce a transient grating in sample that deflects a third probe pulse if, and only if, the sample has a circular dichroism response at that wavelength. The lack of any electro- optical devices or bandwidth limiting optics in the transient grating approach allows for a versatile spectrometer aimed at making time-resolved circular dichroism an accessible diagnostic technique for next-generation material characterization. The Phase I program will involve the development of an instrument model, the initial optical design of the transient grating spectrometer, a validation experiment, and the design of a prototype module. The commercial application of the transient-grating, time-resolved circular dichroism model stems from the technique’s continued application in measuring the complicated spin-dynamics of advanced material systems. The module will be made versatile enough that continued development beyond Phase II will result in a general platform for four-wave mixing techniques with diagnostic capabilities for these novel materials. A suitably general spectrometer has the ability to provide a significant characterization advance for materials used in next-generation energy and communication technology."

The largest bottleneck for quantum networking is optical loss, which reduces quantum information fidelity and occurs at the component and system- level interconnects. Developing ultra-low loss interconnects is critical for realizing quantum networks in the near term. To solve the challenge of ultra-low-loss optical interconnects, this program will develop a standard fiber to photonic chip connector based on gray-scale 3D printing. As more quantum technologies take advantage of photonic and electronic integrated circuits, we require techniques for efficiently extracting light off chip and into long-distance fibers that connect the network. Our gray-scale lithography approach provides the best control of connector geometries, optical interfaces, and refractive indices of any technology and thus will allow us to achieve the lowest optical losses and develop swappable design that are customized for different quantum platforms. In Phase I, we will leverage our ongoing work developing chip-based quantum technologies and 3D gray-scale printing to create ultra-low loss connectors between entangled-photon sources, quantum encoding and routing devices, and optical fibers. Combined, these elements comprise the foundation for implementing a quantum network. We will design, fabricate, and evaluate prototype connectors to demonstrate our capability. Phase I will target connecting two devices with < 1 dB connection loss, which will pave the way for a Phase II effort that will target tens of devices with < 0.5 dB loss at each interconnect. Our mode-converter technology will enable ultra-low loss optical interconnects between integrated chips and current fiber-based networks, greatly increasing the capacity of near-term quantum networks without the bottleneck of optical loss limiting the network scale. This approach will reduce infrastructure requirements to expedite development of some of the first quantum networks. These devices will become key components for every node within a quantum network, which will enable advanced quantum computing, secure communication, and distributed quantum sensing. Note that low-loss interconnects could also have a major role in classical telecommunications as well, increasing system efficiency and bandwidth."

Lab & Univ. of Calif. at Davis (Co-Investigator) Yen-Jie Lee, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Co-Investigator) Xin Dong, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (Co-Investigator) Anthony Frawley, Florida State University (Co-Investigator) In the first few microseconds of its existence the Universe was filled with an extremely hot medium called “quark-gluon plasma” (QGP). As the QGP cooled down, it eventually converted into bound states called hadrons, such as protons and neutrons, which later formed atomic nuclei, the building blocks of the visible matter in today’s Universe. Modern-day experiments where atomic nuclei are accelerated and collided at high energies, such as the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven Lab in the US and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Europe, provide the fascinating opportunity to recreate the QGP in the laboratory, 14 billion years after it last existed, while future experiments at the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) in the US will study fundamental aspects of cold nuclear matter. The QGP created in the laboratory is very short-lived, and its properties have to be inferred from the thousands of particles that are produced and subsequently measured in large detectors. Hydrodynamic simulations of the expansion dynamics of the QGP fireballs have found that it behaves as a ""nearly perfect liquid”, with a record low value for the ratio of viscosity over entropy density, close to a conjectured lower bound set by quantum mechanics. While the fundamental theory of the strong nuclear forces, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is well established, the emergence of the properties of QCD matter from its fundamental interactions remains a great challenge in modern research. The heavy charm and bottom quarks (referred to as ”heavy flavor”), which are produced upon initial impact of the colliding nuclei, are premier probes of the QGP: their large masses cause a diffusive motion that can serve as a “Brownian” marker of the interactions in the QGP, including the fundamental process of the quark binding into hadrons. However, a reliable analysis of heavy-flavor measurements requires a broad knowledge of the various processes that heavy quarks undergo throughout a nuclear collision until their final observation in experiment. The objective of this collaboration is to combine the capabilities of leading US researchers in the field to develop a rigorous and comprehensive theoretical framework to describe heavy flavors in QCD matter, from the initial production of heavy quarks when the nuclei first collide, via subsequent diffusion through the QGP and to their hadronization into heavy-flavor particles. This framework will be embedded into realistic numerical simulations that enable quantitative comparisons to experimental data. The methods employed include first-principles lattice-QCD computations of novel heavy-quark operators in hot QCD matter, analyzed using heavy-quark effective field theories and quantum many-body theory to derive transport coefficients, quantum transport approaches combined with rigorous statistical data analysis, and advanced perturbative calculations for initial heavy-quark production. The resulting framework will enable accurate assessments of QGP transport properties and unravel the underlying microscopic processes driving them, thereby providing unprecedented insights into the inner workings of the QGP based on QCD. Phenomenological analyses of experimental data will take full advantage of the upcoming precision-measurement campaigns by the sPHENIX collaboration at RHIC and dedicated upgrade programs at the LHC, and develop connections to heavy-flavor probes at the future EIC. The RHIC and LHC programs place great emphasis on bottom-quark observables, as its large mass allows for a greater theoretical precision than in the charm sector. Junior researchers will be hired to achieve these scientific goals, synergizing the expertise of the senior personnel. A diverse working environment of mutual respect and individual responsibility will be created, enabling the junior researchers to grow into future leaders of the field."

However, issues associated with both radioactive and non-radioactive species have resulted in huge hurdles for remediation efforts. Obvious problematic ions are radioactive contaminants such as the actinides. In addition, non-radioactive ionic species, particularly negatively charged ions, anions, are also high on the list of remediation challenges. This project uses a combination of anion recognition tactics incorporated in single &ldquo;multi-tasking&rdquo; molecular anion hosts in order to capture anions that are especially relevant to DOE remediation efforts. Anions are prevalent throughout the environment. They participate in a variety of important natural chemical reactions such as the nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles, which help to maintain balance within the global ecosystem. However, anions can also wreak havoc when overabundance and pollution occur. Addressing these issues, through removal or extraction of problematic anions such as sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, and pertechnetate, is a chemical challenge because anions are noted for their resistance to analytical applications such as sensing and extraction. This elusiveness is a result of the nature of the structure of anions: diffuse electron density over, in most cases multiple atoms, and, especially for oxoanions, high hydration energies. These properties make it difficult for sensors and sequestering agents to compete with the water that usually houses the anions of interest. This project will combine the use of supramolecular host-guest chemistry, which involves non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, with other anion attraction strategies to more effectively bind selected anions. The resulting new &ldquo;multi-tasking&rdquo; hosts will allow for more effective anion recognition and binding. Primary target anions, chosen based on the Department of Energy&rsquo;s separations needs, will be nitrite, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate. Secondary focus will be on accompanying cations, primarily alkali and transition metal ions. The synergistic effects provided by incorporating additional recognition capabilities within host molecules will allow for a better understanding of ancillary, multi-tasking, influences in supramolecular anion recognition. Three secondary strategies for leveraging anion attraction will be explored. First, hosts have been designed that contain pockets for attracting cationic partners for the anions, in addition to sites for anion sequestration. Specifically, an appropriate number of sites for charge balance will be added to accommodate multiply-charged anions, a largely unexplored but fundamental area of supramolecular chemistry. Second, hosts capable of acting as on-off switches for anion binding and release will be explored using the oxidation and reduction capabilities of transition metal ions and conjugated ligand systems. The third strategy is to utilize expanded polymer-like arrays of transition metal-linked anion hosts to explore the leveraging effects of multiple systematic arrays of anion sites that create pores and channels for anions within shielded walls. In conclusion, by virtually limitless design possibilities for expanded &ldquo;tasking sites,&rdquo; multi-tasking hosts can provide new inroads on supramolecular and separations challenges."

In the Migdal effect an atomic nucleus receiving a small kick can emit an atomic electron or other detectable signals. Migdal originally considered the nuclear recoil in a- and ß-decay, where the effect has been observed, but recent theoretical work applied to dark matter interactions has not been validated. Nevertheless, a number of experiments have recently invoked this effect to improve their sensitivity to lower dark matter masses, some by almost 2 orders of magnitude. Given how these and future experiments could impact the dark matter landscape, an experimental verification of the effect under these conditions is very much needed. This proposal is for research and development of a liter-scale negative ion drift (NID) time projection chamber (TPC) detector operating in low-pressure gas with a small admixture of an electronegative component. The latter results in NID operation of the detector, which provides the high resolution, 3D reconstruction of low energy ionization tracks needed to detect and study the Migdal effect. The TPC will employ a fine-grained 2D strip readout instrumented with electronics designed at Brookhaven National Labs for use in liquid argon TPCs. The slow NID speed enables exquisite measurements of the arrival time of ionization at the readout plane, which is used to reconstruct the 3rd dimension of the particle track. Once the detector is constructed we will characterize its performance for the Migdal effect by using ionization tracks produced with electrons, alpha particles and nuclear recoils emitted from radioactive sources. We will conduct these measurements in low-pressure NID gas mixtures containing elements of interest for dark matter searches, e.g., helium, fluorine, argon and xenon. These studies will determine the optimal gas mixtures, pressures and other experimental parameters for a Migdal experiment. The TPC R&D proposed here will impact other research areas beyond searches for the Migdal effect. Applications that could benefit from the high 3D resolution tracking of the NID TPC include directional dark matter searches, measurements of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, X-ray polarimetry and directional neutron detection."

The representation of clouds in even the most sophisticated climate models remains a challenge and, as a result, cloud properties represent the largest source of error in our estimates of climate sensitivity. Detailed, precise, and accurate measurements of cloud microphysical characteristics remain in short supply and high spatial resolution measurements of cloud properties from flight-based platforms would improve our understanding of cloud microphysics, ultimately resulting in a better representation of clouds in climate models. An advanced instrument based on phase-Doppler interferometry capable of measuring droplet size and velocity with very high accuracy is being developed to provide high spatial resolution measurements of cloud properties. This instrument has the unique advantage over competing instruments in that the issue of coincidence, when more than one particle resides in the sample volume, may be resolved. The overall objective is to increase the sample volume by multiple orders of magnitude without compromising measurement accuracy while providing 1-meter spatial resolution of cloud properties during in-flight acquisition. During Phase I, it was demonstrated that the described instrument is capable of simultaneously measuring droplet size and velocity for a wide range of sizes and velocities with very high accuracy. Increasing the sample volume by a factor of 30 to 100 times was investigated and found to be feasible. To avoid or minimize errors due to coincidence, an advanced signal detection approach along with signal parsing was proposed and evaluated. This approach allows the recovery of individual particle signals for coincident events. Algorithms to control the probability of coincidence and adapt the instrument to prevailing conditions were developed. Methods to characterize the effective probe volume and validate flux and liquid water content measurements were developed. During Phase II, methods to increase the probe volume to allow for high data rate acquisition will continue to be developed and refined and a breadboard optical system will be constructed for further testing. Probe volume will be characterized over a broad range of configurations and flux and liquid water content measurements will be validated for a complete range of conditions. A fully autonomous instrument that can be easily operated in a wide range of applications by users without prior knowledge of operating principles will be developed. The described instrument will allow characterization of microscale turbulence from tethered balloons. Other industries that rely on spray characterization will also benefit from this technology, including the development of anti-viral sprays, pharmaceutical inhalers, agricultural spray technologies, and inkjet printing technologies."

The major work elements support General Atomics’ (GA) leadership of research within the DIII-D National Fusion Program, operation of the DIII-D National Fusion Facility, research in Advanced Fusion Technology, and management of the U.S. Burning Plasma Organization (USBPO). The DIII-D Five-Year Program Plan was developed by the DIII-D International Team, consisting of over 450 scientific and technical staff from 83 institutions worldwide that carry out research at the DIII-D National Facility. General Atomics manages and operates the DIII-D National Fusion Facility for the U.S. Department of Energy. DIII-D is the largest magnetic fusion facility in the U.S. The mission of the Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) Program is to expand the fundamental understanding of matter at very high temperatures and densities and to develop the scientific foundations needed to develop a fusion energy source. In support of the FES mission, the DIII-D National Fusion Program mission is to establish the scientific basis for the optimization of the tokamak approach to fusion energy production. This research effort directly supports the FES strategic goal to advance the fundamental science of magnetically confined plasmas to develop the predictive capability needed for a sustainable fusion energy source. The DIII-D Five-Year Program Plan outlines research to advance fundamental understanding and predictive capability in order to prepare for burning plasma experiments in ITER. The research addresses five targeted research challenges: (1) develop and qualify edge localized mode (ELM) control for ITER, (2) meet the disruption challenge for ITER, (3) improve confidence in transport predictions for the burning plasma regime, (4) demonstrate the potential of high ß steady-state tokamak operation, and (5) develop advanced heat dispersal concepts for next-step devices compatible with high core performance. These research challenges are well-aligned with the key research needs for magnetic fusion energy identified in the DOE-FES Research Needs Workshop Report. To carry out this research, the tokamak will be operated each year to support the planned DIII-D experiments and a number of facility improvements will be completed. The facility improvements could include increased electron cyclotron heating power, a second off-axis neutral beam, higher beam power, new internal coils for 3D field physics research, new power supplies for ELM control and ITER shaping studies, and new diagnostic capabilities. With these upgrades, DIII-D will provide an excellent platform for fusion scientists to conduct world-leading scientific research in support of U.S. participation in ITER. Successful execution of the research plan will also inform design, construction, and operation of a potential future Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF). The planned Advanced Fusion Technology Research and Development effort will advance the scientific knowledge base for next generation fusion experiments. GA’s work in Fusion Materials, Plasma Facing Components, Nuclear Science and Technology, RF Technologies, Fusion Power Plant and the FNSF Design Initiative is coordinated with the U.S. Virtual Laboratory for Technology. In this research effort General Atomics supports the USBPO by conducting experiments to address research needs identified by the USBPO, reporting results to ITER, providing staff who serve in leadership positions, and providing support for the Director of the organization."

The PGDL approach injects a deep neural network with process knowledge in the forms of process-based model inputs, architectural constraints, training data, and/or feedback during model training. PGDL has shown exceptional accuracy in preliminary applications to predict lake and river water temperatures and river discharges, with better generalizability than other deep learning methods for predictions in new locations and time periods. However, PGDL has been implemented in diverse and sometimes incompatible ways, and deep learning methods continue to evolve rapidly, such that there is much potential to introduce new PGDL techniques, and assess and optimize existing ones, to achieve even better performance for environmental prediction. PGDL will be applied in this project to predict water temperature, an ecological master variable governing rates of biological activity, chemical reactions, and habitat suitability in stream and river networks. USGS project members will collaborate on two of the six themes of the larger, multi-institution ExaSheds project also funded by DOE: Theme 3, hybrid ML-physics models for hydrology, and Theme 6, demonstration and integration. Collaboration on Theme 3 will explore new PGDL techniques in the context of recent but separate successes by several team members in the areas of hybrid Bayesian neural networks, high-resolution process-based temperature modeling, multifidelity modeling, and process-guided model architectures and training procedures. Collaboration on Theme 6 will yield multi-decadal PGDL projections for scenarios of climate change, land use change, and/or extreme events such as droughts and heat waves. Our overarching goal is to push past the limits of current PGDL methods, achieving deeper integration of process knowledge and greater reliability of projections, to support evidence-based decision making in a changing world."

Intricate lattice structures, for example, can be produced through additive manufacturing and allow engineers to optimize material distribution and load carrying to achieve superior strength- to-weight ratios. However, additive manufacturing has seen limited adoption for structural and mission-critical parts, largely because additive structures (such as lattices) are often too complex for their behavior to be accurately predicted by commercial finite element analysis software. To enable broader deployment of additive manufacturing requires a significant enhancement to simulation capabilities. This SBIR Phase II project will facilitate the certification, through computer simulation, of additively manufactured lattice structures, to a scale not previously possible. The highly qualified team will develop and commercialize a novel, spline-based, GPU-accelerated simulation technology for lattice structures in additive manufacturing. In Phase I of this project, the team demonstrated a proof of concept for this approach. They showed that this approach easily scales to a lattice structure that is over three times larger than the current industry limit. Phase I also saw the development of a proof of concept, integrated design-through-simulation pipeline for structural lattice design and simulation based on proprietary technology, and the development of a proprietary method that dramatically decreases the meshing burden common to existing industrial lattice simulation techniques. Finally, in Phase I it was established that, with virtually zero meshing burden and far fewer degrees of freedom, simulation results can be achieved that are essentially identical to results from traditional methods. In Phase II and beyond, these capabilities will be further developed with input from commercial partners to refine them for industry needs. GPUs will be leveraged to scale the product for wider use and larger problems. When fully developed, this project will allow industry users to significantly decrease their dependence on physical prototyping. 3D printing industry leaders supported and provided feedback to the Phase I effort and continue to see this approach as a potential “holy grail” to unlock the benefits of structural FEA to 3D printing at scale for the first time. These benefits include faster time to market, lightweighting for reduced fuel consumption, and cost-effective low-volume parts. This technology is anticipated to support not only an explosion in the volume of parts and components that can be 3D printed once computer simulation is possible, but also an increase in innovation and creativity leading to entirely new and unanticipated categories of 3D printing."

By means of photosynthesis, plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert the radiant energy of sunlight into chemical potential energy, producing food and feed for virtually all organisms as well as precursors for liquid fuels. In photosynthesis, photosystem II (PS II) carries out the light-driven cleavage of water to generate oxygen and extract the electrons and protons necessary for the synthesis of biomolecules. PS II owes its remarkable water-splitting chemistry to the catalytic prowess of its manganese cluster, which enables it to harness the potential of two virtually inexhaustible raw materials: sunlight and water. The valuable water-oxidation property of PS II, however, is also its weakness. Under intense sunlight or stress, incomplete water oxidation and charge recombination events produce reactive oxygen species that modify a number of key amino acid residues in the reaction center proteins of PS II. This proposal seeks to understand how plant PS II repairs its photodamaged reaction center core and the role of protein phosphorylation in this process. We propose that core phosphorylation releases the peripheral antenna complement from the reaction center core, decreasing reaction center damage in high light. We further suggest that phosphorylation at additional key sites trigger disassembly of the dimeric core, facilitating the repair of the damaged reaction center. The proposed research will test these hypotheses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our approach involves the study of PS II antenna size and light harvesting as a function of core phosphorylation. Mutant plants that have higher or lower levels of core phosphorylation will be examined for impaired antenna size adjustment and PS II repair. Using chloroplast genetic transformation techniques, we will replace core phosphosites with alanine or the phosphomimetic glutamate residues. These mutants will be critical in testing the predicted existence of antenna dissociation and core monomerization phosphosites. We further aim to calculate the interaction energy between antenna and core at their precise in vivo phosphorylation stoichiometries. Nearly 70% of the productivity loss in major crop plants results from abiotic factors that impair PS II function and photosynthesis. PS II damage additionally manifests itself as the source of the characteristic midday depression of photosynthesis. The studies proposed here will inform our understanding of the light harvesting strategy, self-repair, and molecular assembly of PS II. These studies will thereby illuminate the design of an optimal antenna system and a light tolerant PS II. The overall objective of this proposal is to foster greater fundamental knowledge of the structure and function of PS II and to determine the physical and chemical rules that underlie the biological mechanisms of its photo-protective and self-repair pathways."

In this proposal, Adámas, Inc. in partnership with Rivis, Inc. proposes to use an atmospheric pressure plasma for the surface treatment of diamond nanoparticles (DNP) containing color centers in order to significantly enhance their performance as quantum sensors. Diamond particles containing optically active nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have gained significant attention due to their unique optoelectronic properties that facilitate their use as sensors across many fields. The implications for fossil energy applications are sweeping, where measurement of observables such as pressure, temperature, and pH/corrosion are envisioned for monitoring of power grids, oil refining processes, pipeline integrity, coal mine safety, among many others. The fundamental physical principle to all signal enhancement and detection schemes is manipulation of the electronic spin state of the NV center, which primarily has two charge states: a neutral state, NV0, and a negatively charged state, NV-, possessing an electron spin. It is desirable that the negative charge state exists for shallow NV centers for be utilized in sensing. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that surface termination is critical for the negative charge stabilization of these quantum centers to maximize sensitivity, where fluorination or nitridation (full-N) are the best terminations providing positive electron affinity preserving negative charge state of shallow NV centers. These functionalities are difficult to achieve via conventional wet chemistry methods, especially on nanoparticles. The plasma is generated via Rivis’ patented plasma self-tuning dielectric barrier system where a rapid risetime high voltage pulse creates an overvoltage allowing electric field applied across the gas filled dielectric electrode gap to reach values two to three times the breakdown value of the gas before discharge formation. These plasma conditions are well-suited for promoting formation of reactive species for fluorine and nitrogen functionalization. Thus, the major objectives of the project are to (1) Develop a deeper insight into the plasma conditions that promote generation of reactive species leading to the high level of functionalization of DNP; (2) Demonstrate the general applicability of the plasma system for the functionalization of nano-materials with the attachment of fluorine, and nitrogen groups to DNP; and (3) Develop approach for plasma treatment of large volumes of DNP suitable for quantum sensors to be pursued in Phase II."

Knowing the absolute concentration of LTP RS in time and in space remains one of the most challenging yet most important LTP diagnostic tasks. This challenge is further compounded when an LTP source is set for interactions with a wet medium, e.g., a biological surface, where the interface between the plasma gas and the liquid (or solution) forms a time- and space-dependent multiphase reaction zone (or interfacial reaction zone). To date, the behavior of the RS, such as transport and diffusion, formation and loss, etc., in this interfacial reaction zone is virtually unexplored, largely due to technical challenges. This challenge hinders our understanding the complicated physics, gas dynamics, and heterogeneous chemistry of LTP in the complex settings. The proposal is to demonstrate measurements of time-, space-, and molecule-resolved multi-RS in complex LTP settings using the cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS) technique. The primary goal of this (Category-1) 2-year project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the innovative approach by measuring RS (OH and NO) in the most challenging settings: right on the surface of water and under water. With a success of this project, the overarching goal of a follow-up Category-2 project is to integrate this innovative CRDS system with other diagnostic techniques for comprehensive diagnostics of LTP in a single fully integrated diagnostic facility. The intellectual merit of the project lies in: 1) The absolute number density measurement of gaseous plasma RS in liquid, 2) Measuring gaseous molecules in liquid using the CRDS technique, 3) The proposed CRDS system has a high spatial and temporal resolution and measures absolute number density of multiple species, and 4) The special reaction cell allows direct interactions of selected UV light and or plasma with water for the study of time- and space- resolved number density and reaction dynamics. The broader impact lies in the enhancement of the diagnostics/measurement capability of LTP. This innovative measuring technique will enable scientist and engineers to quantity RS in complex settings. Modelers, experimentalists, and the LTP industry will benefit from this research. Several graduate students, some are likely from underrepresented groups, will receive trainings in plasma, lasers, optics, and reaction kinetics directly or indirectly. One second year PhD student will be involved in the proposed activities."

Orlov, University of California San Diego (Co-Investigator) This project extends the predictive capabilities of non-axisymmetric (3D) field physics with integrated scenario optimizations to demonstrate the scientific feasibility of 3D magnetic perturbations for transport and instability control in long-pulse high-performance tokamak plasmas. A key example of this is the suppression of the edge-localized-modes (ELMs) by resonant 3D magnetic perturbations (RMPs). ELMs constitute a major challenge to the operation of fusion-grade tokamak plasmas such as ITER due to the large transient heat loads they deliver to plasma facing components (PFCs). US scientists have pioneered the development of the 3D-field approach to ELM control since its first discovery and have a crucial role in exporting the technique to international facilities such as the KSTAR tokamak in Korea, the EAST tokamak in China, and the AUG tokamak in Germany. Recent international collaborations have enabled the project team to compile comprehensive 3D databases, develop testable criteria for the accessibility and threshold conditions of ELM suppression, improve understanding of underlying particle transport for predicting pedestal profile modifications and heat flux to PFCs, and adaptively control 3D fields to restore confinement under ELM suppression. These recent accomplishments have exposed opportunities for the US scientists to resolve remaining challenges, such as the compatibility of 3D ELM suppression with core optimized scenarios as well as heat loads to PFCs for long pulses. Enhanced physics models, databases, and experimental analysis infrastructures developed by this project team will be all leveraged utilizing the strong partnerships among the multi-institutional US groups and international collaborators. Predictive capabilities for 3D edge perturbations, transport, and ELM suppression will be validated over international databases with analysis utilizing US cutting-edge 3D simulations. Intelligent control algorithms for the 3D field operational windows and associated profile alterations will be developed and integrated into TRANSP for long pulse optimization. This novel ‘3D TRANSP’ will be tested and refined on KSTAR with the new tungsten divertors, in preparation for ITER applications. In parallel, the 3D field physics basis will be extended to optimize fast ion losses and heat flux to divertors. Understanding of turbulent transport across 3D magnetic topologies including edge and core island chains as well as stochastic field lines will also be extended. All these developments will be integrated to establish optimized long pulse scenarios with 3D fields in KSTAR. The predictive 3D scenario optimizations will be then combined with real-time, actively probing, adaptive controllers to demonstrate ELM-free H-mode scenarios in KSTAR for long pulses of up to 300s with ??N>2.0, minimal core MHD, maximized confinement, and minimized heat loads to plasma facing components."

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been considered the ultimate method to produce hydrogen as well as other fuels, directly from solar radiation. The process is simple and has potential for high conversion efficiency and low operating temperatures using cost-effective thin-film and/or particle semiconductor materials. Late R&D activities resulted in remarkable PEC system improvements in terms of efficiency, durability, and lifetime. One of the key components of the PEC system is the membrane separator, which still requires additional development to improve high ionic transport, reduced gas permeability, and elevated stability in corrosive and acidic environments. Greenway Energy (GWE), in conjunction with the University of South Carolina (U of SC), proposes the development of a novel polymeric membrane class, referred to as acid-doped dense polybenzimidazole (D- PBI) membrane, to be employed in a monolithically integrated PEC system for hydrogen production. The proposed membranes will allow the PEC system to operate at higher temperatures (on the order of 200 °C), resulting in remarkable increase of the overall hydrogen production efficiency, reduction of kinetic overpotential and increase of reactive mixture diffusion in the vapor phase. The work carried out in Phase 1 will focus on: (1) synthesis and production of novel polybenzimidazole membranes based on acid-doped formulations (D-PBI), (2) comprehensive characterization of the proposed membranes, both in terms of mechanical/structural properties and in terms of electrochemical properties, including initial durability performance testing, (3) screening of the main promising formulations, achieving selected targets, including proton conductivity, hydrogen and oxygen permeability, current density and performance degradation and (4) initial testing of the down selected membrane formulations, integrated in a simplified PEC device, under transient conditions and simulated on-sun conditions. Phase 2 work will be based on Phase 1 results and will aim to perform: (1) comprehensive testing of the membranes, including long term (> 1500 hours) durability testing, (2) identification of the interaction with current and novel photocatalysts, screened through a high-throughput approach, and (3) on-sun testing of a one-cell PEC device. The work will be carried out with the NREL (for membrane and PEC testing) and ANL (for photocatalyst development in Phase 2). The achievement of the proposed targets in the project will allow a comprehensive and definitive demonstration of novel separation membranes, based on the PBI configuration. The proposed membranes, initially developed and adopted for PEC devices, will also be employed in many different applications, ranging from traditional water electrolyzers to solar driven PEC for fuel (e.g., hydrocarbons) production. The activities will be carried out leveraging the outcomes and inputs from the DOE-EERE HydroGEN 2.0 Consortium, finding solutions for producing hydrogen, with direct coupling with solar inputs."

The nature of actinide-ligand interactions in these molecules is poorly understood and by deconvoluting the factors involved in bonding we have the potential to gain unprecedented control of these multifaceted elements that play critical roles in nuclear energy production, defense, and in our fundamental understanding of electronic structure. Thus, experimental and computational methods for quantifying the nature of the chemical bond in these systems will be utilized, and high pressures will be applied to adjust their character. In all cases there is feedback between experiment and quantum mechanical theory so that these changes can be understood and enhanced. Our hypotheses are that 1a) the bonding and perhaps even the intrinsic nature of the ground and excited states of actinides can be substantially modified through ligation by chelators that possess large hyperpolarizabilities because the polarization of electron density allows for the creation of covalent bonds even in systems that are almost entirely ionic. 1b) that the electron density in An?L bonds can be quantified using charge-density X-ray diffraction techniques. 2) In both these and simpler complexes the nature of the An?L bonds can transformed by compression under high pressures because frontier metal orbitals can be engaged to a greater degree than possible under ambient conditions and orbital mixing can also be enhanced. 3) Chiral, biologically-derived ionophores can be used to create enantiopure actinide complexes that will aid in spectroscopic evaluation of actinide-ligand interactions. Thus, these hypotheses all represent different approaches to understanding bonding heavy element compounds. If these postulates are correct we should observe spectroscopic features, magnetic behavior, and bond metrics different from that found in currently known in actinide complexes.

The resulting materials have biological functions as diverse as structural support, filtration, grinding and cutting, light-harvesting, gravity sensing, and magnetic guidance. The processes that lead to the formation of crystals within the organic tissues are collectively known as biomineralization. Biominerals can have different forms within the organic matrix and occur as nanophase particle aggregates, topologically complex single-crystals, and sophisticated multi-layer composites. An understanding of biomineralization processes is directly relevant to the mission of the Department of Energy. The artificial sequestration and carbon storage require a fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical controls on biomineral-related crystal formation. Nature provides important insights by capturing carbon into calcium carbonate (biomineral) sediments for millions of years. Biomineralization influences global biogeochemical cycles and regulates characteristics of seawater chemistry. An understanding of the unique material properties of biomineral structures, and their processes of formation, also presents opportunities to develop new strategies for the synthesis of novel products with applications to wide-ranging material and energy technologies. Our previous research into the physical basis of biomineralization has contributed many new insights into the fundamental processes that control mineral nucleation and growth. Our findings have already led to discoveries that revised conventional thinking about how crystals nucleate, grow, and dissolve. We have made significant progress toward understanding how organic molecules control the difficulty of forming calcite and modify the resulting crystals’ shapes and properties. We also have learned how the properties of surfaces can be tuned to encourage or inhibit mineral formation and made pioneering new insights into the formation of diverse minerals by particle-mediated growth processes. This research project focuses on understanding how the organic matrix controls the formation of calcium carbonate crystals. By collaborating across geosciences, sustainable biopolymer chemistry, and materials chemistry, we will prepare chitosan hydrogels with tailored compositions to use as simple models for the biomineralization settings found in living organisms. Our research investigates (1) controls of the degree of substitution of sulfated groups; (2) controls of variable substitution of other biological functional groups- phosphate, carboxylate, hydroxyl groups; (3) their cooperative interactions. With this physical basis, we will investigate how organic molecules can be tuned to create patterned biominerals, such as seen in animal structures. Our approaches include controlled synthesis of tailored chitosan-based hydrogels, hydrogel and crystal structural characterization, synchrotron-based x-rays, in situ AFM and optical measurements of nucleation rates on tailored hydrogels, dynamic force spectroscopy measurements of crystal-crystal and crystal-substrate binding free energies, and in situ TEM investigations of nucleation and aggregation during nanoparticle attachment. Our cross-cutting research plan is directly relevant to the Department of Energy’s mission to understand chemical transformations in multiple application areas. The project plan contributes to these goals with a focus on (1) Basic research of carbonate biogenesis and mineral-water interaction processes; (2) Fundamental processes at atomic and molecular scales; (3) Interactions of minerals and fluids that affect the partitioning of organic and inorganic carbon in the subsurface and marine ‘repository’ environments; (4) Knowledge of how natural products can be emulated as sources or model compounds for the tailored crystallization of inorganic materials for new energy technologies. The findings will allow us to test current theories of mineral formation that are relevant to both natural and engineered environments while also advancing a new understanding of mineralization processes in hydrogel-hosted materials."

The hyporheic zone is a critical environmental interface where groundwater and surface water meet.

The need for an improved understanding of how turbulence influences transport processes at the SWI has been clearly identified in the scientific literature, and is currently the subject of significant research. This work will combinine experiments, theory, and numerical methods to characterize and understand complex flows, particularly in systems near the sediment-water inteface (e.g., river bottom) where hyporheic exchange happens. In the proposed research, we will use a combination of these resources to directly observe the phenomena in question at the pore scale, to understand the phenomena via high-resolution numerical modeling, and to develop the multi-scale process models needed to correctly represent hyporheic zone transport phenomena. The proposed research will investigate turbulent flow over bed forms (both flat and sloped, permeable and impermable) to quantify turbulence penetration into the hyporheic zone. The proposed work combines the following collaborative research components. Time-resolved, three-component particle-image velocimetry measurements using index-of-refraction matching between the solid and fluid phases. Predictive numerical simulations of turbulence based on a combination of large eddy simulation and direct numerical simulation methods. The development of appropriate boundary conditions for mass and momentum transport (via the method of volume averaging) for applications to large-scale hydrologic models (e.g. PFLOTRAN). Project Approach. Our research is hypothesis-driven. In summary, our hypotheses are organized around the following. The effects of macroscopic bed shape as it influences both the turbulent structure above the SWI, and the occurrence of induced flow within the sediments. The propensity for coherent turbulent structures to increase the rates of momentum and mass transport across the SWI by mechanisms that are not captured by pre-averaged (e.g., Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations) models. Methods to use formal upscaling to develop the appropriate momentum and mass jump boundary conditions for the SWI so that scientifically-sound representations can be adopted in large-scale hydrologic models such as PFLOTRAN. Potential Impact. Current models of hyporheic exchange approximate turbulent flows in a mean sense only. This research will assess the impacts of that approximation, and provide new upscaled representations of the SWI boundary for use in mechanistic simulations in large-scale hydrologic models. Our proposed research directly addresses scientifically-relevant questions of high priority associated with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Scientific Focus Area, and we will seek to collaborate with researchers at ."
Energy-Efficient Self-Organization and Swarm Behavior in Active Matter,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020971,"sacanna, stefano",stefano.sacanna@newyorkuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Living systems have the unique ability to form hierarchical assemblies, in which individual constituents can perform tasks cooperatively and emergently. For instance, in Nature, birds may fly in flocks and develop emergent behaviors that result in complex motions and interactions. Similarly, bacteria are active particles that can form assemblies such as bacterial biofilms that are known to play a major role in certain forms of cancer. Harnessing such properties is a long- standing challenge for the rational design of dynamic materials, that can respond to their environment, communicate with one another, and undergo a rapid, reversible, assembly through the transduction of energy. Recent developments in the design of smart and active colloidal building blocks have led to tremendous breakthroughs, with, for instance, the onset of synthetic photoactivated active assemblies known as “living crystals” that can form, break, explode and re- form elsewhere. The goal of this proposal is to develop a combined experimental, computational, and theoretical framework to shed light on the physical underpinnings of such assembly processes and program the assembly of smart active materials. Our recent work on equilibrium systems has shown that entropy is an efficient collective variable to measure how organized, or disorganized, a system can be. It also provides a great deal of information on the amount of energy that can flow into or out a given system. This approach can be readily extended to active assemblies, by applying, for instance, pattern recognition algorithms and machine learning methods. We also showed that nonequilibrium entropies can be calculated using compression algorithms. This method provides a nonequilibrium alternative to the Shannon entropy and is closely related to the algorithmic approach to information, known as Kolmogorov complexity. Our recent results provide a route to create colloidal building blocks with reconfigurable shapes and tailored functionalities. Indeed, chemical- and light-stimulated dewetting mechanisms can be used to synthesize particles that can swim and sense each other from self and cooperative phoresis, giving rise to “living crystals” and “rotors”. A novel aspect of our proposal will be the design of different active particles that act like controllable micron scale “robots”, not individually controllable but controllable collectively with lights and magnetic fields to form Turing patterns, swarm around objects they sense chemically, phoretically or magnetically or swarm into reconfigurable shapes. Our proposal relies on a closed loop approach that builds on our combined expertise and involves (i) the design of new colloidal building blocks that are shape-changing, reconfigurable, and light-activated dual-engine particles, whose state can be dynamically switched between swimming, spinning or inactive, (ii) the identification of the features of the assembly process through nonequilibrium particle-based computer simulations, specifically nonequilibrium Brownian dynamics, as well as simulations methods that couple the active colloidal building blocks to a Lattice-Boltzmann approach for the solvent and, in turn, account for hydrodynamics, (iii) deciphering the intelligence-information link by subjecting both experimental and simulation data on the formation of novel active assemblies to a Kolmogorov analog of the Turing test, and (iv) the use of machine (reinforcement) learning to control the assembly of active colloidal materials with the desired properties. Findings from this research will have wide-ranging implications for biomaterials, by providing new insights into active biological assembly, and in micro-robotics, by identifying novel strategies to design smart active materials."

In many organic molecules, the ensuing dynamics involve pathways that are in competition with direct dissociation on the excited state, e.g., couplings to lower potential energy surfaces, isomerization, photo&shy;tautomerization, and secondary reactive collisions. Because photodissociation is usually fast (picose&shy;conds to microseconds), these processes are far from equilibrium and are controlled by kinetic competi&shy;tion and dynamical forces. This proposal is focused on the photochemistry of alpha-keto carboxylic acids, a group of acids produced from natural sources, which are implicated in aerosol formation and biological processes. In the atmosphere, they are destroyed mainly by solar radiation. Studying their photochemistry has been surprisingly difficult because of the complexity of their excited electronic states, and the effects of colli&shy;sions and secondary reactions. The proposed studies focus on a model molecule in this series, pyruvic acid, which is amenable to detailed exploration and theoretical modeling. Like other members of the series, it comprises a carbonyl, a carboxylic group, and an alkyl group, with the car&shy;bonyl serving as chromophore. It also has an internal hydrogen bond that controls the evolution of its unimolecular reac&shy;tion, and it has keto and enol tautomers. The three lowest excited singlet states of pyruvic acid will be reached by laser irradiation at 351 and 193 nm, and the photodissociation dynamics will be compared in the absence and presence of collisions. Understanding the UV photochemistry requires the use of complementary experimental approaches and the support of theory. For these studies, three methods will be enlisted in order to generate a comprehensive and detailed set of results: (i) The time-sliced velo&shy;city map imaging (SVMI) instrument at USC will be exploited to determine kinetic energy release of fragments, fast dissociation timescales, and internal state distributions of fragments for which Resonance Enhanced Multiphoton Ioniza&shy;tion (REMPI) schemes exist; (ii) The multiplexed photoionization mass spectro&shy;meter (MPIMS) setup developed at the Sandia Combustion Research Facility will be used for product discovery (including isomers and tautomers), achieved by exploiting tunable narrowband VUV radiation at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), and follow in time their subsequent unimolecular and bimolecular reactions; (iii) The laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) setup at USC will be configured for measuring time-resolved fluorescence and/or phosphorescence up to ~ 100 microseconds. The experimental condi&shy;tions will range from collisionless molecular beams to flow reactors of variable pressure. The experiments with the MPIMS instrument will be done in collaboration with Dr. David Osborn, Sandia Combustion Research Facility. Specifically in the next funding period we plan to determine: the lifetime of the first singlet state and how it is affected by collisions; the electronic properties of the three lowest excited singlet electronic states, and they control dissociation path&shy;ways and dynamics; the importance of collisions and secondary reactions, especially with water, on excited state lifetime and the competition among dissociation pathways; the importance of three-body fragmentation processes; and the role of keto-enol photo-tautomeri&shy;zation reactions. Collaborations with theoreticians are essential to elucidating photodissociation mechanisms and follo&shy;wing the dynamics, and they will continue with collaborators at USC and elsewhere."

The project is organized into four scientific subtasks. The first two subtasks focus on advancing fundamental science in radiation chemistry. From energy deposition to medium decomposition starts by considering the optical response of the medium to these irradiations, then probes primary events searching for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind low-energy-electron-induced fragmentations from the gas phase to droplets and on interfaces. Track structure models are extended to account for the extreme environments mentioned above, in addition to high LET. Differences in radiolytic yields in O-heterocyclic aromatics and aliphatics are assessed. How radiation chemistry impacts key modern structural characterization techniques, involving electron microscopy and macromolecular crystallography at synchrotrons and X-ray free-electrons lasers, and the observations in electron energy-loss spectroscopies is interrogated next. This subtask concludes with an exploration of a non-traditional radiation source, the atmospheric pressure plasma jet. Probing radical structure and kinetics is a subtask that tackles radical structure and reactivity at a fundamental level, developing and employing experimental and theoretical techniques to elucidate the observed behaviors. Particular challenges that will be addressed include reactions and reduction potentials of hyper-reduced transition metal ions, the chemistry of reactive chlorine species, free radicals of thioureas and thiopyrimidines, optically detected EPR of model photoresist compounds, investigation of solvated electron structure and reaction rates, resonance Raman study of radical ion hydration shells, and quantitative measurement and modeling of the magnetic properties of aqueous hydrogen atoms. Nuclear power is a vital resource in meeting our future energy needs and an important part of the portfolio of the Department of Energy’s efforts to provide safe and reliable sources of electricity. Through a third subtask of this project, the NDRL will provide essential knowledge uncovering radiation chemistry’s impact on nuclear power generation for the management and further development of this key energy source. The complex radiation chemistry of the borate radical at the high temperatures of pressurized water reactors will be examined along with radiation-accelerated corrosion of zircaloy and chemistry at the interfaces of new reactor cladding materials. More efficient and less expensive separation processes for spent radioactive materials will be explored by identifying radiation-induced organic radicals and the effects of high acid nitrate conditions. Safe long-term storage of radioactive materials requires extensive information on the radiation stability of metal oxides in association with organics. Investigations into resonance Raman of intermediates on interfaces and gas production from waste materials will aid in long-term stewardship. A complementary fourth subtask aims to understand the conversion of visible photons into electrical and chemical energy by probing charge-transfer processes in light-harvesting assemblies. The NDRL will establish the mechanism of triplet-triplet energy transfer in 2D and 3D semiconductor-chromophore assemblies. Spectroelectrochemical and radiation-based chemical methods will be employed to probe the role of trap and active sites influencing the overall photoactivity of semiconductor heterostructures by selectively injecting holes or electrons."

The lead-PI, a practitioner of quantum calculations for solids, has been collaborating with electron-beam microscopists to extract the physics underlying the experimental data. Vibrations have so far been the realm of light-based microscopes, which, however, do not have as high spatial resolution. The two approaches are complementary. Theory can serve as a bridge to the atomic scale. The lead-PI and scanning-tip optical microscopist Josh Caldwell at Vanderbilt University and electron-beam microscopist Jordan Hachtel of Oak Ridge National Laboratory will team up to investigate the way light propagates in materials by coupling to atomic vibrations, morphing into “phonon polaritons”, quasi-particles that hold promise for unique applications. The lead PI will also engage with Hachtel and other materials scientists to apply microscopy and theory to investigate emergent vibrational properties of nanostructures (properties that are very different from those of the constituent materials). Another focus will be “cryo-STEM”, which enables to probe materials and nanostructures at cryogenic temperatures. The outcomes will extend our understanding of the structure of materials and nanostructures and how the structure links to properties, with special emphasis on vibrational properties and the coupling of infrared light to vibrations in highly anisotropic materials. The latter will expand opportunities for novel applications in nanophotonics."

Rappe University of Pennsylvania We propose a course of theoretical and computational research targeted at developing a comprehensive catalyst design approach and applying this approach to important catalytic reactions. The investigations will encompass material stability and parasitic side reactions, as well as in-depth mechanistic investigations of the desired catalytic processes. At the heart of our proposed study lies a novel and tunable class of catalytic materials: hybrid oxide/phosphide systems consisting of ultra-thin supported oxides on metallic phosphides. We will show that we can screen a wide range of promising hybrid systems, with the goal of identifying industrially-viable CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalysts capable of stable, efficient, and selective operation in real-world conditions. Ultimately, the deployment of such a catalyst can advance the economic viability and availability of renewable fuels and high-value chemicals from CO2. In the last couple of decades, developments in theoretical catalysis have revealed some of the fundamental limitations on the catalytic activity/selectivity of conventional materials. Hence, in addition to the materials design aspect of our proposal, we also plan to show the importance of searching in the vast design space of complex multicomponent hybrid systems in order to circumvent the fundamental limitations currently hindering the advancement of state-of-the-art catalysts for important reactions such as CO2RR. Additionally, we will advance our physical chemistry and machine learning techniques to accurately describe this broad class of catalytic materials, reduce the computational cost, interpret our results, and help create fundamental physical/chemical insight from our rational materials design/screening process. We will adopt a multi-pronged strategy to achieve our objectives, encompassing fundamental method development, materials design, detailed mechanistic studies of catalytic phenomena, the important role of surface reconstructions, and the rate-enhancing effect of electrolytes by creating favorable catalytic micro-environments. Our proposed road map to accomplish these includes new methods development, study of complex catalytic mechanisms, codesign of surfaces and mechanisms, and design of microenvironment and system, each of which is further discussed separately in subsections of this proposal. We will develop new computational methods and protocols to render materials discovery more efficient, accurate, and applicable to a wider range of complex materials. Using such methods, we will investigate complex catalytic reaction networks and bias our stable materials search process to find the best materials to optimize such networks for high activity and selectivity toward desired reactions. For instance, we will further modify/enhance our recently-invented ab initio grand canonical Monte Carlo (aiGCMC) based algorithm to generate complex and realistic surface reconstructions, and to efficiently search within these for hybrid surface motifs that can lead to enhanced electrocatalysis. Our catalyst codesign of catalytic surfaces harnesses our advances in complex CO2RR mechanistic insight and surface stability arguments while also linking to solvent engineering approaches (e.g., via rate-enhancing ionic liquids) to further design the catalytic microenvironment and push catalysts toward greater activity, selectivity, and stability."

Successful, development of new radionuclide production techniques has made it easier to incorporate these radionuclides into new, improved pharmaceuticals. Radioisotopes of scandium are of particular interest thanks to prior, successful DOE-funded efforts, but they currently lack a convincing demonstration of radiolabeling and application in a form that can easily be moved to the clinic. We believe that exciting Sc-based radiopharmaceuticals have been impeded by a significant gap in our knowledge of how scandium interacts with the chemistry of these drugs in environmental conditions like those in the human body. The collaboration between Stony Brook University and the University of Wisconsin has already discovered new and interesting scandium chemical principles help to explain the current deficiencies in Sc-based radiopharmaceuticals and suggest radiochemical techniques that can be used to remedy them. We propose to fabricate and test in vivo novel generators of radioactive scandium that feed kit-style pharmaceutical preparations of 44gSc-labeled. The scandium radionuclides already possess physical and radiochemical properties that are superior to current clinical standards of care; our work will dramatically magnify opportunities for clinical incorporation of DOE produced scandium radioisotopes for medical applications."

However, a phenomenon of “training” has baffled superconducting magnet designers for over 50 years. Training usually refers to a process of gradually improving maximal current that the superconducting high-field magnet can sustain. At the maximal current the magnet would develop resistance and quickly release is stored energy in a process called “quenching”. Repetitive quenching typically leads to a gradual increase of the quench current. Since in practice dozens of quenches may be needed to reach the magnet design current, training is a costly and time-consuming procedure that every newly constructed magnet has to undergo prior to its intended use. Reduction of training is thus one of the key standing problems in the field. It is believed that mechanical degradation of coil materials such as epoxy impregnation cracking and de-lamination along the conductor interfaces play a crucial role in defining length of training and performance limitations. An ability to non-destructively localize and identify these mechanical flaws in magnets would provide a valuable insight for magnet designers and help them to better understand and mitigate training. Present project aims at developing such diagnostic capability using ultrasonic diagnostics. Ultrasonic testing is a proven technique for non-destructively evaluating and imaging flaws within a wide range of complex structures, and the proposing small business has extensive experience solving challenging NDE problems using novel ultrasonic methods. For this project, the proposing firm will partner with a national research laboratory to explore various ultrasonic approaches including high-frequency, conventional, “bulk wave” ultrasound as well as lower-frequency “guided wave” ultrasound in both pulse-echo and through-transmission test configurations scanning from the outside of the magnet and from within the core. The proposing team will leverage superconducting magnet specimens with known mechanical flaws as well as the subject matter expertise available at the research institution to develop practical solutions for this application. The primary objective of the proposed SBIR/STTR effort is to develop an ultrasonic scanning method(s) applied from within the magnet core and from outside the magnet shell that is capable of characterizing the presence, location, extent, type, and severity of the mechanical degradation. The research institution will provide access to superconducting magnet specimens with varying degrees of mechanical degradation as well as invaluable subject matter expertise on the design and operation of the magnets. The small business will utilize a variety of bulk wave and guided wave scanning methods to identify the best solution for imaging the degradation in the magnets; this will include synthetic aperture focusing scans, phased array scans, and through-transmission guided wave scans. The research institution will conduct pre-/post-test visual imaging to characterize the mechanical degradation and compare this to the ultrasonic results. A prototype scanner will be developed based on the most successful technique(s). The proposing team has used a similar approach to successfully solve various non-destructive testing challenges in previous SBIR/STTR projects. The phenomenon of “training” has baffled superconducting magnet designers for over 50 years and is a costly and time-consuming procedure that every newly-constructed magnet must undergo prior to its intended use. Reduction of training is thus one of the key standing problems in the field. An ability to non- destructively localize and identify these mechanical flaws in magnets would provide a valuable insight for magnet designers and help them to better understand and mitigate training. Reducing superconducting magnet training could yield significant cost reductions for manufacturers. This benefit would not only be applicable to DOE applications in high- energy physics, such as fusion reactors and particle accelerators, but also to the many applications of superconducting magnets in the public sector. These applications include medical MRI machines, NMR equipment, mass spectrometers, magnetic separation processes, and superconducting maglev trains, among others."

This research and development will enable commercialization of a recently discovered geometric framework for constructing noise-robust quantum control pulses that offers several advantages over current approaches. To facilitate customization and adoption, our gate synthesis algorithms will be implemented in a modern, open-source machine learning software framework.

In this regime, many standard simulation approaches become impractical due to the sheer number of potential energy surfaces (PESs) that must be computed, while others are limited to very approximate levels of electronic structure theory. In this work, we address the critical need to develop efficient, general, and definitive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) tools suitable for modeling nonadiabatic dynamics spanning many electronic states. Here we use the word “definitive” to denote the fact that these methods will allow us to draw definitive conclusions about experimentally observed dynamics. This will be achieved not only through the development of highly accurate simulation methods, but also by developing strategies to unambiguously connect simulation with real experimental data. We are working to develop a hierarchy of AIMD approaches for modeling dynamics on many electronic states. Toward this end, we will address three key challenges: 1) We will develop efficient time-dependent electronic structure simulation approaches that achieve high accuracy by incorporating dynamic electron correlation. 2) We will accurately incorporate light into ab initio nonadiabatic dynamic simulations by careful reformulation of the Ehrenfest with Collapse To A Block (TAB) method that our group has previously developed to simulate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics on many electronic states. 3) We will close the gap between theoretically computable quantities and experimentally observable ones by develop tools to explicitly compute the signal of ultrafast x-ray absorption spectra from TAB-DMS simulations to enable the unambiguous assignment of these cutting-edge experiments.

These large (national laboratory scale) tools allow users to address some of the most important basic and applied research challenges. Even more powerful hard x-ray facilities are being designed. Many of these new facilities will rely on Wakefield accelerators to generate higher intensity / higher brightness beams. Of special importance is the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator program, which pursues the development of a variant known as electron beam-driven Structure Wakefield Accelerator (SWA). An array of accelerators based on this variant will play a central role in a free-electron laser-based x-ray user facility that is under consideration at Argonne National Laboratory. Electron beam-driven SWAs require high-precision cylindrical metallic waveguides, with internal corrugations engineered to perform as amplifying structures. Inability to procure commercial waveguides with the desired internal geometry is the major factor that has, so far, prevented the deployment of electron beam-driven SWAs. The goal of this program is to eliminate this barrier by developing a cost-effective process to fabricate high-precision cylindrical metallic waveguides with internal corrugations. The selected fabrication approach is based on the photo-chemical structuring of glass. This well-understood and very reproducible technique is used to produce sacrificial mandrels made out of fused silica. These exactingly-shaped pieces have on their external surface a pattern that corresponds to the desired internal shape (corrugation) of the SWA waveguide. A thick layer of copper is subsequently electro-deposited on the glass surface. Finally, the glass mandrel is etched away, leaving a free-standing hollowed metallic tube with precisely-shaped internal corrugations. During Phase I, the overall fabrication concept was validated. Metrology data confirmed that the desired accuracy can be achieved using the proposed approach. Several short demonstrators, based on an Argonne National Laboratory’s design, were produced. In Phase II, full size devices will be fabricated and provided to DOE end users."

Daniel A. Hammer (Principal Investigator) Daeyeon Lee (Co-Investigator) Matthew C. Good (Co-Investigator) An important area in the design of biomolecular materials is the recapitulation of cellular activities through the assembly of molecular components into functional synthetic cells, or protocells. By building cell-like structures that mimic the organization and size of natural cells but which incorporate novel, responsive components, we can augment their capabilities beyond biological limitations, including the ability to convert chemical and radiant (light) energies to mechanical energy. Recently, we developed new methods for making uniform capsules by microfluidic assembly by controlled dewetting which greatly enhances our control of protocell composition. We seek to develop motile protocells containing a wide range of enzymatic systems and use both surface and intra-protocell cascades to drive directed motion of protocells using gradients of substrates, heterogeneously applied stimuli, or asymmetric distributions of enzymes on the capsule surface. Because our methods are modular, we can explore a wide range of different enzymes in a single format, thus enabling us to make comparisons among different enzymes. We will also leverage our novel system for developing concentrated droplets of proteins to make motile and active coacervates, and to use these materials as membrane-less organelles which will serve as hubs for enzymatic activity that drive protocell motion from the inside out. Relevance to DOE mission. Our research on synthetic cells (protocells) fits squarely within the goals of the DOE BES Biomolecular Materials program. We will use biological cells as a blueprint for assembling functional protocells. A stated objective of the program is, “[the use of ""spatial and temporal control of assembly pathways and tunable management of assembly interfaces and defects,” which we can achieve with precision through targeted sequestration of enzymes to protocell and coacervate surfaces using light. The work we propose is a fundamental exploration of the design of protocells and coacervates as adaptive, motile matter, whose morphology, content, behavior and performance can be controlled through directed biochemical catalysis and the reconstitution and activation of enzymes, thus leading to the conversion of chemical to mechanical energy. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Motility of Single Uniform Protocells. We have developed innovative new methods for the rapid synthesis of uniform microcapsules in high number which will enable us to quantify the effects of enzymatic activity on capsule motion. We will induce motility by functionalizing protocells with a spectrum of enzymes, including gas generators (eg. catalase), cleavers (amylase), and converters (phosphatases and kinases), to ascertain the fundamental relationship between enzyme activity and capsule motion. To guide directional motility of these capsules, we will place protocells in microfluidic gradients of substrates. Aim 2. Motion and fluctuation of patchy interfaces. We will use the toolbox of molecular biology to spatially and temporally decorate the interface of capsules using light. We will measure the dynamic fluctuations of polymersome membranes caused by surface enzymatic activity. We will use micropipette aspiration to hold capsules during enzymatic activity to measure membrane force generation directly.

Using coacervating proteins as microcompartments in protocells, we will create regulatory hubs that guide protocell motion. Our toolkit allows controllable coacervate assembly, internal composition, interface patterning and demonstrates enzymatic conversion by chemical energy or light. We will expand our system to multiple discrete hubs and sequester multi-component cascades within protocells. Separately, we will embed active enzymes within or on coacervate surfaces to control their propulsion from the inside out.

Understanding and Controlling Nucleation in Atomic Layer Deposition for Materials Synthesis,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0004782,"Bent, Stacey",Stacey.Bent@boardoftrusteesofthelelandstanfordjunioruniversity,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Understanding and Controlling Nucleation in Atomic Layer Deposition for Materials Synthesis Stacey Bent, Stanford University Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has intensified in popularity as a versatile thin film deposition technique for a variety of applications, allowing for precise synthesis of materials for applications ranging from microelectronics to sustainable energy. ALD utilizes a series of successive, self-limiting gas-solid reactions of at least two compounds in a cyclic manner for the deposition of thin, uniform, and conformal films. Many of the applications for ALD—such as solar cells, batteries, catalysts, or microelectronics— require a high level of control over the film nucleation and growth processes to attain the desired materials properties. However, the morphology of the deposited material, while often critical for the application, can be difficult to precisely control. Thus, it is important to fully understand the mechanisms that take place in the ALD process because these mechanisms will govern the growth of the material. This research program aims to obtain mechanistic information about ALD materials synthesis. It uses fundamental insights from earlier research showing that both substrate pre-treatment and choice of ALD precursor can have a profound effect on the ease by which an ALD material nucleates and grows at a surface. It will use a strategy of employing homologous series of precursors combined with careful control over surface functionality to separate and identify the precursor and surface properties that most strongly influence ALD nucleation. The research in this program will focus on understanding nucleation mechanisms in two technologically important materials systems: metal ALD on low surface energy dielectric substrates, and metal oxide ALD on transition metal dichalcogenides. It will explore the use of precursor design, pre- and coadsorption of molecular species, and temperature to improve nucleation in ALD. The approach will apply in situ and ex situ characterization methods combined with theory and modeling. The research will leverage the specialized experimental apparatuses that the PI’s research group has built for performing both laboratory-based and synchrotron-based studies of the ALD process. New understanding will be used to develop deposition schemes in which better control over ALD nucleation can be achieved. The research will help build a framework of governing principles for nucleation in ALD, and the knowledge gained in the studies will also benefit other vapor-based materials synthesis. The research addresses challenges outlined in several DOE Basic Research Needs Reports. By enhancing the understanding of how to perform precise, scalable synthesis of materials with mechanistic control, the work will add to the scientific foundation of enabling generation of materials important to energy conversion systems, microelectronics, and other important technologies."

The related experimental platforms include Moiré superlattice systems, bilayer copper oxides, and other strongly correlated bilayers. Theoretically, there is limited understanding of what phases can be realized for microscopic models of strongly interacting systems due to non-perturbative nature of interactions. Based on extensive density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) numerical studies, we take on the challenge to map out quantum phase diagrams for different classes of multi-component strongly correlated systems. We aim to identify and reveal the interplay of topological superconducting states with other correlated states in the quantum phase diagrams and uncover the mechanism of the emergence of topological superconductivity in these systems. First, twisted Moiré superlattice systems are emerging as quantum simulators for Hubbard models with different superlattice geometries. We will systematically identify quantum phase diagrams for the relevant SU(4) Hubbard models based on the state-of-the-art DMRG studies. The research goal is to reveal the interplay between different phases and discover correlated states including spin liquids and unconventional superconductivity in these systems. Secondly, the PI proposes to systematically study the new routes for realizing topological superconductivity in Moiré systems through tuning band topology, time-reversal symmetry breaking, and SU(4) symmetry breaking perturbations. We will characterize the topological superconducting states through topological Chern number, entanglement spectrum, and excitation spectrum of Majorana fermions at the boundary and interface of a topological superconductor with vacuum or other correlated states. Thirdly, the PI proposes to explore the new physics of coupled cuprate and other correlated bilayers, with each layer in a superconducting state by doping a Mott insulator. We will explore the competition and interplay between different quantum phases, identify and characterize the emergent topological superconducting states to provide fundamental understanding and predictions for these systems. The topics to be addressed in this project are of fundamental importance for understanding a broad range of quantum phenomena emerging from correlated twisted material platforms. The proposed research aims at making breakthrough progress in understanding the strongly correlated multi-component systems and making discoveries of topological superconducting states in these systems. The extensive studies of realistic models for twisted Moiré and coupled cuprate-like systems will provide valuable information and prediction for experimental research. The PI and her team will develop new numerical approaches applicable to these strongly correlated systems to successfully carry out the proposed research."
"Empirical measurements and model representation of hydraulic
redistribution as a control on function of semiarid woody ecosystems
",Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023514,"Pockman, William",William.Pockman@universityofnewmexico,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Earth System Models (ESMs) allow us to simulate how ecosystems worldwide absorb and release carbon dioxide and how these processes respond to earth’s changing climate. The strength of these model projections depend on how well ESMs match the response of biomes (forests, grasslands, shrublands, etc) that each are different in their sensitivity to climate and their relative contributions to the global carbon cycle. Drylands cover more than 40% of the global terrestrial surface and are a major driver of both the long-term trend and the year-to-year variation in total carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, both the seasonality and magnitude of biogeochemical processes in drylands are challenging to represent in ESMs. Moreover, recent studies suggest that the inability of ESMs to simulate dryland ecosystem function is, in part, due to a failure to represent in the models the fluctuation of plant-available water dynamics and/or to simulate the response of ecosystem carbon exchange to plant-available water. Plant-mediated hydraulic redistribution (HR) is defined as the flow of water between soil compartments that differ in water content via plant roots connecting parts of the soil profile that differ in water content. Incorporating the role of HR offers a major opportunity for improving the representation of dryland soil moisture dynamics that is thought to limit the ability of ESMs to accurately describe carbon exchange in these ecosystems. The proposed research tests the idea that soil moisture dynamics and ecosystem function in dryland biomes cannot be well understood or modeled without a better representation of HR. To improve the representation of HR in ESMs, we will combine measurements of water flow through roots and the water content of different parts of the soil, with ecosystem-scale measurements of ecosystem carbon exchange, and the use of an approach called data assimilation to improve ability of the Terrestrial Ecosystem (TECO) model to address three objectives: Identify the key factors that determine whether or not HR occurs and the amount of water moved by HR when it occurs in species/biomes across a range of semi-arid western woodlands and forests. Quantify seasonal patterns of HR across dryland species and biomes to determine when HR has the biggest impact on soil moisture dynamics and the mechanisms driving these patterns. Use plant-level patterns in HR to estimate ecosystem-level NEE, GPP and Re in response to precipitation anomalies (periods of drought and unusually high water availability). To address these objectives, we will measure HR in dominant dryland species at existing sites instrumented to sensitive and continuous measurements of carbon exchange with the atmosphere in three key biomes (ponderosa pine forest, pinon-juniper woodland, and juniper savanna) that vary in elevation, climate, deep soil moisture availability and the presence of experimental manipulations. At each site, we will supplement existing instrumentation to add measurements of root sap flow, and soil water potential to measure the timing and magnitude of HR in each dominant species (Objective 1) and we will measure root sap flux patterns on a broader group of dominant and subdominant woody species to characterize the broader extent of HR regionally. Across sites, we will establish the differences in timing of HR and the conditions under which it is observed (Objective 2). Using newly-collected data and data from the flux towers (2009-present), we will employ data assimilation to improve model structures and parameterization in TECO to provide important advances in the ability of ESMs to capture HR and predict dryland ecosystem function. Finally, we will compare the tree-level measurements of HR with measurements of ecosystem function to correlate the HR patterns associated with variation in carbon exchange using empirical data for comparison with the TECO-HR model. TECO-HR will be used to test hypotheses about the role of HR in soil moisture dynamics under future climate change scenarios to identify tipping points when HR will either fail or be insufficient to sustain roots in drying surface soil."

However, the diamond ablator material used in this experiment displays detrimental effects due to the development of hydrodynamic instabilities at the diamond/fuel interface under shock compression. New alternatives to diamond ablators are required to step up the energy yield in ICF experiments and overcome the 1.9-megajoule ignition threshold. The unique combination of mechanical strength (approaching that of diamond), the ability to accommodate high-Z dopants (in contrast to diamond), and the tunability of the properties (through synthesis material with varying sp3 content) make amorphous carbon (a-C) a promising material for next-generation of ICF ablative capsules. However, despite its critical importance to the ICF program, the behavior of a-C carbon at extreme temperatures and pressures remains largely unexplored. The primary goals of this project are to perform groundbreaking dynamic compression experiments and predictive simulations to uncover the fundamental high-energy-density physics of amorphous carbon. Our hypothesis-driven scientific goals are (1) to uncover the metastability range of amorphous carbon and probe phase transitions to diamond or metastable supercooled liquid carbon; (2) to acquire high-quality equation of state (EOS) data and develop an experimentally validated EOS from machine-learning MD simulations of the complex states of carbon; and (3) to uncover the complex behavior of carbon liquid in both thermodynamically stable and metastable supercooled states by accessing large areas of carbon phase diagram with amorphous samples with variable sp3 content. Our proposed experimental program includes equation of state and diffraction measurements using the Omega EP laser at the Laboratory of Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester and an investigation the structure and bonding of a-C under isothermal compression at the HPCAT sector of Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. The theoretical/simulation program involves the development of machine-learning models of the complex response of amorphous carbon under dynamic compression by performing molecular dynamics simulations at experimental time and length scales using leadership class DOE supercomputers. Simulations will guide experiments to observe predicted phenomena and acquire critical experimental data in specific pressure-temperature domains to validate theoretical models. The research will deliver fundamental properties of novel amorphous carbon ICF ablator material, including phase diagram and EOS. These results will aid in ICF target design and ICF implosion experiments. A unique combination of predictive simulations and dynamic and static experiments will provide a highly inspirational intellectual environment for nurturing the graduate students and postdocs involved in this project."
Transforming Critical Materials Separations through Metal-Oxo Cluster Chemistry,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023477,"Knope, Karah",Karah.Knope@georgetownuniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Platinum group elements (PGE) plus gold and rare earth elements (REE) are critical for advanced energy, information and communications technologies including wind energy, hybrid vehicles, solid-state lighting, and any electronic device or component that enables these technologies. These elements are relatively scarce, they are mined in geopolitically sensitive regions, and no materials have yet been identified to replace them. Therefore, recycling and extracting critical metals from lower grade sources becomes urgent for society to sustain current lifestyles, while also targeting net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. To reduce hazardous materials and energy use, innovations in separation chemistries and technologies are imperative. Towards this end, the goal of this work is to create broadly applicable design rules for metal-oxo cluster-based separations that can be translated to separation of any chemically similar metal cations. Recent investigations of the empirically designed industrial separation of the two most similar elements on the periodic table (Zr/HfIV) revealed that smaller Hf oxoclusters are separated from larger Zr oxoclusters via solvent extraction, and their aqueous-phase differentiation is rooted in fundamental chemical behavior. This knowledge suggests that other separations can likewise be designed to exploit and reap the benefits of metal oxocluster based separations. Towards this end, two critical separation scenarios including separation of any two or more REE3+ and separation of Pd/Pt2+ and Au3+ will be interrogated using advanced in-house characterization techniques such as multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), small-angle and X-ray total scattering-pair distribution function (SAXS, PDF), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), single-crystal X-ray diffraction, UV-vis, vibrational and luminescence spectroscopies. These efforts together with studies at user facilities exploiting X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and anomalous-SAXS as well as the development of new computational tools aim to (1) design simple aqueous heterometal oxocluster systems that enhance differences between similar metal cations via diverging speciation; (2) design aqueous-organic systems that differentiate via extraction of topologically distinct metal oxoclusters; and (3) exploit crystallization behavior of topologically distinct metal oxoclusters for separation of similar metal cations. Such knowledge holds the potential to transform current separations, with benefits of a cluster based approach including better atom economy (extraction of multiple metals with fewer, smaller and simpler ligands), magnification of small differences in metal-cation chemistries via self-sorting into topologically distinct oxoclusters to improve separations, and crystallization or efficient extraction (with fewer repeat steps) to minimize waste. Broader scientific impacts of this work, if successful, include 1) Scientific basis for designing efficient metal-metal separations, 2) New computational tools for automated interpretation of complex mass spectra of inorganic molecules, and 3) Enhanced understanding of how to synthesize targeted heterometal oxides from water."

Mixed-phase clouds composed of a mixture of cloud droplets and ice crystals are prevalent at high latitudes, and have been suggested to play an important role in the surface energy budgets, thereby affecting the surface temperature in these regions. While they are important in the climate system, the understanding of mixed-phase clouds at high latitudes is still very limited, owing to complex interactions among the synoptic scale atmospheric state, cloud-top radiative cooling, cloud dynamics and microphysics, boundary layer turbulence, and land/ocean/ice surface properties. In this proposal, we aim to address the following science questions: (1) Can GCMs simulate reasonably well the mixed-phase cloud properties as well as their differences between northern and southern high latitudes? (2) If not, how do the representations of ice microphysical processes (e.g., ice nucleation, Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) process) and aerosol processes (e.g., convective transport and scavenging) in GCMs affect the simulations of aerosol and mixed-phase cloud properties, through coupling with dynamics and radiation? and (3) What role do seasonally varying aerosols play in the different mixed-phase cloud properties between northern and southern high latitudes? To tackle these science questions, we will test several new treatments/parameterizations developed from the process understanding of mixed-phase clouds, utilizing an integrated modeling approach. This includes running the CAM6 in the weather forecast mode through the DOE Cloud-Associated Parameterizations Testbed (CAPT) and in the single-column mode, to facilitate the comparisons with field campaign data. The new treatments/parameterizations to be tested include: (1) new ice nucleation parameterizations of marine organic aerosols acting as INPs; (2) inclusion of subgrid cloud treatments such as heterogeneous mixing between cloud liquid and ice (pocket structures) in mixed-phase clouds, which can have a critical impact on the WBF process in mixed-phase clouds for the conversion of cloud liquid to cloud ice; (3) a unified treatment of aerosol vertical transport and wet scavenging in convective clouds; and (4) a new higher-order turbulence closure scheme, which unifies the treatments of boundary-layer turbulence, shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics in CAM6. We will run the CAPT simulations for multiple years to compare with the long-term ARM data at the Arctic sites (North Slope of Alaska Utqiagvik and Oliktok Point), and with the observation data obtained from the ARM West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) in 2016 and the Measurements of Aerosols, Radiation, and Clouds over the Southern Ocean (MARCUS) from September 2017 to April 2018. Modeled probability density functions (PDFs) of cloud occurrence, LWP, IWP, and phase partitioning will be compared between the northern and southern high latitudes and also with observations. Seasonal variabilities of aerosol and mixed-phase cloud properties will be analyzed. New model treatments/parameterizations will also be tested in the free-run mode to examine their performance when large-scale feedbacks and land/ocean/ice changes are included. The observation data used in model evaluations include multi-sensor mixed-phase cloud retrievals from the ARM NSA sites and from the AWARE and MARCUS campaigns. With the multi-sensor measurements at these sites, stratiform mixed-phase cloud properties, including droplet effective radius, droplet concentration and liquid water path for the liquid phase, and ice concentration, ice effective radius and ice water path for the ice phase will be retrieved. MPL, HSRL, and Doppler lidar measurements will be used to develop a dataset of aerosol vertical distributions for aerosol extinctions and aerosol types, especially over the NSA sites."

These semiconductor NCs have been integrated with metal particles, molecular catalysts, or enzymes to form semiconductor-catalyst nano-heterostructures that have demonstrated promising performance. Despite this progress, effective coupling of photon absorption in the semiconductor NCs with catalytic transformation at the catalytic site remains poorly understood and requires detailed mechanistic understanding of long-distance charge separation and recombination in these heterostructures. The proposed research program is focused on detailed mechanistic understanding of three types of nano-heterostructures: semiconductor NC/molecular catalyst complexes for light-driven H2 generation and CO2 reduction, semiconductor NC/metal catalyst heterostructures for light-driven H2 generation, and plasmonic semiconductor p-n junctions for plasmon-induced hot electron transfer and photocatalysis. These nano-heterostructures are ideal model systems for particle-based solar-fuel generation systems because their elementary charge transfer and catalytic reaction processes can be carefully examined by in operando time-resolved spectroscopic tools. Furthermore, these mechanistic insights are also helpful for understanding catalyst-modified bulk semiconductor electrodes used in photoelectrochemical cells. Prof. Tianquan Lian and his research team will advance the understanding of these NC/catalyst heterostructures through a research program with three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 is focused on understanding multiple-electron transfer from semiconductor NCs to molecular catalysts. The proposed work will first examine excited state Fano resonance, a general and poorly understood phenomenon resulting from the coupling of molecular vibrations with the intraband absorption of semiconductors. Multiple charge separation and recombination processes in NC/molecular catalyst complexes will then be investigated by transient IR spectroscopy, focusing on the transformation of the molecular catalyst. This work will lead to important design principles for developing NC/molecular catalyst complexes for efficient light driven H2 generation and CO2 reduction.

FPoliSolutions will leverage an existing in-house enterprise digital Asset Data Analytics platform, (ADALIX), which is currently limited to Operating Deflection Shape (ODS) analyses. ADALIX was originally designed to fit a gap in the condition monitoring market. It combines high enterprise scalability with high resolution, physics-based system engineering which is typically only available in small scale single-purpose condition monitoring products. The existing application also leverages INL’s RAVEN tool to handle simulation frameworks and machine learning. In this project the application will be extended to consider other sensor data, well beyond ODS, to provide digital-twin technology that enhances failure predicting capabilities. As an enterprise solution, it will provide a highly collaborative environment within the organization to view, edit, monitor, analyze assets data near-real time and intelligently prioritize maintenance activities. Interpretability, traceability, and overall transparency of the methodology are essential in the nuclear industry (operations specialists, site managers, maintenance engineers and regulators alike). Such quality attributes will require careful consideration in the evolution of the architecture. Key quality attributes of the proposed solution include ease-of-use, scalability (thousands of assets, multiple systems/enterprises), cross-platform compatibility, and user/customer-specific deployment models that meet individual cybersecurity and IT requirements. Effective application program interfaces (APIs) will minimize acquisition costs and provide the ability to manage assets or problems that can be use-case specific. The system will be able to process cascading effects by ‘triaging’ different types of signals and disparate information sets. FPoli has an open dialogue with utilities in this area. In Phase-I of this project, FPoli intends to continue gathering and clarify industry use cases. This step is necessary to optimize the architecture of the product and ensure a strong market fit to the final product. Considering the existing framework, FPoli can achieve an initial minimum viable product (MVP) by the completion of Phase-I during which implementation techniques and approaches will be prototyped and tested. Phase-I work will provide detailed requirements to be considered for Phase-II. The final product will be completed in Phase-II. This will require upgrades and optimization at scale to address specific maintenance problems and programming of new methods into the backend of the platform to solve those problems."

For example, DARPA has just awarded $90 million, to create a 6' x 6' x 6' box that, upon deployment, makes 1000 doses of >1000 nucleotide constructs in three days."
Machine Learning and Data Science to Advance Laboratory Earthquake Prediction and Illuminate the Mechanics of Precursors to Failure,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020512,"Marone, Chris",Chris.Marone@thepennsylvaniastateuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Earthquakes represent one of our greatest natural hazards and in recent years human induced seismicity is adding to the threat. Even a modest improvement in the ability to forecast devastating large earthquakes or smaller shallow events associated with fluid injection could save thousands of lives and billions of dollars. Current efforts to forecast earthquakes are limited by knowledge of earthquake physics and hampered by a lack of reliable lab or field observations. However, recent work in our lab and elsewhere provides a critical opportunity for advancement. We have found: 1) clear and consistent precursors prior to earthquake-like failure in the laboratory and 2) that lab earthquakes can be predicted using machine learning (ML). These works show that stick-slip failure events –the lab equivalent of earthquakes– are preceded by a cascade of micro-failure events that radiate elastic energy in a manner that foretells catastrophic failure. Remarkably, ML predicts the fault zone stress state, the failure time and in some cases the magnitude of lab earthquakes. In addition, the observations include clear precursors to failure in the form of changes in fault zone properties prior to lab earthquakes. Precursors have been observed in previous laboratory studies but their origin is poorly understood and their possible connection to ML based earthquake prediction is unknown. Here, we propose to dramatically expand these efforts and develop an integrated data science approach to illuminate the physics of earthquake precursors and lab earthquake prediction. The proposed work will accelerate the development of ML, artificial intelligence (AI), and related data science approaches by providing massive data sets that are tightly connected to critical scientific problems and by bringing together leading subject matter experts and data scientists. Earthquake physics involves phenomena that are far from equilibrium. The proposed work will leverage data science methods to illuminate these phenomena and investigate how they relate to earthquake prediction. In addition to a large database with many types of labeled events that will be openly distributed, the proposed work will advance our fundamental understanding of seismic forecasting, earthquake physics, and fault rheology."

Bieler, Michigan State University (Co-Principal Investigator) Philip Eisenlohr, Michigan State University (Co-Principal Investigator) Pashupati Dhakal, Jefferson Lab (Co-Principal Investigator) Eric Taleff, The University of Texas at Austin (Co-Principal Investigator) Particle accelerator technology is becoming widely available to industry and science, providing capabilities in the fields of medicine, national security, and scientific discoveries. Energy efficient, high-performance (also known as high Q) SRF Nb cavities have been developed that can be used for accelerating charged particles such as electrons to very high velocities in shorter distances. Consistent breakthroughs have been possible with SRF Nb cavities due to a better understanding of metallurgical aspects of pure Nb leading to the preparation of high-quality SRF Nb surfaces. To further enhance efficiency and achieve 100% duty factor in compact accelerators, it is vital to understand the development of Nb properties starting from the initial raw material through to the final cavity. Advances that enable more cost-effective and higher performance SRF cavities, align with P5 recommendations and also serve other current and future SRF applications such as Energy Recovery Linacs (ERLs), X-ray light sources, Free Electron Lasers (FELs), electron-ion colliders, and electron coolers. CW operation of large-scale SRF installations benefits greatly from high quality factors, Q0. Also, reliable, energy-efficient, high-Q0 systems could enter medical and environmental (flue gas, water treatment) applications, quantum computing, and sensing. This program investigates the metallurgical limitations to high quality factors (Q0) and accelerating fields in SRF Nb cavities, and explores mitigation strategies by developing new and optimized upstream and downstream processing methods with a focus on the control of the Nb microstructure and surface. The original effort was a collaboration between a separately funded microstructure and modeling program headed by Michigan State University and this original collaboration between Florida State University and Jefferson lab that more closely examined the property–microstructure–microchemistry relationship, but in 2019 the two programs were brought together under one award. A key to this effort is the sustained partnership with the SRF R&D group at Jefferson Lab, which brings both the cavity processing and testing expertise and, importantly, the ability to obtain sample coupons that have been processed to cavity-quality. The expected impact of these coupon studies is to provide routes to a better understanding of the basic physical metallurgy of SRF-quality Nb, leading to higher and reproducible Q0 at high accelerating fields, reducing operational (cryogenic) and construction (high energy) costs of future accelerators. This allows us to directly feed ideas back into the production of SRF cavities; for instance, we were (i) able to directly show how microstructure impacted loss-inducing flux-trapping and (ii) from our microstructural analysis suggested that the use of cold-worked microstructure sheet for cavity fabrication could reduce the temperatures at which cavities have to be baked to reduce flux-trapping to acceptable levels. These ideas were tested at JLab and shown to be effective. With the introduction of expertise at the University of Texas-Austin in dynamic grain growth we hope to make a breakthrough in the microstructural control of SRF cavities. Our approach of combining detailed microstructural characterization and modeling with comprehensive superconducting property evaluations of the same samples, while collaborating with experts in cavity fabrication is the key to understanding the sources of SRF performance limitations."

Reichenbacher, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (Co-Investigator) J. Wang, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (Co-Investigator) Abstract: Underground physics experiments promise the possibilities of solving two of the most interesting and challenging mysteries of the universe: the behavior of the neutrinos, which are the second most common particles in the universe, and the nature of the dark matter that makes up 80% of the universe by mass. Despite its prevalence and importance to the history of the universe, little is known about this dark matter other than it interacts via gravity and consists of elementary particles different from that which makes up stars, planets, and everything else we can observe directly with light. The group at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology will make strong contributions to current and future neutrino and dark matter experiments, taking advantage of its proximity to the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). The group will lead work on calibrations, analysis, and understanding and reducing radioactive backgrounds. The work will support three neutrino projects on the Intensity Frontier: the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), MicroBooNE, and ANNIE. The group will lead work building systems to calibrate DUNE’s low-energy response and photon-detection system. They will perform simulations and analysis at MicroBooNE and ANNIE. The group will lead DUNE background measurements and simulation studies, including exploring the potential of a DUNE low-background cryostat for precision measurements of solar neutrinos, and searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay and dark matter. It will help ensure the accuracy of measurements of fundamental and potentially new non-standard neutrino parameters, potentially helping explain why the universe is full of matter and not antimatter. On the Cosmic Frontier, the group will play large roles in on-site commissioning, operations, calibrations, and analysis of the LZ and SuperCDMS SNOLAB projects. These largely complementary dark matter experiments together will greatly improve our sensitivity to a broad range of dark matter candidates. Improved low-energy neutron calibrations and analysis, and the study of LZ’s time stability for signals and backgrounds, will improve the sensitivity of LZ to search for potential low-mass dark matter particles in conjunction with SuperCDMS. The group’s research to lower, understand, and identify backgrounds due to radon daughters will help both LZ and SuperCDMS, as well as future experiments."

These devices, which will play a central role in a renewable energy future for the United States, are powered by electrocatalysts composed of precious metals and oxides. The development of such electrocatalysts has long been driven by Edisonian trial-and-error discovery, but more recently, approaches based on first principles computational predictions of promising materials for the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions have also emerged. These predictions have been successful in identifying improved electrocatalysts with relatively simple catalyst structures and reaction chemistries, but a new generation of catalytic materials, including alloys with many elemental components and catalysts that include both metal and oxide moieties, cannot be easily described by such methods. The structure of such catalysts may evolve dynamically in realistic electrochemical environments, and these changes have crucial consequences for both the stability of the catalytic materials and the associated reaction mechanisms and rates. To overcome these challenges, and to thereby accelerate the identification of the next generation of electrocatalysts, this work will exploit state-of-the-art data science methods, first principles predictions of properties of catalyst surfaces, and experimental probes of the molecular and electronic structure of these surfaces. These techniques will be deployed to study ORR and OER on high entropy alloys, a novel class of materials that combines up to five distinct elements in almost limitless compositions and structures. Such alloys have great promise as ORR and OER catalysts, but the vast number of possible materials can only be analyzed and exploited through novel, data science-accelerated strategies such as those describe above. The data science algorithms will refine predictive models from the first principles calculations against databases of computational and experimental data for the high entropy alloys. The combined data science, first principles, and experimental strategies that will be developed and deployed will, in turn, permit rapid identification of alloys that have high chemical reactivity for the desired energy conversion reactions, robust durability under harsh electrochemical conditions, and facile synthesis for desired applications."

Planned projects extend from theoretical method development and computational implementation to applications to molecular spectroscopy and thermochemistry. In the latter area, we plan to extend our DOE-supported development of protocols for high-accuracy thermochemical calculations – which is part of the broader ATcT (Active Thermochemical Tables) effort of Ruscic – to explore the limits of just how accurately one can calculate a bond energy or a heat of formation. This work exploits continued growth in available computational resources, as well as recent software developments by my group and collaborators, as are included in the cfour package. In addition, our work in computational spectroscopy will continue on two frontiers. First, our longstanding interest in vibronic coupling and development of methods in this area will continue. It is planned to explore the degree to which very high level adjustments for electron correlation affect the parameters in Jahn-Teller and Pseudo-Jahn-Teller Hamiltonians, and to carry out applications to the A-X band system of NO3, which was first recorded about fifteen years ago but remains poorly understood. In addition, we plan to extend our studies of vibronic interactions into a new area – core-excitation spectroscopy – where less is known about the systematics of vibronic effects. Finally, we will extend our recent and DOE-supported work on fourth-order vibrational perturbation theory to develop methods to calculate parameters relevant to high-resolution spectroscopy. These include the vibrational dependence of usual (quartic) centrifugal distortion constants, and the quadratic dependence of the rotational constants on vibratonal quantum number. Amongst other things, these developments will facilitate the detection of molecules at very high J in the terahertz region, and will aid in the determination of equilibrium structures. Additional topics targeted for investigation are a modification of the popular VPT2 model for rovibrational states that helps to overcome issues caused by large amplitude motion (very low frequency modes), and a quantum-chemical approach to photodissociation based on the Condon reflection principle, as parametrized by equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory. All of these methods will be incorporated into the cfour quantum chemistry program package, which is freely available to the scientific community."

At Louisiana State University we have built a program around these topics that emphasizes both fundamental theoretical research and a close connection with experimental groups doing attosecond physics. Our main topic is strong field attosecond transient absorption (ATA), which is the transient absorption of ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation by systems interacting with a precisely synchronized near-to-mid infrared (IR) laser pulse. By spectrally resolving the light transmitted through or reflected from a sample as a function of delay between the dressing laser pulse and the broadband attosecond EUV probe, transient absorption spectroscopy can provide high spectral resolution and high (attosecond) time resolution simultaneously. We will study ATA using a versatile theoretical treatment that takes account of both the strong laser-atom interaction at the single system level, by numerically solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE), as well as propagation of the radiation in the non-linear medium, by solving the Maxwell wave equation (MWE) using the TDSE-calculated time-dependent polarization in the medium as a source term. Our goal is to build up a time-dependent picture of absorption at EUV and soft X-ray wavelengths, and to use our theoretical tools to extract information on strong field dynamics from both full calculations and experiments. The problems we will study fall broadly into three categories: (i) A central theme in this proposal is spatiotemporal control of XUV light. We will study how XUV and X-ray pulses are reshaped in time and space via their interaction with different types of matter in the presence of a strong, synchronized IR pulse. We will investigate two effects; opto-optical modulation of resonant radiation and high-order wave-mixing processes. Both topics have their genesis in ongoing collaborations with experimental groups, but we will apply the concepts of spatiotemporal control broadly across several topics. (ii) Studies with ultrafast free-electron-laser (FEL) light. In two newly initiated experiment/theory collaborations we will: (a) study ATA for core-excited states using intense sub-to-few fs X-ray FEL pulses, with intensities such that both linear and non-linear X-ray processes take place, (b) study both the characterization and the use of coherent harmonic radiation from a seeded FEL. There is strong overlap with our studies on non-linear Stark phases in atomic systems. (iii) ATA in condensed matter systems. We will apply a theoretical approach based on the semi- conductor Bloch equation to the study of ATA in condensed phase systems. Topics include expanding upon our present work on exitonic ATA, and exploring the possibility of spatially separating the macroscopic ATA response from different k-points in the Brillouin zone."

A central challenge in this field is maintaining full control at the single-particle level while increasing the system complexity. This proposal aims to study the coherent quantum behavior and dynamics of strongly interacting spin systems in the solid state. The central experimental tool is a technique that we have recently developed, which allows the spins of single Erbium (Er3+) ion impurities in a crystal host to be optically initialized and measured through a nanophotonic cavity. Importantly, the addressing of individual ions is achieved in the frequency domain, instead of spatially, allowing for control of individual spins with sub-10 nm separation, and therefore strong interactions. The strength of this approach is highlighted by our recent demonstration of high fidelity (95%), single-shot readout of a single spin within a dense ensemble. Using this platform, we plan to carry out fundamental investigations of strongly interacting spin systems in solids, studying the interplay of different interaction mechanisms and developing spectroscopy techniques to identify the governing Hamiltonian in a particular instance of the system with randomly positioned spins. Furthermore, we will develop quantum control techniques to generate arbitrary effective Hamiltonians. This will allow many-body quantum states to be protected from noise and unwanted interactions, and is important to explore the potential of strongly interacting spin systems for quantum information processing and quantum-enhanced metrology.

Cooperative activation and reaction of CO2 with specific substrates in the presence of a well-designed catalyst is thus of great importance to achieve an energy- and atom-efficient chemical transformation. This proposed research is to develop fundamental understanding of catalytic coupling between CO2 and ethylene, based on which we design efficient heterogenous catalysts for producing acrylic acid and its derivatives, which are high-value, high-volume building blocks in chemical industry. In this research, we will apply computational modeling to explore the mechanisms of this reaction over different catalysts that are based on functionalized two-dimensional materials and zeolites. By engineering the active sites and the local reaction environment, we plan to enhance activation of CO2 and drive the C-C coupling selectively.

The Department of Energy (DOE) plays a significant role in this effort by ensuring that the energy sector is secure and prospering through transformative science and technology solutions that lead to more efficient, renewable and environmentally benign energy resources. Addressing these challenges requires that the country recruit the very best and brightest into our science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) workforce. The net must be spread broadly to capture the diversity of people and ideas that are required for innovative solutions. Currently the net is not capturing a large swath of this talent pool when it comes to gender and race; the highest levels of the Department of Energy have recognized this as an issue that needs immediate attention. In recognition of the need for a more diverse workforce in its DOE funded research programs, in 2000 the Basic Energy Sciences (BES) office of DOE began funding a unique new research based program called “COACh” (Committee on the Advancement of Women Chemists) that has been on the leading edge of developing programs to increase the number and success of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields with data-driven programs that have been carefully tailored for different disciplines and career levels. Since this initial funding from BES, COACh has grown into an internationally recognized organization that has had a positive impact on the careers of over 20,000 scientists and engineers in fields that include chemistry, physics, engineering, math, computer science, materials science, geology and biology. Integral to COACh and exclusively funded by DOE has been COACh’s research effort that guides all aspects of its priorities and planning.

To accomplish this, we formulate and implement new approaches to both RPA calculations and machine-learning AIMD acceleration in the open-source SPARC-X massively parallel electronic structure code. SPARC-X exploits a recent breakthrough in electronic structure methodologies: systematically improvable, strictly local, orthonormal, discontinuous real-space bases that efficiently and systematically capture the local chemistry of the system. With the development of a new density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) based formulation for the correlation energy in the random phase approximation, the algorithmic complexity and prefactor associated with such many-body calculations will be dramatically reduced. Using petascale computational resources, SPARC-X will enable quantum mechanical simulations at the RPA level of theory for length and time scales previously accessible only by local/semilocal exchange-correlation functionals, e.g., 1000 atoms for a few picoseconds. Using future exascale resources, the sizes and times targeted are one to two orders of magnitude larger. SPARC-X will be augmented with the capability to perform on-the-fly machine-learned force field (MLFF) simulations with ?-machine learning, where recent breakthroughs in fingerprinting schemes and Gaussian process regression (GPR) approaches will push the boundaries of chemical complexity and system size that can be studied using such methods, enabling time scales that are a further two orders of magnitude larger. These capabilities have applications in a wide variety of chemical sciences, especially reactive interfaces where systems typically include many elemental species with various types of chemical bonding and large length- and/or long time-scales are needed. These factors create challenges for both traditional force fields and existing machine-learned force fields. Overcoming these challenges is particularly important for catalysis at oxide interfaces, which require methods that are simultaneously capable of treating the complex solid-state electronic structure of the oxide, the covalent bonding in adsorbed molecules, and the dynamic van der Waals and hydrogen bonding of solvents and weakly adsorbed species. This project will develop, test, and apply the SPARC-X framework to establish new benchmarks for the problem of water dissociation at TiO2 surfaces, and provide new insight into the adsorption energies of intermediates in the process of carbon-assisted photocatalytic nitrogen fixation on TiO2. This integrated development and application strategy will ensure that SPARC-X is a robust, efficient, and scalable software package for quantum simulations on current petascale and future exascale computing resources, providing unprecedented capabilities for chemical and materials research around the world."
"Uncovering the microbial networks that degrade plant-derived phenolic compounds and
their role in peatland soil carbon sequestration revisiting the 'enzyme latch' hypothesis",Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023297,"Kostka, Joel",Joel.Kostka@georgiatechresearchcorporation,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","While peatlands are freshwater wetlands that make up just 3 percent of the Earth’s landmass, they store about one-third of the planet’s soil carbon as thick peat deposits. Most peatlands are found in cooler wetter regions where the microbial breakdown of organic matter is relatively slow. As global temperatures rise, microbes could break into the peatland carbon bank and the resulting decomposition of the ancient, combustible plant biomass would lead to increased levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane) being released into the atmosphere, accelerating climate change. Our overall goal is to uncover the mechanisms or biochemical pathways by which microbes, plants, and the environment interact to control the various steps in the microbial degradation of soil organic matter in peatlands. In particular, previous work by our team and others indicates that phenolic compounds, produced during the breakdown of lignocellulose found in the cell walls of certain plants, may slow down microbial metabolism of soil organic matter. Understanding the mechanisms and controls of the microbial breakdown of organic matter with respect to the overlying vegetation will allow us to improve predictions of how the peatland soil carbon bank will be affected by climate change. Hypotheses driving the proposed research are: 1) When peat soils are flooded with water, phenolic compounds derived from certain plants act as “bottlenecks” to microbial soil organic matter decomposition by binding and preventing enzymatic attack of organic matter polymers; thus the degradation of these polymers is the rate limiting step in peatland soil organic matter decomposition (referred to as ‘enzyme latch’ mechanism). 2) Since the enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of phenolic compounds are dependent upon oxygen, soil moisture content and oxygen availability largely determine which microbes and biochemical pathways are operative in the degradation of lignocellulose and lignin, thereby regulating soil organic matter storage (the opposite of decomposition) through the ‘enzyme latch’. 3) Climate change, which is expected to warm and dry out peatlands, will release the ‘enzyme latch’ and cause microbes to break into the carbon bank by stimulating the enzymatic decomposition of phenolic compounds and organic polymers. 4) Conversely, changes in plant communities caused by climate change, the replacement of mosses by lignin-rich vascular plants (shrubs), will act to strengthen the ‘enzyme latch’, by preventing microbial decomposition through the accumulation of plant-derived phenolic compounds. Specific research objectives will be to: Task I. Test the ‘enzyme latch’ hypothesis (prevention of soil organic matter decomposition by the accumulation of plant-derived phenolic compounds) in the field. Task II. Test the ‘enzyme latch’ hypothesis and its response to environmental conditions linked to climate change (temperature, redox, water content) under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Task III. Determine the response of the ‘enzyme latch’ to the manipulation of climate conditions (temperature, elevated carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere) at the whole ecosystem scale. Task IV. Use field and laboratory investigations to improve predictions of future carbon storage and develop quantitative indicators of the microbe-plant-environment interactions that control soil organic matter degradation in peatlands exposed to climate change. Task V. Create a curated, comprehensive, and searchable genome and gene database that documents the microbial populations and processes mediating lignocellulose and lignin degradation in soils on a global scale, along with underlying physico-chemical data, geocoded via GIS to reveal geographic distribution patterns of the populations. Our approach leverages the resources and expertise of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Joint Genome Institute along with the extensive infrastructure and site characterization datasets of DOE’s Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE), located within the Marcell Experimental Forest (MN, USA). At this site, experiments are performed at the ecosystem scale using an experimental design that allows for statistical testing of how environmental conditions impacted by climate change (temperature, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, changes to plant communities) alter the flow of organic matter in peatlands."

Even with significant advances in subsurface technology, including imaging, over the past few decades, fundamental scientific knowledge gaps still exist in our ability to image and fully characterize physical/chemical changes that occur from natural and anthropogenic activities in subsurface formations. These knowledge gaps impact effectiveness, performance, safety and environmental stewardship which is critical for CO_2 sequestration, hydrogen storage, geothermal systems and subsurface waste disposal. The subsurface dynamics, with associated hazards such as natural and induced seismicity, are modeled by a multiscale multiphysics system which is only partly understood. The goal is to characterize this system and enable forecasting. A multitude of available but complex data provide an opportunity to make significant progress in filling the aforementioned knowledge gaps. The key scientific objective of this project is to develop a machine-learning based framework for analyzing, monitoring and forecasting the evolution of multiscale multiphysics processes associated with active fault systems, fracture networks, geomechanics, flow and porous medium reservoirs. Machine learning methods can reveal unforeseen and intriguing patterns in data signals and distinguish, for example, different “noises”. To connect these patterns to subsurface processes largely remains a challenge. Possible processes range from friction and slip to pore pressure diffusion and fluid migration. The proposed methodologies encompass the construction and study of different principled architectures in deep learning (unsupervised, self-supervised and supervised) that are rooted in (geo)physics, with particular properties for the abovementioned tasks. For data analysis and forecasting, the approaches include deep consensus, topological deep learning, recurrent factorial variational autoencoders and source separation, among others. To identify systems, the approaches pertain to causal inference, operator learning, conditional injective flows and deep active learning, among others. The two will be intertwined and fully integrated. Topology appears naturally in fracture networks and connectivity relevant to fluid migration and paths of failure. Cooperative failure dynamics has been recently described by fiber bundle models. This motivates learning nontrivial topology of manifolds and even nontrivial fiber bundles requiring novel deep neural network designs. This is inspired by well-established topological data analysis, the use of which in geosciences is still underutilized. Furthermore, the development of topological deep learning is natural in the context of capturing topological dynamics in generative models. The research program will develop the foundation for machine learning-based approaches and, by combining information from multimodal data sets, provide transformative advances in the representation and determination of complex processes that occur in the subsurface. The project will provide greater understanding and development of machine learning approaches to describe heterogeneous, time-dependent geologic systems that may revolutionize our ability to understand and forecast the subsurface to benefit the economy, the environment, and safety of people."

The approach involves the synthesis of innovative non-fluorinated polymers within unique housing that do not evolve HF and offer low air and water permeability with extreme radiation durability. In Phase II, advanced polymer graded-z nanocomposites based on BN and Au were developed and exposed to harsh irradiation alongside candidate commercial seal materials for a durability study to reach a Technology Readiness Level 5. Mechanical, thermal, and thermomechanical testing were conducted prior to and post irradiation on a representative rotating shaft. Hardness values are being tailored to address that of the base rotating shaft within the beam dump. Materials have been down-selected and irradiated again to elucidate the mechanism for the radiation durability observed in the current Phase II study recently presented to the nuclear physics community. A down-selected set of polymers shall be irradiated under harsh radiation up to 600 kGy, and then under conditions representative of the rare isotope beam facility in the Linac Isotope Producer, up to 2 MGy. New noble metal nanoparticle coated ferrofluidic seals shall also be explored to address breakdown previously observed in organic paraffin-based carrier fluids. Seal prototypes shall be formed and integrated within a commercial parters’ housing design. Technology Readiness Level 7 shall be reached via experiments in a representative rare isotope high radiation environment. Radiation durable rotary vacuum and water seals shall be manufactured for use with rare isotope beam facilities for the stable production of new and rare isotopes. These isotopes shall benefit advanced imaging needs within the medical community. Many dual-use applications are being explored for space, military, and nuclear energy markets."

In such collisions a small droplet of QGP is created when two heavy nuclei collide at nearly the speed of light. In the wake of such collisions, a short-lived (lifetime < 10-22 s) state with energy density well exceeding 1 GeV/fm3 is created which maps to temperatures on the order of 4-7 trillion Kelvin. Such temperatures are sufficient to deconfine the quarks and gluons into the primordial soup called the QGP. Surprisingly, experimental indications are that the QGP exhibits properties of a near-equilibrium thermal system at the end of its lifetime. Understanding how a far-from-equilibrium QGP can approach local thermal equilibrium on such short time scales requires investigations using quantum chromodynamics and dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics. In this work, the PI extends the recently developed framework of anisotropic hydrodynamics and applications thereof. This will help to provide a better picture of the non-equilibrium dynamics occurring in both heavy-ion collisions (AA) and collisions involving ""small systems"", e.g. proton-nucleus (pA) and proton-proton (pp) collisions. The work on anisotropic hydrodynamics is also coupled with complementary work on effective kinetic theory applied to QCD and bottomonium suppression in an open quantum system."

In North America there is a 1.5 GW market that obtains electricity from diesel generation at $0.30 to $1.30/kWh, with substantial noise, environmental, and emissions issues. Ocean Renewable Power Company, Inc. (ORPC) seeks to develop scalable applications of marine renewable energy (MRE) as a baseload power source for 100 percent renewable microgrid operations. ORPC will work with the City of False Pass, Alaska, to plan the deployment of a microgrid system using ORPC power systems as baseload generation. False Pass is situated near a premier tidal energy resource that offers a potential to considerably reduce the use of diesel fuel and provide locally sourced energy. For the Phase I effort ORPC (1) demonstrated the economic and technical viability of a robust, reliable microgrid for the City of False Pass, Alaska, with baseload load generation provided by a tidal power system, and (2) selected the components necessary to deliver the microgrid, including the particular specifics of the tidal power system, size and nature of the energy storage components required, particular power electronics required for grid following and grid forming operations, and identified several different centralized or decentralized microgrid controls approaches which are most appropriate for these systems. The Phase II technical approach will finalize the selection and design of an energy storage system, grid forming inverters, and a microgrid controller suitable for connection with an ORPC MRE power system on the False Pass grid. Acquisition of equipment and testing of the microgrid system in a laboratory environment is planned in the Phase II effort, before delivering, installing and testing the microgrid system on the False Pass grid for at least a six-month test. In conjunction with this work, ORPC will continue to assess the tidal resource, monitor and model existing grid operations, and develop plans for installation of an ORPC Power System in Isanotski strait. As a first-of-a-kind project utilizing tidal energy to offset diesel fuel use on an Alaskan microgrid, this Project has replicability for other communities in Alaska and worldwide. The technical proof of concept will further the state of the art for microgrids, providing a generation profile complimentary to the other renewable resources, enhancing grid resilience and reliability. These attributes are applicable to microgrids within the larger utility grids of the 48 contiguous states and will help provide distributed and robust power generation, which improves the security and reliability of the national grid."

In nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC we can produce and measure properties of a new state of matter, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), where quarks and gluons in a drop can reach a temperature of over 1013 Kelvin or above 200 MeV, similar to physical conditions existed in the Universe only 10-6 second after the Big Bang. The interactions among quarks and gluons are governed by the fundamental theory of QCD and the transition between quarks and hadrons in a large drop is a phase transition. Our scientific program centers on studies of the quark chirality effect in the QGP and the search for experimental signatures of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) resulting from domains with unequal numbers of left-handed and right-handed quarks interacting with magnetic field. QCD inspired calculations also predicted that there may be a critical point in the quark-hadron phase diagram and the search for the critical point has been a major RHIC scientific goal recently. Our proposed research will use the STAR isobar collision data and the STAR Beam Energy Scan phase II (BES II) data to search for the quark chirality effect and for possible manifestation of the critical point. We have developed a unique approach to measure proton number fluctuations in azimuthal partitions to search for critical local parton density fluctuations, complementary to previous event-by-event net proton fluctuations in a fixed rapidity window. We will complete our fluctuation studies from the BES I data and extend the analyses to the BES II data. The UCLA group has been a leading group in studying strange quark probes of the QCD matter since the beginning of RHIC. We will continue our measurements of strange quark production, taking advantage of the large increase in the BES II data sample. We will analyze the Omega and phi particle production from the BES II data to investigate strange quark properties near the QCD phase boundary. We will examine the feasibility of Lambda-Xi correlation measurements extending from our previous measurements of Lambda-Lambda and p-Omega correlations in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions. We will develop a program to study heavy quark energy loss and Upsilon production from the sPHENIX experiment. Our proposed research topics address key scientific questions of the RHIC program. We will continue to lead the operation and maintenance of the STAR Barrel EMC and SMD detector systems. In addition, the UCLA Group has been playing a key role in the STAR upgrade project for a Forward Calorimeter System, completed in 2021 and ready for physics data-taking by FY2022 Run. We will continue the detector R&D project for the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) focusing on new calorimeter detector technology. We have been engaged in synergistic activities among the STAR forward upgrade project, sPHENIX EMC construction and the EIC detector development.

Goebel, University of Memphis (Principal Investigator) The complexity of induced seismicity mechanisms significantly hampers seismic hazard assessment around injection wells. The largest magnitude events are commonly thought to be controlled by the size of the injection-affected area. However, what controls the size of this area and how important are regional tectonic structures? We propose to unravel the dominant mechanisms that promote far-reaching induced stress perturbations and earthquakes. While both pressure and elastic stress effects may trigger induced events at large distances from wells, the relative contribution of these effects to total seismic-moment-release remains to be understood. A key component in determining the importance of pressure vs. elastic stress effects are more robust constraints on crustal hydrology. We will study the processes that govern fault hydrology and slip using a multi-scale approach. We will measure fault-slip-induced permeability changes in a densely instrumented geothermal reservoir in Nevada. We will use rock-cores from this reservoir to perform earthquake-analog experiments and to examine the physical mechanisms of permeability changes. Based on insights from reservoir and lab studies, we will be able to model the extent of fluid migration from injection sites and compute the seismic energy released as a result of direct pressure vs. elastic stress effects. Insights from this study are expected to improve the understanding of coupled fault slip and hydrology as well as the overall hydraulic connectivity of upper crustal regimes. We will explore conditions that encourage slip-induced permeability enhancement and investigate implications for injection-induced seismic hazard."

Experimental efforts searching for dark matter particles over the last few decades have ruled out many candidates, and the new generation of tonne-scale liquid xenon detectors like the LUX-Zeplin (LZ) experiment will cover two more orders of magnitude in sensitivity. Recent theoretical work suggests that dark matter might be lighter than the optimal search range of experiments like LZ, and this research aims to enable LZ to search for an order of magnitude lighter dark matter masses by adding hydrogen to the liquid xenon, in an upgrade called HydroX. Being the lightest element, hydrogen is a much better target than xenon for searching for light dark matter because it is easier to transfer momentum between objects of similar mass, much like a ping pong ball cannot impart energy to a bowling ball. Considerations of the nature of signal generation in liquid xenon argue that the signal produced by a dark matter-hydrogen interaction will be significantly larger as well, further increasing the sensitivity to the lightest particles. By putting hydrogen into the existing LZ detector, this research capitalizes on the significant investment already made in LZ construction, taking advantage of the most radioactively quiet place on earth. The first priority of this research is to measure the response of liquid xenon to hydrogen and determine the ultimate sensitivity of HydroX. The work will observe how much hydrogen can be readily dissolved in liquid xenon, and then expose that mixture to very low energy neutron sources to mimic dark matter particles. The second part of the research will focus on the thermodynamics of hydrogen-doped liquid xenon. In LZ, 10 tonnes of liquid xenon are circulated through a purifier every 2.5 days, and major effort is needed to understand how to introduce hydrogen on that scale without upsetting the balance required to keep the liquid xenon cold. The final result of HydroX will be a fully characterized upgrade to LZ that will increase the sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude towards lower dark matter masses and hopefully to understand the mysterious nature of dark matter.

By applying our fundamental understanding of the strong nuclear force to descriptions of the atomic nuclei, the objective is to provide reliable descriptions of reaction processes and decays, with the aim to support experimental efforts as well as to reliably predict reactions that take place in astrophysical environments and at experiments with rare isotope beams (RIB). The work capitalizes on a symmetry-guided approach that, by exploiting symmetries known to dominate the dynamics, has enabled ab initio investigations of heavier nuclear species, deformed or not. In this approach, all participating particles are treated on the same footing within a shell model picture, while employing chiral effective field theory interactions between protons and neutrons. A main objective is to place unprecedented constraints on higher-order corrections in the beta decay of Boron-8, key to improving the sensitivity of high-precision experiments that probe the weak interaction theory and test physics beyond the Standard Model. These experiments have achieved remarkable precision that now requires confronting the systematic uncertainties that stem from the higher-order corrections in nuclear beta decay that are difficult to measure experimentally. This work will continue the study published in two recent letters, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 (2022) 202502 & Phys. Rev. Lett. 128 (2022) 202503, in collaboration with experimental groups at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, and other institutions that has improved the limit on the tensor current contribution to the weak interaction from measurements of the beta decay of Lithium-8 to Beryllium-8, a nucleus that is notoriously difficult to model due to its cluster structure and collective correlations, but become feasible for calculations in the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell model. In addition, this study will further our understanding of the Boron-8 neutrino spectrum, which provides the high-energy neutrinos from the Sun. Another objective focuses on theoretical developments that aim to improve reaction modeling by constructing the effective interaction between a target and a projectile from first principles (historically, referred to as an optical potential), which now account for the challenging microscopic structure of the participating nuclei. As these interactions are an essential input to numerous reaction models that are currently in use, the new developments serve as an important tool in a broad spectrum of studies. These projects pioneer ab initio investigations of intermediate- and medium-mass open shell nuclei with the aim to bridge from first principles to nuclear decays and reactions. The goal is to predict properties of experimentally inaccessible nuclei, including their decays and and reactions, by studying diverse nuclear systems, from well-known stable to rare isotopes. The critical need for this has been recently recognized, as such development is key to advancing our knowledge about nucleosynthesis, fundamental symmetries in nature, and reactions that will be experimentally studied at the Facility for Rare Isotopes Beams. While the proposed applications focus on specific important questions, these developments will have wider impact, as multi-physics simulations in the areas of nuclear energy and national security have similar needs. In addition, this research aims to strengthen the US nuclear theory effort by training the next-generation of scientists at the intersection of nuclear structure, reactions, and applications."

In order significantly reduce building energy consumption and meet national climate goals, innovative, cost-effective, re-cladding technologies must be deployed. HP Panel presents a viable alternative to the petrochemical-intensive retrofit wall panels currently available. Its wood fiber substrate has inherently high insulating value. The panel and substructure are OSHA-friendly and easy to install. Fabricated off-site, panels are controlled for quality and produce little material waste. In the field, panels are fit into a clip system, such that a small multi-family can be re-sided within a week. Unlike most over-cladding products, HP Panel is attractive and customizable. Thermal performance targets R-10 or better. The installed cost target is $20 per square foot. HP Tech is seeking funding to support refinement of proof-of-concept including streamlining the digitization of existing building measurement, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and easy field installation. Automated manufacture is central to the project approach, as is determination cost competitiveness with conventional building siding. Numerous industry standard tests and certifications will be required to bring the cladding system to market. The technical objectives of Phase I include 1) confirmation of the structural, thermal, and moisture behavior of the composite insulated panels; 2) confirmation of acceptable performance of the substructure and clip system, including transitions and panel- to-panel connections; and 3) confirmation of manufacturability. If carried over to Phase II and III the HP Panel has the potential to address the large and growing market of exterior cladding, projected to value $99 Billion by 2023. An opaque envelope upgrade can improve energy performance by 50%, substantially reducing air leakage and heat transfer through walls. As most residential building owners refurbish the envelope for aesthetics rather than performance, an attractive option benefits the built environment. Durability has the public benefit of reducing material and demolition waste in landfills. The ease of application benefits tenets. Fabricated off-site, the panels are easily installed such that an envelope retrofit can be completed within a work week."

The plant cell wall of energy crops provides the largest reservoir of raw materials for bioproducts. However, the widespread use of plant cell walls is hampered by their complexity and resistance to breakdown. To improve the productivity and cost-effectiveness of using energy crops to generate bioproducts, the fundamental problem of deconstructing plant cell walls must be addressed. In response to Topic 30a, this project will develop and evaluate an innovative genetic modification technology to produce strategically designed enzymes that specifically accumulate in the plant cell wall. The resulting enzyme-engineered energy crops are expected to grow normally under natural conditions but break down more quickly and easily under high temperature during the production of biobased products. As such, this plant cell wall targeting enzyme engineering effort will reduce the cost of plant cell wall deconstruction and ultimately improve the economics of bioproducts. The overall objective of this Phase I project is to develop and evaluate the enzyme engineering technology within energy crops. The concept will first be validated using tobacco plant, a model plant system that is typically used in lab testing for initial concept validation. Then the enzyme optimization will be validated using switchgrass, the energy crop to be used to produce bioproducts. This new enzyme optimization approach will be beneficial for bioindustries that use energy crops as feedstocks. It will improve the economic viability of converting energy crops to renewable products that support a sustainable society and helps address the Nation’s long-term strategic needs for renewable products and reduction of reliance on fossil resources."
Tracing the Cycling of Rare Earth Elements on Earth using Combined Isotopic and Vibrational Spectroscopic Approaches,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022451,"DAUPHAS, NICOLAS",NICOLAS.DAUPHAS@theuniversityofchicago,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are essential to the development and adoption of technological innovations. The demand for these element is rapidly growing due to increased usage in green technology (electric motors, wind turbines) and other industries, which could lead to demand outpacing supply if no mitigation measures are adopted. Furthermore, most of the world's supply is concentrated in a few mines, making these elements a geostrategic issue. REE ore deposits can take various forms, but a common trait of many of them is the involvement of magmatic processes to preconcentrate the REEs in certain rock types (carbonatites, alkaline/peralkaline igneous rocks, pegmatites) and certain minerals within these rock types (phosphates, carbonates). Alteration and physical erosion can mobilize the REEs to concentrate them in placer and residual clay deposits. The framework for interpreting these processes has always been equilibrium thermodynamics. The reason is that chemical abundances alone cannot be used to unambiguous recognize kinetic processes such as diffusion. Equilibrium and kinetic processes, especially those relating to transport, can impart peculiar signatures to isotopic ratios, which we will use to better understand how REEs are concentrated in ore deposits. This is a broad and ambitious undertaking, which is the reason why we will focus on the concentration of REEs in igneous rocks and minerals, which is often the first step in the formation of ore deposits. In igneous rocks, crystallization of minerals that exclude REEs from their networks is thought to play a critical role in concentrating REEs in the residual liquid. This process is most often understood in terms of equilibrium partitioning between minerals and melts. It is conceivable, however, that kinetic processes, most importantly diffusion, played a significant role in REE concentration and fractionation. In the proposed work, we will examine REE isotopic fractionation to tell whether diffusive processes were involved in the formation of ore deposits, focusing on peralkaline silicate systems, which are better understood than other systems. We will start by establishing expectations for equilibrium and diffusion driven kinetic isotopic fractionation. Equilibrium isotopic fractionation will be assessed by measuring the phonon density of states (PDOS) and force constants of Eu and Dy in materials relevant to magmatic differentiation. These measurements will be done using the synchrotron technique of Nuclear Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering on the Mössbauer isotopes 151Eu and 161Dy. Knowing the PDOS will allow us to calculate the reduced partition function ratios, from which equilibrium isotopic fractionation factors can be calculated. Expectations for diffusion-driven kinetic isotopic fractionation will be defined based on diffusion couple experiments that will allow us to quantity differences in diffusivities between REE isotopes. Knowing this, we will be able to model how crystal growth fractionates REE elements and isotopes. For example, most REEs are incompatible in feldspar and as a result, they accumulate in a diffusive boundary layer when the crystal grows, which can potentially produce significant isotopic fractionation in the crystals and residual liquid. We will measure the REE isotopic compositions of feldspar and bulk rocks from the island of Pantelleria (Italy), where REE-rich peralkaline rocks can be found, which are thought to be derived from transitional basalts by fractional crystallization. We will thus be able to evaluate whether natural samples carry the isotopic telltale signatures of equilibrium and kinetic processes. The approach that we propose relies on several novel concepts and approaches. Our group has unique combined expertise in NRIXS, diffusion-transport modeling, and REE isotopic analyses that will allow us to tell whether the equilibrium thermodynamics framework used to describe REE enrichment is justified or not. This work may guide future REE prospecting and retrieval strategies, as diffusive effects would not concentrate REE uniformly in a rock or mineral, and the process of REE fractionation associated with phase growth may be reproduced industrially to separate REEs from each other."

Proposed herein is a highly multidisciplinary research effort that couples chemical synthesis and biomolecular design with state-of-the art methods for structural and functional characterization (X-ray crystallography and scattering, electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, chemical synthesis). The efforts described here encompass several objectives of the Biomolecular Materials Program in the DOE Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering, including the understanding and spatial and temporal control of bioinspired energy-efficient self-assembly pathways to create energy-related and resilient materials under mild-conditions. Objective 1- To expand the supramolecular protein design toolkit by constructing dynamic, woven protein assemblies:The utility of proteins as functional materials would be significantly broadened through access to a large arsenal of chemical bonding and protein design strategies, which would enable chemically/physically tunable interactions between proteins. Accordingly, our goal in this funding period is to enrich our chemical/protein design toolkit by designing 2- and 3-D protein arrays with mechanically interlocking, “woven” topologies. This Objective will furnish a new approach in the bottom-up design of protein assemblies, paving the way to dynamic protein-based materials with superior mechanical properties. Objectives 2 and 3- To develop hierarchical protein materials with emergent dynamic and functional properties: Natural protein assemblies like viruses, microtubules, and collagen superstructures have remarkable mechanical and functional attributes yet to be matched by rational design. Ultimately, however, the functions and biological utility of many protein assemblies and protein-based materials depend largely on their ability to interface with other biological or abiological components to form hierarchical systems. Such hierarchical assembly not only leads to emergent properties that arise from combining multiple components, but also augments the individual properties (e.g., catalysis, stability) of the components themselves. Building on the recent progress we have made, we will develop two classes of 3D protein crystalline materials that integrate protein components with polymer networks (Objective 2) and hydrogen-bonded organic or metal-organic frameworks (HOFs and MOFs) (Objective 3). Whereas the dynamicity of the polymer-protein crystal hybrids will render them adaptive and allow the construction of multi-protein systems through selective uptake, the simultaneous rigidity and porosity of the MOF/HOF-protein crystalline frameworks will yield functional protein materials that are capable of functioning under non-biological conditions. Both systems will allow the study and manipulation of the protein-polymer and protein-HOF/MOF interfaces for controlling material structure and dynamics at the bulk scale."

However, the high level of light intensity that is commonly used for such NLO imaging microscopies can often cause photobleaching and photodamage, severely disturbing biological processes and functions, and compromising viability. This phototoxicity is particularly problematic for gaining a comprehensive understanding of biological function, which often necessitates prolonged imaging measurements. The quantum nature of light provides promising opportunities to enable noninvasive and nondestructive bioimaging. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop multimodal quantum NLO imaging modalities based on a squeezed-light source for co-registered steady-state two-photon-excited fluorescence, two-photon-excited fluorescence lifetime and second-harmonic generation microscopies. The proposed research will involve development of squeezed-light sources and frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime characterization techniques, along with methods for measuring molecular cross-sections and the advantage of quantum imaging modalities over their corresponding classical equivalents. The imaging studies will center on developing the co-registered multimodal quantum NLO microscope and its critical validation through visualizing the growth and dynamics of a phenazine-producing bacterium, such as Pseudomonas sp. GM17, in a synthetic microbial community and during plant colonization to examine the feasibility of using phenazine as an intrinsic probe to identify and track specific bacterial strains, especially how the presence of a phenazine-producing microbe influences the spatial organization and composition of the community. This proposed research further seeks to address fundamental questions that are essential for the applications of emerging quantum light approaches in bioimaging but are currently either under considerable debate or have remained unexplored. First, how large is the quantum advantage in multiphoton excitation efficiency with squeezed light compared to classical light? Second, what are the advantages of using squeezed light compared to the femtosecond pulsed lasers for multiphoton NLO imaging of live bacteria in terms of photoinduced stress and photodamage? More broadly, what are the biological effects of quantum light illumination versus classical illumination?

Thus, the best niobium cavities are close to their intrinsic performance limit, so the next breakthrough to the linear accelerators producing the accelerating gradients &sim;100 MV/m at 2K or &sim;50 MV/m at 4.2K principally requires new superconducting materials with the superheating critical magnetic fields more than twice of that for niobium. Many such materials exist, but they can sustain the equatorial magnetic fields higher than that of niobium only if the field onset of penetration of superconducting vortices is delayed up to the critical field at the cavity equator. This can be achieved using a suggestion of the PI to coat the niobium cavities with superconductor/dielectric multilayers. The feasibility of this approach, which opens up an opportunity of significant (more than two-fold) increase of accelerating gradients as compared to the existing niobium cavity technology, has been tested by several groups worldwide. The objective of this proposal is to address many outstanding scientific and technological issues of the multilayer coating for which interconnected physics and materials issues must be understood before scaling up the multilayer technology to the next generation cavities, which can potentially reach the accelerating gradients 100 MV/m or more. That includes the choice of the right coating material and its optimization with impurities and growth conditions, the quality of films, surface morphology, properties of grain boundaries and interfaces between superconducting and dielectric layers, understanding the effect of overheating and theoretical performance limits in multilayers under strong radio-frequency fields. In this proposal we will address these key issues, by producing test single film and multilayer samples made of the most promising materials such as Nb3Sn, NbTiN, recently discovered iron pnictides, and possibly others. We will also pursue novel approaches to develop alloyed niobium multilayer coatings (particularly nitrogen-doped) which will allow us to use the proven niobium technology and take advantage of the extended increase of the quality factor with the radio-frequency field as has been observed on nitrogen-doped niobium cavities, while increasing the breakdown field up to 50% above the best niobium cavities due to a new multilayer effect. The multilayer test samples with different concentrations of impurities will be grown under different controlled conditions by the group at the University of Wisconsin which has already achieved significant advances in growing Nb3Sn and multilayers which demonstrated good performance under low radiofrequency electromagnetic field. These samples will be thoroughly characterized and tested at the Accelerator Center at Old Dominion University and Jefferson National Laboratory where the surface resistance, quality factors and the breakdown magnetic fields will be measured using a newly built quadrupole resonator and other specially designed and built experimental setups. This experimental work will be combined with by in-depth theory development to understand the performance limits in multilayers and ways of their optimization, which can benefit from our recent advances in theories of microwave suppression of surface resistance and optimal multilayer geometry. The ability to test multiple sample geometries and materials and tune many different materials parameters in controlled way will enable us to greatly accelerate select the optimal multilayer coating to be use in the next generation of radio-frequency superconducting resonator cavities."
Single-molecule Dynamics in interface-rich Separations Environments,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0001854,"Schwartz, Daniel",Daniel.Schwartz@theregentsoftheuniversityofcoloradod/b/auniversityofcolorado,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Most energy-related separations technologies involve transport through complex and heterogeneous environments, including the entry and exit of molecules into nano-porous sorbents, passage through high surface area filtration membranes, ionic transport through domains in nominally non-porous ionomers, and many others. Various other energy-related processes, including extraction/remediation in the porous and fractured sub-surface environment and ion transport within electrochemical energy storage devices, involve nearly identical phenomena. Notably, recent DOE “Basic Needs” workshop reports emphasize the need to develop and employ novel methods to characterize the transport of macromolecules, ions, and/or (nano)particles in complex and interface-rich materials and environments. A common theme amongst these challenges involves the need to understand complex and selective separations environments, where molecules and nanoparticles interact with materials and interfaces via subtle chemical and physical interactions. Because of the complexity of coupled mechanisms, and of the presence of structural and dynamic heterogeneity, conventional macroscopic characterization methods do not provide a sufficient mechanistic understanding of these phenomena. As a result, it has been challenging to understand why some materials and processes under-perform, and to develop improved separation processes and materials in a rational way. Advanced imaging methods can address these knowledge gaps. Imaging methods that can simultaneously map heterogeneous complex separations environments and quantitatively probe the distinctive motion of molecules and particles are needed to elucidate the mechanisms that affect performance of separation systems. Leveraging unique techniques developed in the prior DOE-supported research, this research employs real-time single-molecule and single-nanoparticle imaging methods to elucidate transport, affinity, and interactions at interfaces and in confined environments that are relevant to separations processes. The approach is based on high-throughput observations of individual molecules and nanoparticles using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, double-helix point spread function imaging, and high-resolution spectral methods involving resonance energy transfer. Methods like these are uniquely capable of characterizing dynamic interactions of molecules and nanoparticles within complex, interface-rich separations environments. This research is expected to lead to high performance next-generation separation processes that employ novel components such as dynamically cross-linked materials and self-propelling particles, which have potential to enhance separation throughput while reducing the deactivation of materials through fouling and other mechanisms of degradation."

They are key drivers of the ongoing revolution in molecular biology and of many areas of biotechnology, including development of pharmaceuticals, of enzymes and light harvesters for bioenergy, and of engineered organisms for bioremediation. As a result of recent advances in the technical capabilities of electron microscopes and detectors, single- particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful approach to obtaining near-atomic- resolution structures of large biomolecular complexes, membrane proteins, and other targets of major scientific interest to bioenergy, including targets that have been intractable to other structural methods. The primary obstacle to obtaining high resolution structures are now most often associated with sample preparation. This Phase I SBIR project will focus on two key sample preparation challenges in single-particle cryo-EM: obtaining sample films of a target thickness on cryo-EM support foils to maximize image contrast; and reproducibly cooling these samples to obtain largely vitrified ice and minimal beam-induced motion suitable for high resolution imaging. Advances in electron microscopes and detectors have also greatly enhanced the capabilities of micro- electron diffraction (micro-ED), allowing atomic resolution structures to be determined from nanometer size crystals that have been intractable to X-ray-based methods. Key challenges here are again associated with sample preparation and mounting for efficient data collection. To obtain sample films of a target thickness for single-particle cryo-EM, methods will be developed to fabricate nanometer-thick sample support foils having contact line pinning steps and holes of different depth, and the resulting dynamics and thicknesses of dispensed liquids will be compared with those on conventional foils. To uniformly deposit very small amounts of sample liquid over the active area of the foil and to remove excess liquid, deposition devices based on micropillar arrays will be developed. To improve sample cryocooling outcomes, the detailed processes that occur as a cryo-EM grid enters a liquid cryogen will be studied, with emphasis on interfacial interactions between liquid cryogen and sample support materials. Drawing on MiTeGen’s broad expertise in developing sample supports for X-ray crystallography, novel concepts for foils and grids to address sample handling in micro-ED will be evaluated. The proposed work, if successful, will lead to commercial development of sample supports and sample deposition systems with potential to substantially increase the throughput of cryo-EM structure determination pipelines, allow much more efficient use of expensive cryo-TEM facilities, and improve overall data quality. This will support cryo-EM studies of key biomolecular structures and interactions used by microbes and plants relevant to bioenergy and bioremediation, topics of major interest to the DOE.

Zakharov (Principal Investigator) LiWFusion, P.O. Box 2391, Princeton NJ 08543 The project will develop the theory and computational support for innovative plasma regime studies conducted on Lithium Tokamak Experiment device in Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The LTX is a unique spherical tokamak capable to utilize plasma pumping by liquid lithium in the presence of Neutral Beam Injection (NBI). This capacity alone provides the advantage in energy confinement relative to the non-lithium tokamak regimes. Earlier in 2005, the four-fold enhancement of the energy confinement time was achieved on CDX-U machine, the predecessor of LTX. Recently LTX- upgraded its power supply and is now capable to run the plasma current exceeding 100 kA. Motivated by simulations of 3dOrb numerical code of PI this upgrade significantly improved the capture of energetic NBI ions by the plasma. The goal of this collaboration proposal is to assist the LTX- experimental team in these outstanding efforts in developing a better approach to magnetic fusion. The proposal will provide the understanding of opportunities and limitations in development of LiWF regime for specific LTX- environment: spherical tokamak geometry, highly conducting shell with 3-D geometry, small plasma size and partial beam capture, residual influx of neutral atoms from the wall. The present proposal will address the urgent needs of LTX- experiments in understanding of short and long term confinement of energetic ions in presence of magnetic perturbations, pitch angle scattering and energy decay due to friction with plasma electrons. The theory of variances in equilibrium reconstructions, developed by PI, will be implemented on LTX- through the upgrade of equilibrium and stability code ESC. This will determine the quality of reconstruction and optimization of measurements. The new equilibrium reconstruction technique based on the use of so-called response functions will be implemented on LTX- . It uses the time history of magnetic configuration in order to properly assess the contribution of eddy currents to measurements and include it in reconstruction. The new toroidal perturbed equilibrium code TPE will be developed for LTX- and used for assessing the effect of 3-dimensional magnetic perturbations on confinement of energetic ions. All these developments will give the further guidance for enhancing LTX- capacities and per- formance of its plasma in the regime with plasma pumping by lithium and with NBI fueling."

In the crystalline diamond material system, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers have been utilized at the laboratory level to create a number of exciting quantum sensor and other quantum technology devices and components, many of which show high levels of performance during room temperature testing and evaluation. A clean, reliable, and reproducible manufacturable process for creating high quality diamond materials with NV centers which are controllably positioned, and which have optimized optical and spin properties is of great interest. The team of Great Lakes Crystal Technologies (GLCT) and its research partner Michigan State University (MSU) will apply and extend MSU’s patented technology in microwave plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology which GLCT has licensed, in combination with advanced femtosecond laser processing and materials characterization technologies developed at MSU to create ultra-high quality CVD diamond materials with controlled arrays of high performance NV centers which in turn will be used to advance the state of the art in magnetic field sensing. We will begin by synthesizing low strain isotopically purified diamond wafers which contain a thin high concentration layer of delta-doped nitrogen at a controllable distance from the surface. Next, we’ll process the samples using lithography, advanced ion implantation and annealing. Specifically, we will activate a periodic array of NV centers in each wafer, using a femtosecond laser annealing process for one wafer and an electron beam irradiation and annealing process for the other wafer. Lastly, we’ll characterize the wafers using photoluminescence spectroscopy and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy to compare their spectral responses, with the goal of understanding the best approach to take forward into Phase II. The proposed technology has a multitude of potential applications in quantum information and optics, navigation and geoscience probes, and nano-sensing in condensed-matter physics, and could inform many other diamond-based approaches to quantum encryption and quantum computing."

Balazs, University of Pittsburgh Public Abstract In nature, the energy released from enzymatic reactions “fuels” a range of mechanical processes, from metabolic events to large-scale motion. Inspired by this mode of biological chemo-mechanical transduction, the aim of the research is to design 2D catalyst-coated, flexible sheets that generate chemical energy, which propels the surrounding fluid and the immersed sheets. These systems are distinctive because the fluid not only affects the motion of the sheet, but also drives the deformable sheets to exhibit unprecedented forms of structural reconfiguration and self-organization. Furthermore, the sheets exert forces on the fluid that modify the fluid flow. Hence, the system exhibits a feedback loop that can lead to novel non-linear dynamic behavior. The studies are aimed at establishing design rules for controllably tuning this complex dynamics and thereby driving the sheets to spontaneously morph into 3D structures that perform mechanical work in fluids. The research approach combines theory and simulation to design chemically active, flexible sheets to achieve functionality that is not possible with chemically active stationary walls or mobile hard particles. Changes in the shape, the patterning of catalysts on the sheet, and the geometry of the chamber can all influence the system’s dynamics. Clearly, computational models are necessary to probe the rich design space. These studies will develop relationships among the features of the sheet, the chemically-generated pattern of fluid flow and the sheet’s final 3D shape. With this as a foundation, the work will then examine the interactions among multiple sheets to uncover new forms of self-organization. The findings from these studies will impact both fundamental science and technological applications. Namely, the findings will facilitate the creation of biomimetic materials that utilize chemo-mechanical energy transduction to perform useful work, including directing the assembly and collective behavior of active self-morphing sheets in solution. Moreover, the studies will provide significant insight into controlling the behavior of systems operating out of equilibrium. The advent of materials systems where a single 2D sample can morph on-demand into a variety of distinct 3D shapes has the potential to significantly simplify and improve the energy efficiency of manufacturing processes. Such reconfigurable, self-propelled sheets can also greatly expand the functionality of fluidic devices, allowing these devices to perform self-sustained operations that were previously unattainable with stationary chemical pumps or active hard particles."

The MFE effort seeks to confine hot plasmas using magnetic fields to allow nuclei to fuse and release large amounts of energy in a fusion power plant. The closures developed by USU's fusion theory and computation group assume that the magnetic field is strong, much stronger than earth's, for example, and the complementary methods are referred to as ""continuum"" and ""general moment"" approaches. They differ in their representation for the distribution functions, which probabilistically describe the density of electrons and ions in a 5 dimensional space. In magnetized plasmas, the charged particle trajectories are tied closely to the magnetic field lines. Both approaches account for binary interactions between particles using the Coulomb collision operator. Theoretical and computational development along both lines provides avenues for verification between the two approaches. USU will further develop physically accurate and numerically efficient models that advance our understanding of experiments like ITER. The ITER device will prove the physical practicality of thermonuclear fusion and is expected to producie 500 megawatts of fusion power.

Halo monitoring is also very important at modern x-ray light sources in particular the ones with in-vacuum undulators to protect permanent magnets from radiation damage caused by the beam halo. Traditional wire scanner measurement utilizing carbon or tungsten wires is limited by the damage threshold of these materials. These devices have to be routinely serviced due to beam-induced damage of the wires. Euclid Techlabs LLC proposes an electrodeless method to measure halo with a diamond scraper. This measurement utilizes a microwave resonator placed around the beamline element which is sensitive to charged particle-induced conductivity. Microwave resonator detuning measurement, having an incredible dynamic range of six orders of magnitude is expected to be very sensitive. Diamond is chosen as a radiation hard material with excellent thermal properties. The absence of electrodes makes the device robust under the beam. In Phase I, we produced a prototype resonator with a diamond sensor element that was characterized on the bench. Two version of the resonator were built. It was discovered that motorization of the scanning measurement is complicated engineering-wise due to non-existent commercially ultra-high vacuum RF cables which are flexible. A simplified resonator was used similarly to a Faraday cup in our 10 keV electron gun testing beamline. The microwave detuning measurement proved to be a lot more sensitive than a standard Faraday cup. We also simulated halo scanning process and developed a halo map retrieval procedure based on the scan results. In Phase II, we will perform a high-power test of the microwave detuning device built in phase I which will visualize electron beam via fluorescence and at the same time provide a measurement of the beam intensity. We will design and fabricate a similar device with the scanning capability. This design will be based either on custom bellows frame or will utilize an in-vacuum flexible RF cable which we are looking to develop. There is a strong interest in accelerator and plasma community to have a high quality, flexible, UHV- compatible cable. In the end of Phase II work, the halo scanner will be tested at the AWA facility of Argonne National Lab. The proposed approach is robust, plug and play and can be employed in a large number of accelerator facilities all over the world. This no-electrical-contact diamond-based halo measurement can potentially replace wire scanners which require routine maintenance."

The proposed research has two main thrusts: the systematic exploration of the electrodynamics of graphene and graphene-based heterostructures in previously unattainable regimes of electric current flow (Thrust 1) and the investigation of massive electronic charge transfer at the interface of graphene with a-RuCl3 (Thrust 2). The electronic system of graphene is unique. Graphene’s combination of exceptionally high electronic mobility even at ambient temperature, thermal conductivity, exceptional current densities, and other stunning properties is the focus of a world-wide research effort. The superb electronic and photonic properties of graphene have reinvigorated interest in other materials whose bulk compounds consist of weakly coupled atomic layers. Heterostructures assembled from graphene and other atomically thin crystalline layers of van der Waals (vdW) materials are emerging as a new paradigm in the design of materials with tailored physical properties. The PI will investigate two new classes of physical phenomena in graphene-based vdW heterostructures: Thrust 1. The PI will study surface plasmon polariton propagation in current-carrying graphene devices. Preliminary data by the PI uncovered the effect of plasmonic drag by electrical currents. These preliminary findings pave the way for the systematic imaging of the current flow patterns in graphene in both ohmic and hydrodynamic regimes. Thrust 2. The PI will harness surface plasmon polaritons to quantify charge transfer across graphene/a-RuCl3 interfaces. a-RuCl3 is interesting in its own right: the Mott insulator and quantum spin liquid candidate material. The PI will visualize the spatial inhomogeneity associated with the charge transfer and will probe the dynamics in the top atomic layers on the a-RuCl3 side of the interface proximal to graphene. Successful realization of the proposed program relies, in part, on the exceptional potential of nano-infrared methods for studying charge dynamics in solids and for visualizing complex effects at the nanoscale. The proposed studies of the plasmonic drag have been made possible by the recent leap in technical capabilities in the field of IR nano-optics by the PI. The proposed research will help to elucidate the roles of electron-electron interaction, many-body effects, and the properties associated with ballistic transport of highly mobile electrons in graphene, all of which are contemporary topics of high importance in the field. The proposed nano-imaging approach is well suited for inquiries in electronic dynamics that remained elusive in transport or common spectroscopy measurements. Research described in this proposal is directly relevant to a DOE Grand Challenge: How do remarkable properties of matter emerge from complex correlations of the atomic and electronic constituents and how can we control these properties? The proposed program is aimed at utilizing two under-exploited methods of controlling quantum phenomena in vdW material: electrical manipulation of hybrid light-matter polaritons (Thrust 1) and interface charge transfer (Thrust 2)."

The goal of this research is to demonstrate and develop in-depth understanding of novel quantum phenomena in all-2D van der Waals heterostructures with enhanced spin interactions. The three-year objectives include: 1) fabrication of new hybrid magnetic/nonmagnetic 2D van der Waals heterostructures such as WTe2/Cr2Ge2Te6 and WSe2/graphene/Cr2Ge2Te6 with tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling and demonstration of induced linear and nonlinear anomalous transport phenomena; 2) experimental determination of relevant interaction strength and associated physical properties, and control of the interaction strength via adjusting material properties or applying external stimuli; 3) demonstration of epitaxial growth of a-RuCl3 Kitaev quantum spin liquid thin films and van der Waals heterostructures such as WTe2/a-RuCl3; 4) investigation of characteristic properties in different phases of a-RuCl3, especially the gapless modes associated with the fractionalized Majorana fermions in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid phase via nonlocal spin transport. These bold experimental explorations will be augmented by strong collaborations with leading theorists using analytical models and the first-principles calculations. Building on the success in 2D van der Waals materials and fabrication capability upgrade in the present award period, the PI proposes to advance the heterostructure approach that he pioneered in previous award periods. The proposed refined heterostructure approach contains the following unique key ingredients. 1) Hybrid heterostructures are composed of only 2D van der Waals monolayers or few atomic layers to greatly enhance spin interactions across the atomically layered interfaces. 2) An emphasis is placed on the tunability of various parameters such as layer thickness, carrier density, and applied electric field via dual gates to control spin interactions. 3) Epitaxial thin film growth of a-RuCl3 ensures excellent interface quality and large areas for device fabrication. Successful thin film growth will enable a class of new spin transport experiments that do not require large crystals and promote an in-depth understanding of Kitaev quantum spin liquid physics. The proposed research leverages PI’s expertise in nanofabrication, epitaxial thin film growth, and spin transport studies. Significance. All-2D van der Waals spin heterostructure research is a leading frontier area in condensed matter physics and materials science. The proposed quantum phenomena, including topological phase transitions in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, quantum anomalous Hall effect in “heavy graphene”, and spin transport in quantum spin liquid gapless edge modes, have not yet been explored. This particular research direction presents both great challenges and enormous opportunities. The PI is well positioned to tackle many challenges. Additionally, the novel quantum spin phenomena in 2D van der Waals heterostructures are of high relevance to future generations of ultralow-power electronics and spintronics as well as topological quantum computing."

The specific research goals are: to tailor building blocks to achieve unprecedented control over network formation; exploit dynamic interactions to “re-manufacture’ materials without extensive processing; and harness gels as bio-inspired chemical reactors to capture the efficiency of biological “factories”. The research approach combines theory and experiments to design: 1) tunable macromolecular building blocks for fabricating polymeric networks; 2) reversible bonding interactions that permit the dynamic reorganization of the networks in response to energy inputs (i.e., various external stimuli); and 3) bio-inspired network “nanoreactors” for novel and energy/material efficient modes of chemical synthesis. The macromolecular building blocks can be stars, bottlebrushes, telechelic blocks and gradient copolymers, as well as hybrid nanoparticles or other extended architectures; the intrinsic properties of these blocks can be altered, even after they are incorporated into a network. This structural tunability of the blocks enhances the ability to tailor the networks with a wide range of properties for specific applications. With the appropriate choice of chemistries, the dynamic bonds interlinking the building blocks can be cleaved and reshuffled to form new interconnections and architectures to provide a range of different functions. The work will also involve preformed micro- to meso-scale gels as basic modular units, which are then reversibly bound into an extended network. The advantage of this approach is that each preformed, modular gel unit can encompass distinct structural and physical properties and hence, heterogeneous networks can be created that exhibit collective properties not achievable with just one module. The findings from these studies will impact work in scientific fields aimed at: building complex hierarchical structures by mimicking nature's directed-assembly approaches, creating functional systems with collective properties not achievable by simply summing the individual components, and devising bioinspired routes for the synthesis of energy relevant materials. This work will also open new, energy efficient routes for creating multiple materials from limited resources."

In Phase I Giner will develop and synthesize the polymer composite material in house using VectranTM and graphite loaded polyphenylene sulfide. UCI will design a 3-D fuel cell model with a bipolar plate sub-model utilizing the composite material properties as an input to predict electron and heat transport properties. UTK will 3D print small scale samples and supply them to Giner for extensive ex-situ characterization. Finally, Hyzon will help validate the bipolar plate performance under heavy duty operating conditions. In Phase II the composite BPs will be scaled up using injection molding, and delivered directly to a major industry partner, Hyzon, from where they will reach the domestic heavy duty FC market. This will lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions by replacing diesel motors in trucks with zero emission electric powertrains, dramatically improving overall air quality, in line with DOE mission. Our novel material can also be used in PEM electrolyzers, alkaline fuel cells/electrolyzers, or aircraft and space applications."
Tuning the Ion Size Selectivity of Macrocyclic Aqueous Complexants for Use in Rare Earth Element Separations,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021662,"Wilson, Justin",Justin.Wilson@cornelluniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","The rare earth elements are critical resources that are used in a wide range of technological applications, including wind turbines, liquid crystal displays, batteries, and portable electronics. In recent years, the domestic supply chain of the rare earth elements has been an object of concern, because the purified form of these elements is primarily sourced from foreign nations. Although natural deposits of the rare earth elements are available domestically, environmental and cost-related concerns render these inaccessible from an economic perspective. A major cost-driving and environmental factor in obtaining the rare earth elements, which occur in nature together, is their separation. Because these elements have similar chemical properties, their separation requires multiple steps that are energy-intensive and produce hazardous waste. Hence, this project addresses these challenges by exploring novel strategies to separate the rare earth elements. Specifically, the project investigates chemical receptors, or ligands, that can bind, or chelate, the different rare earth elements with different affinities. By tuning the relative affinities of these ligands, the successful approach will strengthen the foundations for more efficient domestic separation of the rare earth elements. The first objective of this project is to synthesize new ligands with distinct chemical modifications to alter their rare earth-selectivity profiles. In the second objective, these ligands are further fine-tuned for different rare earth elements by altering their secondary, or outer-sphere, interactions. In the final objective, these ligands are applied to demonstrate the separation of the individual rare earth elements using solvent extraction techniques. Collectively, this work explores the possibilities for more energy-efficient, less emissive separation of the rare earth elements in support of making domestic supply chains of purified critical resources accessible."

Under these conditions, the ideal gas equation of state is not valid. Although considerable advances have been made regarding real-gas equations of state for thermodynamic properties, the same cannot be said of chemical kinetics under extreme pressures. The standard approach in computational kinetics assumes that reactions occur under isolated conditions. Real-gas behavior can have a profound effect on the chemical source terms in reactive flow simulations. These many-body interactions can change both the rate constants and the product branching fractions. In this proposal, we will set forth a methodology to quantify many-body effects on transition states and thence high-pressure effects on rate constants. The specific aims are: (i) develop chemically accurate surrogate potential energy surfaces for computational kinetics with explicit solvent molecules, and use this surrogate model within molecular dynamics simulations; (ii) quantify the effects of high pressures on the rate constants for H-abstraction and retro-Diels-Alder; (iii) determine the pressure at which solvent cage effects will cause the branching fractions in bond-fission reactions to favor molecular elimination products; (iv) perform shock tube experiments to validate the theoretical predictions; and (v) analyze the results for possible trends that can be applied heuristically. Many civilian and military applications would benefit directly from this research, such as supercritical fluids, combustion, and propulsion. Moreover, the ability to create and use potentials and forces with chemical accuracy in molecular dynamics simulations will have broad interest in the Basic Energy Science program, especially the Chemical Physics groups."

Schlom (Cornell University) Co-Principle Investigators: Craig J. Fennie (Cornell University) David A. Muller (Cornell University) Abstract Objectives: Starting at the level of electrons and atoms our long-term goal is to rationally design complex oxide heterostructures and interface-materials with targeted emergent behaviors. We will apply our materials-by-design approach to identify new, low-symmetry metallic materials: non-centrosymmetric metals, which may also lack time-reversal symmetry. The scientific driver of our proposed effort is to discover the physics that can come from deliberately not coupling to the linear (i.e., standard) dipole fields, but deliberately and effectively coupling to the higher-order multipole fields. By doing so we will expose previously hidden properties. These include non-linear effects that involve multiple fields (non-linear magnetoelectric, magneto-optic, and magnetothermal effects) including the gyrotropic magnetic effect and dynamical (magneto)piezoelectric effects. These objectives relate to a central underlying issue-how nanoscale architecture (interfaces, layer terminations, the wavelength of composition modulation, strain, connectivity, etc.), rather than overall composition alone, determine the multifunctional properties of complex oxides. Approach: Our team identifies specific microscopic mechanisms leading to the desired macroscopic response and combines them with basic principles of crystal chemistry and symmetry analysis to formulate a set of materials design rules that go from a model to real materials. These design rules are then combined with first-principles methods, which have the capability to study the properties of materials at the level of atoms and electrons without the need for empirical input, to survey the vast space of possible materials to select the most promising candidates to target for synthesis. Given the complexity of the problem, it is not surprising that this rational design criteria often leads to structures that do not exist in nature and cannot be produced by conventional bulk synthesis routes. Instead, our team will create the targeted artificial materials in epitaxial films with atomic precision by molecular-beam epitaxy using epitaxial stabilization and symmetry breaking, image their chemical structure including defects at the atomic scale by scanning transmission electron microscopy, and work with collaborators to establish their relevant macroscopic properties. Impact: Our work will enable the controlled synthesis of a new frontier of oxide structures, add a higher dimension to property control, and provide the ability to see multipole order. Of even greater impact, however, is the establishment of a new paradigm for the rational design and synthesis of materials-including metastable or highly strained structures created with atomic layer precision-with targeted properties. Our prior work demonstrates the promise of this bottom-up strategy. Our materials-by-design team approach relates directly to three of DOE&rsquo;s grand challenges including designing and perfecting revolutionary new forms of matter with tailored properties."

Jain, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Lehigh University Co-PI: V. Dierolf, Department of Physics, Lehigh University ABSTRACT Single crystals of specified composition, size, shape and form are needed for harnessing, generating, conserving, and storing energy efficiently. In particular, engineered crystals with hierarchical structures are desired, which would yield properties and performance that are not possible with currently available materials. This project attempts to develop a fundamental understanding of the formation of crystal architectures that are based on the discovery of a new class of hierarchical metamaterials by investigators’ group, called rotating lattice single (RLS) crystal. This special type of hierarchical crystals is characterized by an ordered variation of the orientation of a single crystal lattice. These structures are fabricated using a novel materials synthesis technique via a solid-to-solid transformation of glass into a crystal through local heating with a laser. In contrast to fixed connectivity between different Lego-like building pieces, it is akin to building a complex architecture from a rubble of Lego blocks such that the connection between them can be controlled and manipulated precisely by the far-from-equilibrium conditions provided by a laser. To avail novel properties of such RLS crystals, the ability to control all aspects of their hierarchical growth is needed, which will require a detailed knowledge of the early stages of crystal formation, the interaction between the crystal and the surrounding glass, as well as the dynamics of the glass to crystal transformation at the growth front. Thus, the overall goals of the project are: (a) Define and understand the mutual interaction of the crystal with the surrounding glass during growth. (b) Observe and understand the evolution of the crystal in its earliest stages when its orientation is established through the crystal/glass interaction and/or externally introduced anisotropic forces. The answers to the most important synthesis science questions pertaining to these goals have been formulated in five hypotheses, which will be tested using judiciously selected in situ, real-time characterization techniques at Lehigh and three National Labs, and combine them with atomistic simulations and machine learning approaches. The project will be completed by two long-collaborating PIs with complementary expertise in glass science and laser-material interactions, a postdoctoral research associate and a graduate student."

But without a clear understanding of reaction mechanisms, answers about the structural properties of rare nuclear isotopes cannot be extracted from the experiments. The PI is currently studying the physics of nuclei with large excess of neutrons to provide theoretical support and predictions for experiments at radioactive beam facilities. The PI's group is studying reaction theory related to multichannel scattering, the influence of the continuum, medium effects, relativistic corrections, and other reaction theory topics. Together with experimentalists worldwide he has participated in proposing new experiments to verify existing theoretical predictions. The project also exploits the connections between nuclear and atomic systems and provides an excellent opportunity for productive cross-fertilization between these areas.

However, the microbes currently used for industrial biofuel production cannot break down the plant cell wall material (or plant biomass) into its component sugars unless it is previously partially broken apart with heat and chemicals. Anaerobic fungi that live in the guts of animals that eat plants have the capacity to degrade plant biomass more efficiently than industrial microorganisms and without the need for prior treatment. In spite of the natural advantages of these fungi, they are not used industrially because no genetic tools are available to identify and manipulate the enzymes that constitute the biochemical machinery responsible for their biomass degradation capabilities. This project will develop and leverage high resolution -omics resources to better understand the physiology of anaerobic fungi using systems and synthetic biology approaches. Novel genetic and epigenetic tools will be designed to engineer new strains of anaerobic fungi with improved biomass degradation capacity. In parallel, cell-free strategies will be applied to rapidly characterize fungal proteins and identify improved enzyme functions. With these approaches it will be possible to identify the genetic machinery involved in the breakdown of lignocellulosic plant biomass in these fungi and provide systems-level insight into the genomic basis of biomass deconstruction. Ultimately, this project will help establish design principles to engineer new fungal strains for lignocellulose deconstruction, while creating enabling genetic tools for metabolic engineering of anaerobic fungi. Planned experiments will leverage DOE genomics, molecular, and computational analysis resources at the Joint Genome Institute, the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, and the Systems Biology Knowledgebase. The knowledge gained from this project will enable predictive biology and genome engineering in anaerobic fungi, advancing BER’s mission in the development of sustainable bioenergy resources."

A well-known example is that the structural chirality of DNA participates in essential genetic functions. More interestingly, in some solid-state inorganic magnets, the structural chirality and magnetic chirality could occur simultaneously. This family of magnets are called “chiral magnets” and they are very rare in nature. Exotic physical phenomena are bound to happen in chiral magnets where all of space inversion, mirror, and time reversal symmetries are broken, since broken symmetry often accompany new physical phenomena. For instance, chiral magnets exhibit various exotic magnetic structures including the chiral topological soliton lattice and Skyrmions. The exploration of chiral magnetism and topological spin states is at the forefront in magnetism research. Chiral magnets could also open up new material functions for future technology such as the spin current diodes which utilize the chiral magnetic features of chiral magnets. However, the broken inversion symmetry does not guarantee the emergence of chiral or topological spin states in chiral magnets. A central and open question for chiral magnets is how their magnetic structures and dynamics inherit chirality from their chiral lattice structure. Neutron scattering is an ideal probe for lattice structures, magnetic structures, and magnetic dynamics. Our group at NJIT study the chiral magnetism in chiral magnets utilizing neutron scattering and advanced crystal growth techniques. Our project focuses on the study of interplay between lattice chirality and various magnetic interactions in chiral magnets. Our proposed research will reveal the physical mechanism responsible for the exotic magnetic orders and dynamics in chiral magnets, offer an innovative approach to realize topological spin states in chiral magnets, and help to identify prospective quantum materials for novel computational techniques."

Thomas III, Tufts University (Principal Investigator) Mu-Ping Nieh, University of Connecticut (Co-Investigator) Steven Wheeler, University of Georgia (Co-Investigator) Matthew Panzer, Tufts University (Co-Investigator) Semiconducting solids made of organic materials, as opposed to inorganics such as silicon, are leading candidates for emerging optoelectronic technologies, including organic light emitting devices (OLEDs), flexible electronics, photovoltaic materials, and quantum information applications. However, the nearly infinite possibilities of organic semiconducting structures, combined with the notoriously difficult problem of predicting how individual molecules will assemble in crystalline lattices, is currently preventing clear understanding of how chemical structure influences solid-state packing and the downstream optical and electronic properties. Our project addresses this problem through understanding how intentionally inserted, discrete, and directional interactions of the side chains of conjugated materials, usually relegated to only imparting solubility, can dictate optical and electronic properties of conjugated organic semiconductors through control over solid-state assembly. Our interdisciplinary team combines complementary skills to meet this overall goal: Principal Investigator Thomas (expertise in physical organic chemistry, molecular design, synthesis, crystal engineering, and optical spectroscopy) collaborates with co-investigators Nieh (solid-state characterization using scattering techniques), Wheeler (computational chemistry), and Panzer (evaluation of how structure influences electroluminescence). Building on previous work of this team, the objectives of this project are: Objective 1—Structural Versatility: Understand how different types of discrete, directional interactions of aromatic rings enable programming of molecular packing of organic optoelectronic materials. Objective 2—Material Function: Determine the extent to which this programming of molecular packing enables high-impact optoelectronic functions of organics, including phosphorescence and delayed fluorescence, which have emerged as cutting-edge approaches to OLED design, and open shell organic materials for quantum information science. This fundamental research is highly relevant to the Materials Chemistry program in Basic Energy Sciences, as it aims to improve understanding of how to design energy-relevant materials based on first principles. This project is innovative because it breaks away from the current design paradigm of organic conjugated materials that treats their pendant side-chains as ancillary solubilizing groups to be minimized, and instead harnesses them to interact directly with conjugated backbones and control their molecular packing and optoelectronic properties. The expected outcomes of this project are: 1) new understanding of how of discrete, directional interactions can control the packing and optoelectronics of organic conjugated materials, 2) new material designs that harness this approach to program high-impact functions of conjugated materials, and 3) fundamental insight of how structure influences aromatic interactions from a combination of experiment and theory. These outcomes will have wide-reaching impact for material design, with the long-term goal of “pre-programming” packing, optoelectronic properties, and function into the chemical structure of organic semiconducting materials."

Here, the project will explore the role of the formation of large-scale plasma induced flows that occur under self- organization that leads to the convection of plastic particles (micron sized) to the plasma attachment regions. This convention should lead to enhanced transport and higher depolymerization rates. Also, associated with self-organization is the emission of charged droplets in the region of plasma attachment. A key question is do these droplets contain heavily broken up polymer chains or monomers? Is this emission another approach to collection of depolymerized media? These droplets are also charged and contains particles suggesting a means to control emitted media. Currently, plastics upcycling, the conversion of plastics to higher value products, is energy intensive due to high heat requirements (for example thermolysis). Plasma-based treatment offers a greener approach to the depolymerization of plastics and offers the possibility of upcycling to make higher value products such as higher-grade plastics and fuels."

The state-of-the-art theoretical approaches developed in our group will allow us to study closely related systems that hold a great promise for light harvesting, charge separation and transport. With wealth of time-resolved experimental data, the mechanisms responsible for the charge and energy flow are only partially established and remain controversial. Our expertise in quantum dynamics and time-domain density functional theory will allow us to address the fundamental aspects of photo-excitation dynamics on the nanoscale. The proposed studies will result in a predictive fundamental framework for design of novel, efficient and cost-saving solar cells. Particular attention will be given to · Photoinduced dynamics in novel nanoscale systems for solar energy harvesting. (1) Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are highly promising for solar applications. Inexpensive, solution-processable MHPs exhibit remarkably high efficiencies. Many MHPs were synthesized and studied, however, few quantum dynamics simulations of charge and energy flow were reported, primarily from our group, even though multiple time-resolved experiments were performed. This fact provides strong motivation for the proposed atomistic time-domain studies that mimic the experiments most closely. (2) MoS2, WS2, black phosphorus, carbon nitride and related 2D systems are particularly promising for solar light utilization, since they maximize the interface required to achieve charge separation. Only a few atoms thick, they are excellent conductors of charges. Design involving 2-D systems can result in portable and efficient solar cells. We will emphasize the novel (hot carrier extraction, Auger vs phonon driven processes) and realistic (defects, chemical interactions) aspects of these systems. · Tuning nanoscale interfaces for efficient charge and energy flow. (1) How can efficient charge separation be achieved at weakly coupled interfaces? Experiments show both ultrafast charge and energy transfer, and bottlenecks. Having investigated several ideal systems, we propose to study the realistic aspects of such interfaces that are important for solar cell design. (2) Can one tune interfacial dynamics by surface termination, insertion layers and other synthetically feasible means? Advances in computational methodologies and hardware allow us to study larger systems and consider system variations associated with different surface terminations and doping, approaching the experimental reality more closely. Focusing on topical materials and interesting observations we will investigate how to optimize desired pathways and minimize charge and energy losses. · Advanced principles and methods for enhancement of light harvesting and utilization (1) Prior to relaxing, hot carriers can perform many useful functions: enhance charge transport in MHPs, facilitate chemistries not accessible with cold carriers, and allow one to use metallic systems, such as graphene and plasmonic nanoparticles, in place of semiconductors to harvest light. We will investigate how hot electrons can be steered towards productive processes. (2) Auger processes are ubiquitous in nanoscale systems due to quantum confinement, which brings carriers closer together, thereby enhancing Coulomb interactions. Our group has developed novel techniques for simulating Auger processes in nanoscale materials in the time domain, at the atomistic level, and in competition with phonon-driven processes, allowing us now to study such phenomena. (3) Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a useful tool for analyzing large amounts of data and accelerating simulations. Quantum dynamics of complex systems constitutes an excellent candidate for applications of ML analysis, because of the multitude of factors involved, including composition, thermodynamic phase, defects, geometric and electronic structure, temperature, atomic motions, electron-phonon coupling, quantum coherence, etc. We propose to use ML in order to analyze simulation data, and to run longer trajectories and sample rare events using ML force-fields."

(213) 740-2394 The fundamental process of electron transfer (ET) within and between molecules dictates all biological energy conversion strategies, including respiration and photosynthesis. This project seeks a comprehensive physics-based understanding of the mechanisms and limits of redox networks that mediate and regulate electron transport through microbial metabolic pathways, with special emphasis on environmental microbes that perform extracellular electron transport (EET) from/to electrodes or participate in syntrophic interspecies electron exchange with other microbes. By performing redox conduction over micrometer length scales and beyond, these organisms are challenging our state of knowledge about biological electron transfer, currently largely limited to coherent tunneling processes that link nanometer-spaced reduction-oxidation partners. In fact, with the discovery of bacterial nanowires, conductive biofilms, methanotrophic consortia, and multicellular bacterial cables, the length scales of microbial ET observations have jumped by 7 orders of magnitude, from nanometers to centimeters, during the last decade alone! Our mechanistic understanding, however, has not yet caught up with these surprising findings. Bridging this knowledge gap is the central theme of our work. On the biotic/abiotic EET front, our focus is on metal-reducers and oxidizers, which can acquire energy by EET to/from redox-active surfaces. Such microbes may be used as biocatalysts on electrodes for converting the energy stored in diverse chemical fuels to electricity, or vice versa (microbial electrosynthesis), in renewable energy technologies. On the interspecies electron exchange front, we will turn our attention to one of the most important metabolic interactions in nature: consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and sulfate reducing bacteria. The objectives below build on our recent success in measuring long-distance redox conduction in microbial multiheme cytochrome networks in situ along living cells, mapping their distribution on bacterial nanowires, development of cell-free systems for studying redox conduction, calculating redox hopping and diffusion-assisted hopping with stochastic approaches, and expanding our knowledgebase of EET from outward to inward EET (electrode-to-cell). Our renewal activities will result in a physics-based understanding of the role of cytochrome electron conduits in both EET and interspecies electron exchange, by accomplishing the following objectives: I. Observe and quantify the diffusive dynamics of the outer-membrane multiheme cytochromes MtrC and OmcA through in vivo single molecule tracking on Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 cell surfaces and along membrane nanowires. The results of these measurements will directly test the hypothesis that protein dynamics facilitate a collision-exchange mechanism of inter-protein electron transport over micrometer length scales. Measurements will inform and be informed by simulations of this diffusion-assisted hopping mechanism. II. Electrochemically characterize the outer-membrane porin-cytochrome Cyc2 from the chemolithotrophic Fe(II)-oxidizer Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1 as a model conduit of inward EET. Our studies will benefit from the recently demonstrated heterologous expression of this protein in E. coli, and our development of a combined microscopic/electrochemical technique to capture the bioenergetic impact of inward EET on cells. The overarching goal is to shed light on cathode-microbe EET, which remains poorly understood relative to its microbe-anode counterpart. III. Develop solid-state physics and electrochemical techniques to measure direct inter-species electron transport in anaerobic oxidation of methane consortia where multiheme cytochromes are hypothesized to link methanotrophic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria. While genomic and transcriptomic approaches point to the role of multiheme cytochromes in directly mediating this interaction, direct physical and electrochemical measurements have never been demonstrated in this challenging system."

Predicted by Albert Einstein more than a century ago, the detection of gravitational waves demanded the construction of exquisitely sensitive instruments. Indeed, it took nearly four decades for the LIGO-Virgo collaboration to “listen” to these feeble ripples in space-time. In contrast to the detection of gravitational waves from black-hole mergers, the merger of two neutron stars is accompanied by the detection of electromagnetic counterparts in the form of an intense gamma ray burst as well as a long-term afterglow that is powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements that are forged during such cataclysmic event. In this way, the binary neutron star merger GW170817 is providing fundamental new insights into the synthesis of heavy elements in the cosmos and on the nature of dense matter. The main goal of this proposal is to combine laboratory experiments, electromagnetic observations, and gravitational-wave detections to elucidate the physics behind the equation of state of neutron-rich matter, the sole ingredient that prevents the gravitational collapse of neutron stars into black holes. The scope of the proposed work spans more than 55 orders of magnitude in baryon number and seeks new insights into the basic nature of subatomic matter. The theoretical tools devoted to this proposal include state of the art modeling that, while informed by experiment, aim to describe the structure and dynamics of exotic systems beyond the experimental reach. Of primary interest to this proposal are neutron-rich systems that will be created at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams as well as neutron stars that will be probed with increasingly sensitive telescopes and gravitational-wave observatories. And when required “to boldly go where no one has gone before,” we will rely on machine learning techniques, particularly artificial neural networks, to provide predictions with quantifiable theoretical uncertainties. Instrumental to this activity will be the training and mentoring of the next generation of young scientists. We are confident that at least three PhDs will be produced from this research. Moreover, the science goals are anchored in some of the overarching questions articulated by the nuclear community in its most recent 2015 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science. In particular, the proposed research is of direct relevance to the following fundamental questions: (i) What is the nature of the nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons into stable nuclei and rare isotopes? (ii) What is the nature of neutron stars and dense nuclear matter? (iii) How were the heavy elements from iron to uranium made?"
Time-dependent density-functional approaches for spin-dependent nonequilibrium phenomena,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019109,"Ullrich, Carsten",Carsten.Ullrich@thecuratorsoftheuniversityofmissouri,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","The objective of this research is to develop new theoretical and computational approaches for spin-dependent nonequilibrium phenomena in quantum materials, and apply these methods in the linear-response regime and in the real-time nonlinear regime. This work is motivated by a growing interest in noncollinear magnetism in systems of interacting electrons, occurring in the ground state (e.g., in frustrated magnetic systems or skyrmions), during spin-wave excitations, or driven by strong, ultrafast fields; spin-orbit coupling often plays a prominent role. The standard density-functional approaches for noncollinear magnetism, the local spin-density and generalized gradient approximations, use exchange-correlation (xc) functionals based on the collinear spin-polarized electron gas and assume a local spin quantization axis. As a result, these approximations do not produce any xc magnetic torques, which are important for the proper description of magnetization dynamics. We propose to develop a new class of xc functionals for noncollinear magnetism by generalizing the local Slater exchange and the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj&ouml;lander (STLS) method for the case of general mixed two-component spinor wave functions. From the STLS local field factor, we reverse-engineer an xc potential. Both Slater and STLS are orbital functionals, and therefore not tied to a specific reference system: they are applicable not just to Fermi electrons, but also to model Hamiltonians, such as Dirac electrons in graphene or Hubbard-type lattice models. In addition, they give rise to xc magnetic fields with components transverse to the magnetization, and hence produce xc magnetic torques. We will test and apply these new functionals for the following situations: 1. Spin waves in 2D materials. We will extend our prior work, where we studied 2D electron gases in semiconductors in the presence of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, and discovered that the local spin-density approximation causes significant errors in the spin-wave stiffness. We will calculate spin-wave dispersions with noncollinear Slater and STLS and compare with experimental data from inelastic light scattering. We will also study spin waves in graphene and related materials (silicene, stanene) in the presence of spin-orbit coupling due to adatoms. 2. Strongly driven Hubbard dimers. We will solve the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation for two electrons on a two-point Hubbard lattice driven by noncollinear magnetic fields, testing the Slater and STLS xc magnetic fields by comparison with exact xc magnetic fields, constructed from the solution of the two-body Schr&ouml;dinger equation. This will be the first exact benchmark assessment of xc magnetic torques in strongly nonequilibrium spin dynamics. 3. Ab initio noncollinear spin dynamics. We will implement our new xc functionals for noncollinear magnetism in the open source codes Abinit and Octopus. We will calculate the magnetization of typical noncollinear materials such as lattices of Cr atoms that have been studied in the literature. With Octopus, we will simulate the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of small Fe or Cr clusters and of magnetic molecules, in particular graphene fragments. The proposed research will have fundamental and practical impact. The new xc functionals will be applicable to noncollinear magnetic phenomena in a broad spectrum of materials in and out of equilibrium. Our work will point to new ways of controlling spin waves in low-dimensional systems, and ultrafast manipulation of magnetization on the nanoscale; this could lead to novel applications in data storage and processing and in the design of ultrafast spintronics devices."

Such studies are essential to build a deeper understanding of combustion, atmospheric, and interstellar environments, and to permit reliable extrapolation of measured quantities from associated conditions of temperature and pressure to extreme conditions where measurements are not feasible. These investigations are conducted using state-of-the-art molecular beam machines in conjunction with DC slice velocity map ion imaging and other advanced spectroscopic techniques to study frontier areas in chemical dynamics. Studies include bimolecular reactions of polyatomic molecules with atomic and molecular radicals performed under single collision conditions; and time-resolved investigations of photodissociation and unimolecular decomposition. A notable aspect of this effort is the close interplay with theoretical investigations of the structure and dynamics of the systems of interest, either performed in-house or in collaboration with theory colleagues, to develop a molecular-level understanding of chemical phenomena. The overall objectives of our program are: to extend the range of powerful dynamics studies to more complex polyatomic systems; to reveal thereby novel aspects of dynamics that arise with increasing molecular complexity; to identify novel reaction pathways such as roaming dynamics and roaming-mediated reaction and characterize them in full detail; and to benchmark a range of theoretical methods. Two experimental avenues are pursued in the proposed studies building on current progress: Crossed-beam slice velocity map imaging studies of radical reactions with polyatomic targets, and development of the capability for time-resolved structural dynamics in molecules using Coulomb Explosion Imaging (CEI) and relativistic electron diffraction at the UED facility at the Linac Coherent Light Source. The crossed-beam studies directly yield the velocity-flux contour maps for the reactions that, in combination with high-level theoretical calculations, provide deep insight into reaction pathways and dynamics, the existence of barriers and intermediate reaction complexes, and highlight systematic trends in mechanisms and energy and angular momentum partitioning as a function of target structure. Proposed systems of interest include OH radical reactions with alcohols and alkenes, H atom reactions with polyatomic targets, and coformer-dependent reactivity for simple alkanes. In the time-resolved studies we are pursuing both CEI in a femtosecond pump- probe configuration using 3D (time-and-position) imaging combined with covariance mapping analysis, and ultrafast electron diffraction, to reveal nuclear dynamics in real time. Proposed systems of interest here include oxalyl chloride, a novel case in which four product fragments are seen following UV excitation, and 1,2-diiodobenzene, which can eliminate iodine atoms sequentially or in a concerted fashion giving ortho-benzyne as a product. The latter will be studied both using CEI and electron diffraction, and contrasted with the dynamics for 1,4-diiodobenzene, to reveal the distinct capabilities of each experimental approach."

Our knowledge of the baryon spectrum has rapidly evolved, due largely to the refinement of dynamical and phenomenological coupled-channel approaches for the analysis of pseudoscalar-meson photoproduction reactions. These analyses have been extended to the electroproduction process, withpN, and?Nfinal states analyzed simultaneously for the first time. A further extension to?Kfinal states will be carried out. These results will be used to determine the dependence of resonance couplings on the photon virtuality, providing a link between perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and the energy region where quark confinement sets in. This analysis will provide a point of comparison for lattice QCD, chiral-unitary, dynamical-quark, and phenomenological approaches to experiment. Also, systematic uncertainties and model dependence in specific parameterizations will be studied, matching to low-energy constraints will be performed, and extensions of the analysis to higher photon virtualities and energies will be carried out, in response to upcoming experiments at Jefferson Lab and other institutions. Interactions between George Washington researchers and outside experimental and theoretical efforts are frequent. In numerous collaborations, both preliminary and final datasets have been fitted for experimental groups studying a wide range of meson, nucleon, and photon scattering reactions. Over the upcoming grant period, we will continue interacting closely with groups providing new and existing meson-electroproduction measurements, mainly from the evolving Jefferson Lab experimental program. These data, and the associated fits, will be made available through an interactive website which has been patterned after the SAID (Scattering Analysis Interactive Database) facility for use by the community. In addition, the resulting amplitudes can be further analyzed to separate out the contributions of resonance states. This will advance an NSAC goal to develop techniques for conducting a global data analysis in order to augment our experimental knowledge of the hadron spectrum. Properties of these resonances are evaluated and updated yearly by the Particle Data Group, in which the principal investigator plays a major role."
A Practical Niobium-Tin Cavity for the ATLAS Superconducting Linac,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0021618,"Kutsaev, Sergey","Sergey.Kutsaev@radiabeamtechnologies,llc.","['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Development of Practical Niobium-Tin Cavities for Ion Linacs Michael Kelly, Argonne National Laboratory (Principal Investigator) Sam Posen, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Co-Investigator) Sergey Kutsaev, RadiaBeam (Co-Investigator) We propose a foundationally new approach to the design, fabrication and operation of ion linear accelerators. The combination of low RF-loss Nb3Sn superconducting cavities by vapor diffusion with stand-alone cryocooler-based modules provides a practical way to move beyond incremental improvements and enable ion accelerators that are several times smaller, cheaper and less complex than today’s niobium-based machines, but with similar overall capabilities in terms of gradient and beam power. The transformative aspect and fundamentally enabling technology is the use of Nb 3 Sn with low-beta cavities. This proposal distinguishes itself from previous Nb3Sn work, as the successful cavities would be used immediately in the proposed Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) Multi-user Upgrade (MUU) in place of ‘baseline’ niobium cavities. The implications of successful Nb 3 Sn as a superconductor for low-beta cavities are profound and different than for elliptical cavities. For elliptical cavities in velocity-of-light applications, the promised reduction of the intrinsic surface resistance would enable operation at 4.5 K rather than 2 K, certainly a cost advantage in terms of cryogenics. Ultimately, the high superheating field for Nb 3 Sn may also enable higher gradients for large machines such as for a future high-energy collider. Here, we aim to transform low-beta accelerators by reducing intrinsic losses in quarter-wave cavities to negligible values at 4.5 K and even as we increase the cavity frequency by a factor of two as compared to typical low-beta cavities. One impact will be to eliminate the need for connection to a large helium cryoplant, especially for small to moderate sized machines where the overhead for cryogenics is costly. Separately, the size reduction by itself is transformative, as nearly every contribution to an ion linac’s cost scales more quickly than the linear dimension of the cavity. For example, per accelerating volt, we aim to reduce the size and weight of the cavities and by four times, the RF power requirements for microphonic dominated machines like ATLAS also by a factor of four and the helium cooling and annual helium consumption requirements by three times. ATLAS is the Department of Energy (DOE) accelerator facility for low-energy nuclear physics research. The vision is to evolve the capabilities of the ATLAS to provide high-intensity stable ion beams, and unique radioactive beams, alongside FRIB. One key to realizing this vision is the development of multi-user capabilities to allow simultaneous measurements in different experimental areas using, for example, one stable beam and one radioactive beam. A new two-cavity cryomodule based on Nb 3 Sn cavities would be an important component of the ATLAS Multi-user Upgrade, providing independent beam energy adjustment to a second target area and greatly enhancing usability of that area. Beyond ATLAS, this work could have tremendous benefit for a future light-ion injector for FRIB, allowing cost effective, simultaneous production of isotopes at two different targets by beam fragmentation and isotope separation on-line (ISOL). National facilities, such as a dedicated U.S. accelerator-based isotope production facility using, for example, superconducting ion and electron linacs could be constructed at reduced cost and, notably, without a large central cryoplant."

Silberstein, Cornell University Electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices such as batteries and fuel cells function by creating a difference in electrical across two electrodes that drive electron flow through a circuit to power devices. The polymer membrane that separates these electrodes is critical for controlling ion transport and must be mechanically robust. The objectives of this planned research are to discover the fundamental physical mechanisms for self-regulation of synthetic polymers and gels under electric fields. Biological membranes are constantly assessing evolving conditions such as electric field and optimizing their function by dynamically adjusting their properties. In contrast the current generation of polymer membranes are static and unable to readily adjust to changing operating conditions making them less durable and vulnerable to performance degradation. This in turn has adverse consequences for device operation and sometimes even for safe use. Membrane performance and durability can be dramatically improved by imbuing the polymer membrane with the ability to sense and adapt to the local electrochemical environment, similar to what is possible in biological membranes. Enabled by the emerging approaches for tailoring polymers through modulating the mechanical strength of particular bonds, this unexplored concept will be pursued computationally through simulations that explicitly represent the atomic structure of the material and development of theories that describe the overall material behavior. The findings will then be experimentally proven by making and characterizing polymers with mechanical and self-healing properties that should be dynamically tunable by electric fields. This work will open up a new concept in design of polymer membranes that predictably self-regulate internal bonding dynamics and interactions in response to changes in external electrical fields to tune instantaneous mechanical properties such as stiffness and strength, paving the way for safer and more durable electrochemical energy devices."
Multiscale Modeling of the Mechanical Behavior of Damage-Tolerant Fusion Materials,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0018410,"Marian, Jaime","Jaime.Marian@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,losangeles","['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Multiscale Modeling of the Mechanical Behavior of Damage-Tolerant Fusion Materials Jaime Marian (PI) and Nasr Ghoniem (Co-PI) University of California Los Angeles PUBLIC ABSTRACT Neutron and energetic plasma radiation, combined with a high heat flux emanating from a burn- ing plasma and intercepted by structural components in a fusion reactor (First Wall - FW, and Divertor - D) result in a complex state of thermomechanical and radiation damage. Accumulation of such damage leads to reduced reliability and premature failure of these structural components. The objective of the present research is to develop experimentally-validated multiscale models of the mechanical behavior of materials used in the D& FW components under the concurrent as- sault of radiation and thermal energy. Our new methodology of coupled multi-physics-multiscale will continue to be applied to the optimization of the D/FW components of a Compact Fusion Power Plant (CFPP). A new modeling strategy will be developed, where computer simulations of microstructure evolution will be coupled for the first time with in-situ mechanical deformation (plasticity and fracture). This modeling approach will be applied to tungsten (W) and to refrac- tory high-entropy alloys so as to aid in their development as radiation-resistant materials. We will also develop computational simulations for the motion, agglomeration, and retention of plasma- produced gases (hydrogen isotopes and helium) in W. Finally, a new class of micro-engineered materials composed of flexible W-foam will continue to be developed and modeled so as to improve their resistance to sputtering erosion and thermomechanical fatigue during plasma transients. The concurrent effects of neutron radiation, thermal damage, and mechanical stress on failure phenomena of fusion materials and components remain largely unexplored. The main objective of this proposal is to address this issue, explore the physical mechanisms that contribute to radiation and thermal damage, and propose solutions that will enable future development of radiation- and thermal-damage resistant materials. Unlike empirical approaches, we propose to develop a science-based methodology that enables a clear connection between the microscopic state of the material and its functional requirements. Rather than a bottoms-up approach, we propose to develop a realistic top-down multiscale modeling set of tools that are experimentally-validated at the macroscopic scale in the High Energy Flux Testing facility (HEFTY) at UCLA. The focus of the effort will be on understanding the science of damage accumulation under pulsed radiation/ high-heat-flux conditions that are anticipated in fusion energy power plants. A multi-scale design framework will be developed, where we connect the mechanical design of fusion components, with detailed micro-scale models of radiation damage, plasticity, and crack nucleation & growth. The operating environment in a fusion power plant represents one of the greatest engineering challenges of all time. Structural materials must function with great reliability in the harsh con- ditions of extreme heat flux, energetic plasma bombardment and penetrating neutron radiation. We propose to develop here a multi-scale description of the physics of coupled radiation damage, plastic deformation, and fracture under the unsteady (pulsed) operational conditions of fusion en- ergy. The second aspect of our effort will focus on understanding the mechanisms of accumulation of hydrogen and helium gas isotopes in plasma-facing materials, and on how to micro-engineer such materials so as to mitigate plasma erosion and radioactive tritium retention. We will validate these models with plasma exposure and high heat flux transients with simultaneous mechanical loading. The research is expected to enable the design of radiation and thermal-resistant materials and structures for fusion energy."

This economic constriction puts immense pressure on our rural small landholders to increase economic output per acre. Solar power at small and medium scales must be deployable and not interfere with agricultural production. By developing a price competitive solar racking system, landowners have greater economic stability from multiple income sources while reducing energy price volatility risks. The proposed solution is to design a simple and flexible solar power racking system that spans irrigation canals in an affordable cost-competitive way. The proposed system leverages pre-owned and already utilized land, provides benefits of lowering evaporation, increased solar cell efficiency, along with making use of pre-existing access roads usually along canals. The approach is to employ new technologies in adaptive structural design as a way of finding the absolute lightest, strongest, and cheapest structural solution. By having an installer and consumer-friendly design that is robust yet light and cheap, the system can easily be installed in mass quantities over irrigation canals all across the Midwest and western states. Our Phase-1 research outcome was an adaptive structural and solar design that optimally conforms to any canal site and orientation. This design methodology is enhanced with Artificial Intelligence optimization which chooses from thousands of possible design configurations, the most economical final design possible for the client and site. This process folds in structural, energy, and comprehensive pricing calculations, in addition to a life-cycle cost projection. Our Phase-2 project will be to build our first full-scale prototype which will be used to measure any water evaporation and water quality improvements, measure a boost to solar panel production which operate at cooler temperatures, and closely refine the construction assembly process to ensure a fast, safe, and affordable structural product. We will also be conducting a canal impact survey to test and produce new safety compliant procedures for operating canals with solar structures overhead.Development of this system will provide many benefits when adopted in the marketplace. Some of these benefits include; creation of clean energy jobs in rural areas, reinvestment in rural infrastructure systems, water evaporation reduced with less mineralization and fouling of farmlands, stabilization of energy prices, land conservation, reduction of heat-island effects, and reduced water pumping costs to farmers and communities."

At present, many of the models used to understand or improve these systems include unrealistic over-simplified chemistry, and are not very accurate. The long-term goal of this project is to make it possible for scientists and engineers to quickly and quantitatively construct high-fidelity computer models for these reactive systems from first principles. These can be used to generate computer simulations that would facilitate scientific understanding, better optimization of engineered systems, and improved design of new systems. This project directly addresses BES&rsquo;s Fundamental Research Theme of understanding Reactivity in Diverse Environments, and the Thrust Area of Chemical Reactivity. Historically, it has usually been too difficult to predict the many reactions occurring in complicated systems far from equilibrium, so instead one typically observes the system experimentally, and then tries to assemble a model consistent with the observations. Since the number of measured experimental data is typically insufficient to determine all the rate parameters from the data, researchers have often resorted to using oversimplified models, which are frequently too inaccurate to be useful. Even when the accuracy is sufficient, so the historical approach &ldquo;works&rdquo;, it can be quite time-consuming and expensive, since it requires significant experimental work from the outset. The time and cost required are significant impediments to scientific progress and slow the pace of technological innovation. This project is aimed at transforming the way complex chemical systems are treated, by advancing the nascent capability to reliably predict the behavior of reacting mixtures from first principles. The project has the potential to both accelerate our development of accurate models for important non-equilibrium systems, and to provide a better scientific framework for addressing these systems. This project focuses on two key issues: (1) developing better computer methods for handling the complexity of the reactions and reaction networks (2) computing the properties of reactions and reactive intermediates which have never been studied in detail before, so we can accurately predict a broader range of systems. Our main focus during this grant period will be systems involving heavily unsaturated organics (e.g. leading to formation of health-harming polycyclic aromatics and soot) and/or the heteroatoms nitrogen and sulfur (which appear in almost all fuel and chemical feedstocks including biomass, in atmospheric pollutants, and also in most batteries, fuel cells, and pharmaceuticals). To accurately and efficiently model these systems we will develop a quantitative understanding of several types of reactions, intermediates, and functional groups, which have not been studied in sufficient detail to allow accurate kinetic modeling, and encode that understanding into the Reaction Mechanism Generator software suite. The rate parameter estimates and overall predictions of the kinetic models will be validated versus experimental data, mostly from the literature but also some data measured in our laboratory using flash photolysis with laser and mass spec detection."

These elementary reactions lead to three prototype aromatic molecules in the gas phase under single collision conditions at the most fundamental, microscopic level: monocyclic aromatics (benzene, C6H6), bicyclic aromatics carrying two six-membered rings (naphthalene; C10H8), and bicyclic aromatics carrying one six- and one five-membered ring (indene; C9H8). The molecular mass growth processes to these aromatics represent a fundamental unsolved challenge and are of vital importance to the gas phase reaction dynamics community to eventually understand the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their hydrogen deficient precursors from the ‘bottom up’. Planar PAHs such as coronene necessitate six-membered rings as present in benzene and naphthalene; non-planar PAHs like corannulene and fullerenes require five-membered rings existing in indene to ‘bend’ planar structures out of the plane. This classifies benzene, naphthalene, and indene as fundamental molecular building blocks to complex PAHs. The intimate knowledge of the elementary mechanisms to synthesize these aromatics is therefore critical to our understanding of the early stage chemistry in combustion systems how PAHs and ultimately soot forms. However, the elementary steps, reaction dynamics, energy flow processes, and mechanisms to form even these chemically simplest building blocks (benzene, naphthalene, indene) on the molecular level are still highly debated as synthetic routes have not been investigated comprehensively under single collision conditions to date. Our studies focus on three key systems: First, we expose the reaction dynamics of benchmark RSFRs (1-butene-3-yne-2-yl, 1,3-butadienyl-2) along with prototype ‘aliphatic’ (methylidyne) and ‘olefinic’ (vinyl) radicals with C2 to C5 hydrocarbons (acetylene, ethylene, vinylacetylene, cyclopentadiene) accessing the C6H7 PES. These experiments unravel the synthesis of benzene (C6H6) – the fundamental molecular building block of PAHs - along with its acyclic isomers. Second, we untangle the collision energy dependent reaction dynamics of prototype RSFRs (propargyl, cyclopropadienyl) with C4 and C6 hydrocarbons (vinylacetylene, benzene) accessing the C9H9 PES. These crossed beam experiments explore the synthesis of indene (C9H8) – the simplest aro- matic representative carrying one six- and one five-membered ring - together with distinct structural isomers. Finally, we reveal the reaction dynamics of the RSFR 1-butene-3-yne-2-yl together with prototype ‘aliphatic’ (methylidyne) and acetylenic (ethynyl) radicals with strategically chosen C6 to C9 hydro- carbons (benzene, styrene, indene) accessing the C10H9 PES. These studies expose bimolecular reactions to naphthalene (C10H8) - the simplest PAH carrying two six-membered rings - and its isomers. To achieve these goals, we conduct state-of-the-art crossed molecular beam experiments over a wide range of collision energies from 10 to 100 kJmol-1 in a hydrocarbon-free, crossed molecular beam machine with ultra-sensitive detection schemes coupled to a universal and rotatable angular resolved time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector with soft and hard electron impact ionization and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) detection. Although crossed molecular beam experiments have been employed for almost five decades, there is a critical lack of understanding on the elementary mechanisms how to synthesize fundamental molecular building blocks carrying six- (benzene, naphthalene) and five-membered rings (indene) due to the previously insurmountable difficulties in preparing supersonic molecular beams of radical reactants of a sufficient high intensity to detect the reaction products under single collision conditions. Considering the high reactivity of the open shell reactants, crossed molecular beam experiments, in which the reactants are prepared in separate side chambers, present a logical experimental approach. The results of the scattering experiments are combined with ab initio calculations (Mebel) and flame modeling (Green). This approach not only resolves a decade old enigma of how the three simplest aromatic building blocks are formed in combustion settings, but also how these elementary reactions drive molecular mass growth processes via two- (flat) and three-dimensional (bowl-shaped) aromatic nanostructures ultimately to soot."

Since the discovery of quarks, nuclear physicists have been trying to understand the relation between the lower- resolution description of nuclei using protons and neutrons (nucleons), and its underlying higher-resolution description in terms of quarks and gluons. At the intersection of these two paradigms are Short-Ranged Correlations (SRC): pairs of strongly interacting nucleons whose separation is comparable to their radii.

Further adding to the threat of water contamination are processes which mobilize toxic metals naturally occurring or from mining derived sediments. Legacy mining and ore processing throughout the Colorado River Basin, for example, has led to a host of floodplains with persistent uranium plumes. Whether of natural or anthropogenic origin, the fate and transport of metal contaminants in soils and sediments is controlled by a complex network of biogeochemical reactions coupled with hydrologic processes. Determining the biogeochemical controls on metals dispersal and bioavailability within sedimentary basins, especially active floodplains, are particularly important given their prominence as groundwater sources, conduits between surface and groundwater, and vulnerability to environmental perturbations. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) has a major but poorly understood control over the mobility of metals in surface and subsurface systems. Variations in the chemical composition of DOM across watersheds, owing to divergent organic matter transformation pathways, have potentially important influences on metal mobility. An outcome that has largely remained unexplored, but which may have critical impacts on dissolved metal concentrations and associated migration, is variation in the functional composition of DOM. We posit that the functionality of DOM is affected by hydrologically driven redox conditions, and that these differences have a strong and direct impact on dissolved metal concentrations and associated migration. The overarching goal of our project is to determine the effect of redox conditions resulting from differing hydrologic environments on formation and transport of soluble metal-organic complexes. Presently, there is no systematic understanding of how redox conditions control organic ligand composition, representing a significant hurdle towards accurately predicting metal mobilization in surface and subsurface systems. Accordingly, we propose a multifaceted study that will elucidate variations in DOM functional groups arising from different redox conditions across a series of field sites. We will utilize advanced analytical approaches for determining both the DOM ligand sites and metal-ligand complexes, and we will pair the field measurements with laboratory experiments to determine the stability and exchange rates of the metal-ligand complexes. Our work will address the following questions: Do redox conditions affect speciation and concentration of metal-binding functional groups in dissolved organic matter? How do differences in speciation and abundance of functional groups affect metal binding across redox environments? What are the kinetics of association/dissociation of metal-organic complexes as sediments/soils shift between anoxic and oxic states? Our proposed work will advance a process-based understanding of metal fate and transport within watersheds, focusing principally on the dynamic hydrologic states of floodplains and sedimentary basins in general. Our efforts will directly complement SBR Science Focus Areas by providing a unified framework for evaluating the effect of redox transitions on micronutrient and contaminant metal solubility, leveraging the Columbia River, East River and Savannah River watersheds as experimental testbeds. We will pair our field and laboratory activities with state-of-the-art analyses that utilize DOE-operated facilities, including synchrotron light sources and the Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Moreover, our work will directly advance the SBR programs goal of developing a robust predictive understanding of how hydrologic changes in watersheds affect water quality and inorganic element/contaminant loading."

However, decades of field and laboratory studies at small scales (1&rsquo;s to 10&rsquo;s of meters) have not yielded predictive power at the scales of resource management (100&rsquo;s to 1000&rsquo;s of meters). The need for prediction of river corridor exchange is underscored by the proposed Clean Water Rule, which clarifies that river corridors are to be regulated as part of the Clean Water Act. Thus, there is a need to understand how we can accurately predict river corridor exchange across entire river networks, and how these predictions can be incorporated with earth system models. Taking a well-studied headwater catchment as a study site, the proposed research will achieve two primary objectives. First, we will prototype a multi-scale experimental framework linking transport and transformation at scales ranging from less than 1-m to 100&rsquo;s of meters. Next, we will apply a range of models of increasing complexity to determine the minimum information requirements to accurately represent river corridor exchange in earth system models. Ultimately we propose to develop experimental and modeling approaches that: (1) extend predictive understanding of river corridor exchange to the river network scale; (2) account for dynamic responses to storm events and seasonal patterns; and (3) provide predictive capacity that is applicable across a range of sites and does not require extensive field characterization. Without these advances, accurate simulation of exchange in the river corridor at the scale of river basins will remain impossible. This research will demonstrate a method to develop reduced-complexity models based on improved understanding of river corridor exchange as a function of readily observable characteristics of geologic setting and hydrologic forcing. The models we develop will have direct application to predicting the retention and downstream propagation of contaminants and thus the potential for human exposure. Results will inform management and restoration of river corridors as holistic, integrated units with surface waters intimately connected to their landscapes and will inform the next generation of Earth System Models."

CABBI is comprised of 21 institutions, led by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and is organized around three interconnected themes, which align with the DOE priority research areas of Sustainability, Feedstock Production, and Conversion. CABBI addresses the following long-term goals: 1) Provide an integrated economic and environmental framework for determining feedstock supply and its sustainability; 2) Provide a regionally adaptive yet national-scale platform for grass-based biorefining based on high yieldi feedstocks with improved environmental resilience; 3) Provide a broad set of platform microorganisms, and automated tools to engineer them, to produce value-added products from plant-produced feedstocks or substrates. The economic and ecological sustainability of the entire production system is guided and evaluated by integrated models for techno-economic assessment (TEA) and life-cycle analysis (LCA) informed by measurements of agroecosystem function. Following a vision of “plants as factories,” biofuels, bioproducts, and foundation molecules are synthesized directly in highly productive, resilient and sustainable C4 grass feedstocks. Plant-derived oils and sugars are upgraded to higher-value platform compounds by highly engineered non-model yeasts. CABBI’s approach takes advantage of our team’s expertise in ecosystem ecology and agricultural economics, plant and microbial engineering, genomics, and computational biology. It leverages key facilities: Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology; Illinois Energy Farm; SoyFACE: the Integrative Bioprocessing Research Laboratory pilot plant; and the Illinois Biological Foundry for Advanced Biomanufacturing (iBioFAB). CABBI’s partner institutions contribute facilities for plant transformation, field trials, computation, and diverse molecular, chemical, and physiological analyses. CABBI research will substantially advance understanding of: • ecosystem carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling of agroecosystems and representation of that knowledge in models to predict the productivity and sustainability of feedstock production across diverse environments and under climate change; • multiscale, spatially explicit models integrating information on ecosystem function and land availability for bioenergy production as well as refinery-scale TEA and LCA so that we may predict paths to meet demand for bioenergy and bioproducts under different climate, market, and policy scenarios; • C4 grass genomes and methods to more efficiently manipulate them through breeding and biotechnology for crop improvement; • the genetics, biochemistry, and physiology requisite to engineer high-value bioproduct synthesis, abiotic stress tolerance, and resource use efficiency in feedstock crops; • machine learning and automation to accelerate the DBTL cycle and design novel enzymatic functions; and • the genetic and physiological constraints that limit production of high-value compounds by non-model yeasts with distinct native metabolism. In summary, CABBI will deliver resilient, highly productive grasses containing large amounts of lipids and targeted to rainfed marginal lands, along with microbial conversion technologies to produce high-value platform chemicals from plant biomass, and demonstrate their economic and environmental viability."
Enhancing Entanglement: Non-Markovian and Floquet Reservoir Engineering in Many-Qubit Superconducting Quantum Circuits,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020152,"Painter, Oskar",Oskar.Painter@californiainstituteoftechnology,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Quantum information science is by now a diverse field, with many different systems of interest, and a variety of target applications. There is a common theme however to almost all work in this area: one needs robust methods for both preparing and stabilizing non- trivial, entangled quantum states. An extremely attractive approach to this general problem is dissipation engineering: through driving and system design, tailor the dissipative evolution of a quantum system so that this dynamics relaxes it to the state (or state space) of interest. Such methods are inherently robust, and have been successfully implemented in a variety of physical platforms. Despite these successes, the full power of dissipation engineering has not been explored theoretically or experimentally. First, previous work has almost exclusively focused on regimes where the dissipative dynamics is Markovian, or local in time. Second, the use of explicitly time- dependent dissipative couplings and modulated dissipation (i.e. akin to Floquet engineering) has not been explored in the context of dissipation engineering. Our broad vision is that extending reservoir engineering to incorporate these non-trivial elements will enable a transformative new class of dissipative quantum state stabilization protocols. This will allow us to transcend the limitations of current approaches. These extensions represent a fundamentally new theoretical paradigm; moreover, they are regimes that can be directly probed in the superconducting quantum circuit (SQC) architecture we will develop and study in this proposed program. Our team, consisting of lead PI Painter on the experimental side and PI Clerk on the theoretical side, has extensive experience working together. Specific research goals of the team will be to develop new theoretical tools and methodologies to describe non-Markovian and time-dependent engineered dissipation, and to use these to devise new entanglement generation and stabilization protocols in many-qubit quantum systems. We propose to experimentally implement these ideas in a many-qubit waveguide circuit QED platform recently developed by PI Painter. General scientific questions of interest include: (i) How do non-local temporal and spatial correlations in the external reservoir manifest themselves in the system dynamics? How can we use system degrees of freedom as a quantum probe of these correlations? (ii) How are the concepts of information flow, entanglement production and propagation impacted by non-Markovianity? Can these be harnessed as resources? (iii) What are optimal methods of external control that enable the reservoir to steer the quantum dynamics of the target system and ultimately stabilize non-trivial states? (iv) Are there effective (approximate), simple methods for describing the system dynamics, or dynamics within a sub-manifold of the system? In addition to fundamental science inquiry and exploration, our proposed research activities will also lead to new, more powerful theoretical techniques and hardware for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. The work proposed here will lead to new methods for entanglement creation and control, and thus specifically addresses PRO 2 (Enhance Creation and Control of Coherence) in the BES Roundtable report; it also addresses topic 4 of PRO 4 (entanglement and many-body physics)."
Diffuse Neutron Scattering Studies of Far-From-Equilibrium Topological Defects,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023146,"VASHISHTA, PRIYA",PRIYA.VASHISHTA@universityofsoutherncalifornia,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Diffuse Neutron Scattering Studies of Far-From-Equilibrium Topological Defects Priya Vashishta, University of Southern California (Principal Investigator) Far-from-equilibrium phenomena are among the grand challenges of modern condensed matter physics. The understanding of non-equilibrium physics in the vicinity of symmetry-breaking phase transformations has important implications in energy technologies. Symmetry-breaking phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature. Sir Tom Kibble theorized that in the early universe symmetry breaking may have led to the formation of topological defects such as point-like monopoles, cosmic strings or planar domain walls. The defect-formation model, developed originally for cosmology, has found remarkably fruitful applications in condensed matter physics and has become an important addition to the general theory of far-from-equilibrium systems. There is good evidence from disparate systems that a rapid phase transition leads to the formation of a random tangle of defects. Defects form as the cooling or quenching process begins and small regions of local order appear within the disordered medium. These regions form a mosaic of causally disconnected domains of local order, each pointing in a random direction with respect to the rest. The regions grow until they encounter each other. Yet, we do not fully understand how the rate at which a system passes through a phase transition affects the number of defects formed. The goal of the project is to investigate far-from-equilibrium physics of rapidly quenched multiferroic manganites and SpinIce materials that combines kinematic constraints, emerging topological defects using joint simulation and experimental study. Diffuse Neutron Scattering experiments on multiferroic manganites and SpinIce materials will be carried out at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We will use Reactive and Quantum Dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo method along with Neural Network Quantum Molecular Dynamics to compute diffuse neutron scattering for rapid thermal and magnetic-field quench and perform classification and analysis of the defects created in far-from-equilibrium processes. The main quantitative prediction of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism of far-from-equilibrium dynamics and phase transitions is a quantitative scaling relation between the density of topological defects and the quench rate using their equilibrium critical exponents. To verify the KZ mechanism, we will determine the defect structure and densities in thermally quenched multiferroic manganites and magnetic-field quenched SpinIces from diffuse neutron scattering data. Owing to the availability of large amounts of neutron data containing different defect densities and topological structures from thermal and magnetic-field quench rates, machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to address this difficult problem. We will use ML techniques including deep neural networks (DNN) and Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) to classify defects and infer topological structures from diffuse neutron scattering data. Neutron experiments on multiferroic manganites will be carried out in collaboration with Professor Despina Louca, University of Virginia, and Neutron experiments on SpinIce material Dy2Ti2O7 in collaboration with Professor Alan Tennant, University of Tennessee & ORNL."

From a theoretical point of view, cloud droplets can grow by water vapor diffusion only to sizes where collisional growth is still inefficient. This is often referred to as the condensation-coalescence bottleneck, between approximately 15 and 40 microns in droplet radius. In this project, we will apply theory, observations, and numerical modeling to study processes occurring in natural clouds that push droplets through the condensation-coalescence bottleneck. We will use in-situ high- resolution observations from recent Atmospheric Radiation Measurement airborne field campaigns targeting convective clouds. The focus will be on droplet spectral width and its relationship to cloud parameters (e.g., mean radius, adiabatic fraction, local turbulence intensity, and presence or absence of droplets in the bottleneck size range, as well as the spatial variability of these parameters along-the-flight-path vicinity of the observation location) and environmental conditions (location in cloud, vertical velocity, synoptic conditions and origins of air masses). We will also combine high-resolution droplet spectral information with scale-dependent estimates of the vertical velocity fluctuations derived from the turbulent kinetic energy and aircraft gust probe data to provide for the first time estimates of the supersaturation fluctuation at scales of meters to tens of meters within convective clouds. These fluctuations have been argued in the past to play a critical role in the evolution of the droplet spectra. On the modeling side we will apply a novel Lagrangian modeling approach referred to as the &ldquo;super-droplet method&rdquo; that allows unprecedented fidelity for simulating cloud microphysics. This novel approach mitigates numerical problems facing traditional Eulerian bin microphysics that lead to artificial droplet spectral broadening. Moreover, the Lagrangian approach allows truly multiscale cloud simulations by incorporating a physically-based stochastic subgrid-scale droplet growth scheme. These simulations will employ the Weather Research and Forecasting model in large eddy simulation mode with environmental conditions obtained from field observations. Statistical techniques developed with our previous funding will be used to evaluate model simulations with the observational data."

Constraining the Equation of State of Dense Neutron-Rich Matter,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0013702,"Li, Bao-An",Bao-An.Li@texasa&muniversity-commerce,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","The Equation of State (EOS) of dense neutron-rich matter governs not only the dynamics of nuclear reactions especially those involving rare isotopes but also both static and dynamical properties of neutron stars and their mergers. Because of our poor knowledge about nuclear interactions and correlations at high densities and neutron-proton number (isospin) asymmetries, the EOS of dense neutron-rich matter is still poorly known. In particular, the nuclear symmetry energy encoding information about the energy necessary to make nuclear systems more neutron-rich is currently the most uncertain part of the nucleonic EOS especially at supra-saturation densities. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to determine the EOS of dense neutron-rich matter especially its symmetry energy term as well as the underlying isospin-dependence of strong interactions and short-range correlations in broad ranges of density and isospin asymmetry. Within a comprehensive Bayesian statistical framework using a unified EOS model encapsulating a first-order hadron-quark phase transition, we shall infer the posterior probability distribution functions of dense neutron-rich matter EOS parameters from combined data of multimessenger observations of heavy-ion reactions involving high-energy radioactive beams, isoscalar and isovector optical potentials from charge-exchange reactions and/or nucleon-nucleus scatterings with rare isotopes as well as gravitational waves from neutron star mergers and high-precision X-rays from massive neutron stars. The proposed research is relevant for the coming experiments at FRIB (Facility for Rare Isotope Beams) and especially its planned 400 MeV/u upgrade as well as experiments at other radioactive beam facilities around the world. It is also important for the ongoing observations of massive neutron stars by NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) using high-precision X-rays and the continued search of gravitational waves by LIGO/VIRGO and other observatories. Moreover, we will also investigate effects of the isospin-dependence of short-range correlation (SRC) on the EOS of dense neutron-rich matter and their imprints on observables of heavy-ion reactions and neutron stars. The SRC research is also relevant to the ongoing and planned experiments at JLAB (Jefferson National Laboratory), FRIB as well as the future electron-ion collider at BNL (Brookhaven National Laboratory). Overall, the objectives of our research tie in very well with the U.S. national priorities in nuclear science. In particular, the proposed research is of directly relevance to addressing the following two overarching science questions identified in the 2015 NSAC Long-Range Plan: (1) What is the nature of neutron stars and dense nuclear matter? (2) What is the nature of the nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons in stable and rare isotopes? Results of our planned research will help realize DOE’s scientific goals in nuclear physics. The proposed research will enrich our knowledge in both nuclear physics and astrophysics. Moreover, it will help improve the research infrastructure and workforce training to meet new challenges in nuclear physics and astrophysics."
JET MODIFICATION IN DENSE MATTER FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0013460,"Majumder, Abhijit",Abhijit.Majumder@waynestateuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Jet Modification in Dense Matter from First Principles Abhijit Majumder, Wayne State University (Principal Investigator) This research focuses on a method to study the properties of the hot dense matter created in energetic collisions of heavy atomic nuclei. The building blocks of most of the matter in the universe today can be thought of as protons and neutrons. In combination with electrons, these produce the variety of atoms found in nature. However, neutrons and protons are themselves made up of quarks and gluons, which interact so strongly that they are usually bound inside protons and neutrons. The existence of quarks and gluons as elementary particles was revealed in extremely energetic proton-proton collisions where collimated jets of particles were observed. Jets are produced in the sequential decay of a single quark or gluon that has been ejected in a proton-proton collision and as such carry the energy and momentum of that quark or gluon. Over decades of study in proton-proton collisions, jets and their decay dynamics have become very well understood, such that they are now being used as probes of a highly excited state of matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The QGP is produced in the collision of atomic nuclei at extremely high energies, and represents a new state of matter, with a temperature above 2 trillion degrees, where the quarks and gluons are no longer bound within nucleons, but may travel over distances the size of an atomic nucleus. Though not bound, the interaction between the quarks and gluons is still extremely strong, leading to unique properties of the QGP, such as the ability to equilibrate almost instantly, and have an almost inviscid behavior. The QGP last existed microseconds after the Big Bang and is now routinely produced at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. Formed briefly in the collision of two large nuclei, the QGP undergoes explosive expansion and cooling, eventually turning into a spray of ordinary matter. The short lived nature of the QGP has made studying it rather difficult. Over the last decade, jets produced in the occasional heavy-ion collision, and their modification due to passage through this dense system have become the leading probes of the QGP. The research under this grant will continue the work of formulating a rigorous theoretical basis for the study of the internal structure of the QGP using jets, as well as the construction of elaborate computer simulations to test novel theoretical ideas in an almost realistic setting. In this grant period, research will focus on a deeper understanding of the interaction between the jet and the QGP. Typically this is understood by means of quantities called transport coefficients, which encode a variety of information from the exchange of energy and momentum, to possible conversions of jet quarks into gluons and vice versa, to how the deposited energy and flavor diffuse away in the plasma. These coefficients will be evaluated using first principle methods on numerical lattice simulations (lattice QCD). One aspect of the research will derive the formalism to relate these quantities calculated on the numerical lattice with realistic measurements in experiment. Another effort will attempt to reveal the dependence of these coefficients on the properties of the jet particles themselves. Additional efforts will focus on new coefficients that evaluate the probability for quarks (gluons) in a jet to turn into a gluon (quark), with the original quark (or gluon) flavor diffusing into the QGP. Other theoretical efforts will include computation of higher order corrections to explicitly impose consistency checks on the formalism. On the phenomenology side, ongoing efforts will continue and complete extensive comparisons between two stage energy loss approaches, using the JETSCAPE framework, and a wide range of experimental data. These simulations now include a gradual weakening of the transport coefficient for higher energy jet particles as predicted in the prior grant period. So far most simulations approximate only a thin slice of the medium produced in nuclear collisions, allowing the study of a 3-dimensional (3-D) medium to be simplified to 2-dimensions (2-D). Over the next two years, large scale efforts will be carried out to extend simulations of the bulk medium to 3-D, and the interaction of the jet with the medium to wider angles away from the jet axis. This will require the incorporation of energy momentum diffusion coefficients devised in the prior grant period within the simulation framework. Other efforts will focus on the development of a state-of-the-art jet energy loss simulator. Current simulators tend to simulate the propagation of a jet in at least two stages: A stage where the quarks or gluons of the jet are highly unstable and decay rapidly, to a stage where they propagate through the QGP and intermittently decay during an interaction with the medium. The new simulator will be able to encompass both of these regimes in a seamless execution. An entirely new effort to extend the energy loss of jets to small systems created in the collisions of protons on nuclei, as currently measured, and in future experiments involving electron-nucleus collisions will be started. This will involve extensions of the framework to include the simulation of jets in the initial state of a proton nucleus or electron nucleus event."
Deep Learning for Germanium-Based Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Searches,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0022339,"Gruszko, Julieta",Julieta.Gruszko@theuniversityofnorthcarolinaatchapelhill,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","The non-zero masses and neutral electric charge of neutrinos allows for the possibility that neutrinos are their own antiparticles (i.e. Majorana particles). If that is the case, then a second-order, lepton-number-violating, weak interaction referred to as neutrinoless double-beta decay (0nBB) may occur. The ultra-rare nature of the decay requires experimental backgrounds to be strictly controlled. In current-generation experiments, the lowest backgrounds have been achieved by using high-purity germanium detectors enriched in 76Ge. These detectors have excellent energy resolution and pulse-shape discrimination capabilities ,and employ novel background reduction techniques developed by the MAJORANA and GERDA collaborations. The LEGEND experiment, the first phase of which will begin data-taking in 2021, is a next-generation 76Ge-based 0nBB search that will have a sensitivity 2 orders-of-magnitude beyond what has been presently demonstrated. To maximize the sensitivity of 0nBB experiments, background reduction approaches must leverage all of the spatial and timing information contained in the detector pulse-shapes. Advances in computing have opened the door to a range of advanced signal modeling and data interpretation techniques that take advantage of the well-understood microphysical behavior in 76Ge-based detectors. Simulations that track individual charged particle trajectories within the detector are now within reach, allowing for high-fidelity detector response modeling. These models can in turn be used to develop and evaluate the performance of both ""traditional"" analysis techniques and novel deep-learning based methods. At the same time, the shift from experiments with ~50 detectors to ~350 detectors, as 76Ge-based experiments move to the ton-scale, demands that the analysis process be streamlined and automated as much as possible. Analysis techniques that produce results in real-time or nearly-real-time and can easily adapt to changing operating conditions promise to maximize the live time of these experiments, and therefore their physics reach. This proposal seeks to develop machine learning-based techniques for data cleaning, analysis, and event classification in the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR and LEGEND. Especially, my group aims to develop: • An unsupervised learning-based, semi-automated waveform clustering algorithm for data cleaning • A transformer-based neural network model for automated adaptive electronics response modeling and deconvolution; • A supervised learning-based, boosted decision tree approach to streamline traditional analysis parameter calibration and event classification; and • A semi-supervised learning-based event classier that leverages high-fidelity pulse shape alteration to improve background event discrimination. The architectures we propose are built on models of the detector physics and electronics. The approaches we plan to pursue remain highly-interpretable and/or have easily variable behavior, while maximizing use of the available event information. By using new computational techniques to understand and reduce backgrounds, my group will further the physics reach of next-generation 0nBB searches and guide the design of future efforts, potentially leading to the determination of the Majorana or Dirac nature of neutrinos."

This mission requires innovation in the development of improved data-driven and model-based approaches that maximize plasma performance in existing experiments (with focus on the DIII-D facility) with impact on optimizing operational scenarios. The focus of the research and development in this proposal is to efficiently integrate an improved version of the artificial intelligence (AI) enabled deep learning FRNN prediction and control software into the DIII-D PCS for planning realistic real-time strategies embedded in control software that can improve the plasma performance in DIII-D with relevance for the burning plasma ITER facility. The R&D proposed here will further develop the successful AI/Deep-learning (DL) fusion recurrent neural network (FRNN) software beyond the disruption forecasting capability to now include a real-time-capable first-principles based simulator (SGTC) described in the following. We will be guided by a proper implementation of FRNN within a proximity control architecture designed to identify and predict the major causes of disruptions [Barr2021] that involves active engagement & collaboration with the DIII-D Plasma Control Group. Through the convergence between AI/DL and model simulations via high performance computing (HPC), the proposed new AI/DL capability can provide not only the “disruption score,” as an indicator of the probability of an imminent disruption, but also a “sensitivity score” in real-time to indicate the underlying reasons for the predicted disruption. The overarching aim here is to demonstrate that real-time modification of the plasma state can lead to a more favorable thermodynamic one to avoid or delay the onset of disruptions. In order to systematically progress toward our stated goal, a key AI/DL (artificial intelligence/deep learning) software challenge is to build a modern high-performance computing (HPC) enabled synthetic plasma simulator that is capable of carrying out HPC-driven real-time plasma control applications. This involves development of a deep learning framework to train a surrogate model to enable accurate first-principles-based instability analysis – i.e., a simulator (SGTC) derived from the global electromagnetic gyrokinetic code GTC [Lin1998]. Overall, the integration of the latest version of the FRNN prediction and control software will include the further development and application of the pre-trained surrogate model (SGTC) that is benchmarked against HPC results from the well-established electromagnetic GTC code. Moreover, our focus on experimentally measured signals will include ECEI and the development of a synthetic ECEI interface for associated GTC HPC simulation results (i.e., “SGTC-ECEI”). The mission here is to provide inference at a time-scale relevant for real-time applications. The specific role of SGTC is to provide additional accurate and detailed plasma instability information for real-time plasma control beyond the capability of conventional machine learning approaches focusing only on measured signals. These tools will enable accelerated progress toward the realization of a realistic plasma state simulator that can be directly implemented into the DIII-D PCS to guide real-time control. In summary, realistic additional first-principles-based information from SGTC combined with the predictive power of FRNN will collectively provide timely warning of oncoming disruptions, together with actionable information on instability properties that can be used to inform a specific, targeted actuation strategy. This proposal thus describes a collaborative path with DIII-D towards an AI-powered real-time predictive plasma control and actuation strategy with the goal of proactively avoiding disruptive instabilities while maximizing plasma performance."

Technologies like the production of hydrogen from natural gas and the use of hydrogen in fuel cell electric vehicles necessitate the development of flexible hydrogen storage capacities at different spatial and temporal scales. A significant component of hydrogen infrastructure development will also depend on our ability to store large quantities of hydrogen for large- scale industrial processes or to support hydrogen power generation and the development of ""hydrogen hubs"" in different parts of the US. Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) in geological formations is one of the most promising technologies to store H2 due to its massive storage space, extensive availability, established infrastructure, safety provided by caprock, and lower costs. UHS in salt caverns is already underway at a full industrial scale in the UK and US. Salt caverns are good candidates for H2 gas storage due to their large capacity, inert nature, low leakage, fast withdrawal, and fast injection rates. Unfortunately, salt caverns are not widely geographically distributed and might not be available where hydrogen storage is required. Hence, assessing hydrogen storage potential in other porous reservoirs, such as natural gas storage fields, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and saline aquifers, is critical. The advantage of using these porous reservoirs for H2 storage is that they are more widely distributed, offer storage capacities many orders of magnitude larger than salt caverns, have been extensively studied in the context of CO2 storage, their depth/size/storage capacity are well characterized, and they have well-defined seals to prevent H2 leakage. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the physical, chemical, and biological interactions of hydrogen with the brines-minerals-microbes in these reservoirs. These interactions could eventually impact the efficiency and security of H2 storage by generating corrosive sulfide gas leading to hydrogen contaminations or losing H2 due to solubility, geochemical reactions such as dissolution and precipitation, microbial utilization, and permeability changes or via diffusion in caprocks. Lack of understanding of such processes highlights significant technical risks in the development of subsurface H2 storage, especially when recognizing widespread materials compatibility issues in H2 systems operating at elevated pressures, the likely scale of H2 deployment, and general difficulties in the sealing of H2 storage systems. The goal of the proposed project is to enable a fundamental understanding of the geochemical, physical, and biological reactions that could impact the performance and safety of hydrogen storage in subsurface porous reservoirs. Our central hypothesis is that these coupled physicobiogeochemical processes could result in a significant loss of H2 stored in subsurface reservoirs. In the proposed research, we will use an integrated experimental, theoretical and computational approach to investigate H2 losses associated with geochemical, microbial, and physical processes and assess the potential impacts of H2 leakage on groundwater quality. The data generated on short- and long-term chemical reactivity, kinetics, and H2 transport in this project will provide the foundation for safe, large-scale underground hydrogen storage technologies in reservoirs widely distributed across the U.S, accelerating H2 supply chain development."

Chen, Columbia University (Co-Investigator) William A. Goddard III, California Institute of Technology (Co-Investigator) Yushan Yan, University of Delaware (Co-Investigator) Deep decarbonization of the energy sector needs green hydrogen (H2) from water electrolysis that utilizes electricity from carbon-free sources. H2 is a clean fuel, and a valuable chemical used in a variety of large-scale industrial processes including the production of ammonia (i.e., fertilizer). Currently, the majority of H2 is produced from fossil resources, which is responsible for over 900 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. An exciting advance in water electrolysis technologies in recent years is the development of hydroxide exchange membrane electrolysis (HEMEL), which allows the potential use of inexpensive electrocatalysts and low-cost membranes and ionomers. Despite this progress, the cost of H2 (at ~$5/kg) from state-of-the-art HEMEL is still 5-fold higher than the Department of Energy's target for possible commercial viability. The key limitations that need to be addressed to establish advanced HEMEL for scaled use include: (1) electrocatalysts based on inexpensive metals with limited activity and durability under realistic operating conditions and insufficient atomistic and molecular understanding of catalyst design principles; (2) limited understanding of the complicated interfaces between catalysts, ionomers, and hydroxide exchange membrane that govern membrane electrode assembly (MEA) performance and longevity. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a deep understanding of how atomic structures and molecular environments of catalytic sites affect catalyst properties and how chemically-tailored catalysts/ionomers/membrane interfaces can be steered toward optimized MEA performance. By leveraging the diverse and complementary expertise of our research team, we will unravel catalyst and interface design principles through a combination of computational and experimental approaches, and understand how to improve MEA performance by ligand-tailoring and crosslinking catalyst/ionomer/membrane interfaces. The new knowledge and experimental/theoretical tools developed in this project will enable the continued design of increasingly efficient and inexpensive catalysts as well as predictive models for water electrolyzers. The success of this project will contribute to clean H2 production using electricity produced from carbon-free sources (e.g., solar), potentially transforming the U.S. energy portfolio. It aligns with the Department of Energy's mission of reducing the H2 production cost using water electrolyzers to $1 per 1 kg in 1 decade."

In addition, we aim to leverage collaborative research and build a long-term partnership between Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). Our central hypothesis is that reinforcement by inorganic microfibers can significantly reduce shrinkage cracks in the bentonite because of the added frictional and tensile resistances in the microstructure by the microfibers. To test this hypothesis, this project will pursue the following research objectives: (1) Advance our understanding of the fundamental thermo-, hydro-, chemo-, mechano-, and geometrical characteristics of inorganic microfiber-reinforced EBS constituents (i.e., bentonite and fibers), their interfaces, and composites in the conditions simulating the geological environment of the repository; (2) Develop and run advanced multiscale-multiphysics tests and computational models to simulate composite behavior in the geological environment of the repository. In particular, the computational efforts will account for the hydraulic saturation and consequent mechanical swelling, thermal diffusion, dehydration, and desiccation cracking, multiphase fluid transport, plastic deformation, and chemical degradation; and (3) Integrate the experimentation with computational modeling to calibrate and validate the model. The validated-calibrated model will serve as a tool to further investigate the effects of individual design variables on the behavior of inorganic microfiber-reinforced EBS, which will enable us to identify core variables and propose a more reliable engineered buffer system for practical application over a long period of time. Upon conclusion of this project, we will advance the state of scientific knowledge and understanding and address a critical gap in nuclear science and engineering research of engineered barrier or buffer systems for high radioactive disposal facilities. Findings from this work will provide fundamental knowledge for the ultimate development and implementation of more reliable EBS materials.

Propagation in this regime can be adversely affected by multiple laser-plasma instabilities that grow rapidly on the timescale of the laser beam duration. These instabilities can reduce the efficiency of the laser driver by exciting plasma waves that absorb energy, produce hot electrons, or scatter laser energy into undesired directions. As a result, there has been sustained interest in finding and developing approaches for mitigating laser-plasma instabilities. The topology of plasma waves driven by helical laser beams offers a previously unexplored level of control over laser-plasma interactions. A comprehensive understanding of these interactions could reveal novel strategies for mitigating instabilities. The emergence of capabilities to generate helical beams at high energy laser facilities, like OMEGA and NIF, underscores the importance of a timely examination into the impact of helical laser drivers in the context of HED plasmas. This project aims to advance the understanding of laser-plasma instabilities driven by helical laser beams in HED-relevant plasmas. In contrast to conventional beams, helical laser beams can exchange angular momentum with a plasma and excite helical plasma waves. The helical topology of the plasma wave fundamentally changes how the wave interacts with electrons and ions, which alters the evolution and properties of instabilities, including growth rates, thresholds, and saturation."
Programmable Non-Equilibrium Electrified Ammonia Synthesis for Efficient Hydrogen Storage,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023357,"Hu, Liangbing",Liangbing.Hu@universityofmaryland,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Hydrogen is expected to play a significant role in the emerging energy landscape. However, it is challenging to store and transport hydrogen economically and safely. A promising approach is to store hydrogen in the form of ammonia. Ammonia is a liquid and has higher energy density than both liquid and compressed hydrogen at 700 atm per unit volume. Thus, it is easer and safer to be stored and transported. However, the industrial Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis requires high pressure and high temperature, and is highly energy and carbon intensive. On the other hand, atmospheric synthesis of ammonia using electricity requires catalysts to improve the performance, but they often suffer from poor catalytic activity and stability due to the lack of effective designs and the constraints of chemical equilibrium. It is therefore imperative to develop efficient catalysts (e.g., nanostructured catalysts with complex compositions) and new synthesis methods that break the near-equilibrium thermodynamic limit via process innovations to enable highly active and durable electrified ammonia synthesis. In this project, a programmable non-equilibrium electrified ammonia synthesis approach for efficient hydrogen storage will be developed. Studies will focus on the surface and gas-phase chemistries that occur during the non-equilibrium ammonia synthesis via multiscale modeling and advanced diagnostics. Explorations will include predictive catalyst design and controllable catalyst synthesis, and investigate the activity and stability behaviors of the catalysts under non-equilibrium operating conditions. In addition, variations will interrogate the role of the chemical equilibrium and reaction kinetics via a membrane reactor design. The proposed project will advance fundamental knowledge of dynamic catalysis and non-equilibrium materials through advanced in-situ and ex-situ diagnostics and characterization coupled with state-of-the-art multiscale modeling. The outcomes from the proposed research will include: (1) mechanistic understanding and predictive models of dynamic catalysis, non-equilibrium catalyst compositions, and the factors enabling catalyst stability under dynamic operation conditions; (2) new mechanistic understanding on the non-equilibrium ammonia synthesis reaction based on advanced laser diagnostics and multiscale modeling; (3) the development of non-equilibrium ammonia synthesis reactor integrated with novel catalysts, a multifunctional bilayer membrane, and a series of in-situ and ex-situ diagnostics tools for process optimization.

For instance, it has been shown that imaging with quantum entangled photons can beat the diffraction limit, decrease the noise floor beyond the shot-noise limit, and thus, enable ultra-low-dose imaging. Nevertheless, challenges associated with the extremely inefficient generation of entangled photons (i.e., low-brightness), the fragility of their quantum states, and reliance on photon-sparse imaging protocols have stalled attempts at translating those technologies to practical field use. Those issues have also necessitated long data acquisition times. Consequently, the temporal resolution that is important for probing dynamic biosystems must be traded in for an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio for image interpretation. Surprisingly, several phenomena once thought to be exclusive to quantum entangled photons had been successfully replicated with classical light carrying anti-correlations or nonseparable degrees of freedom (DOFs) without needing to invoke bona fide quantum correlations. This gives rise to an emerging field now known as classical entanglement. The ability to perform quantum mimicry using special forms of classical light has far-reaching implications, both in the potential of overcoming inherent shortcomings of quantum light sources and in the practical considerations of translating those advantages for robust imaging applications. This proposal aims to build upon the principles of classical entanglement and develop new and untested (1) classes of anti-correlated light sources and (2) quantum-inspired imaging protocols that fit into the theoretical framework for recapitulating desirable super-performing imaging traits (e.g., the performance that surpasses those set by classical limits). More specifically, efforts will be focused on testing the quantum-like characteristics of newly developed light pulses proposed in this work and applying them to enhance the performance of optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT’s label-free cross-sectional imaging capabilities are especially suited for in situ probing of plant biology. We note the much-heralded improvement in resolution and sensitivity in bona fide quantum imaging scale with the number of simultaneously entangled biphotons. The analogous parameter to consider for our approach to quantum mimicry is the number of nonseparable DOFs, including static, time-varying, spatial-varying spin and orbital angular momentum of light, wavelengths, and spatial modes. Therefore, we aim to perform research on the underpinning principles for wavefront and field control of structured light, such that the knowledge can be applied to design and construct beams with high-dimensional nonseparable DOFs. Our approach towards this is superimposing multiple optical pulse pairs from a family of anti-correlated topological, spectral, spatial, and temporal fields and wavefronts. We will subsequently develop interferometric systems and image reconstruction protocols for OCT bioimaging based on the optical considerations for those classically entangled beams. Characterization of the imaging instrument and validation of its performance will be carried out to benchmark its performance against comparable technologies without classical entanglement. By working closely with experts in plants and microbiological systems, the developed imaging technology will be designed to be applicable for in situ imaging of plant biological systems relevant to biomass and bioenergy investigations. The novelty of this work lies in harnessing the latest development in novel designer structured light and spatiotemporal wave packets carrying topologies for advancing quantum mimicry, which could potentially lead to quantum-like imaging advantages without sacrificing optical brightness. The quantum-like advantages pursued in this proposal include low-noise, high-sensitivity imaging through turbid and scattering media. These enhanced capabilities could impact plant research on multiple fronts, from imaging dynamically evolving bio-events with unprecedented precision to probing photo-sensitive biosystems with the lowest dose possible. Moreover, we anticipate the new concepts and techniques developed in this work to be applicable and extendable to different ranges of wavelengths, including mid-infrared, short-wave infrared, and soft x-ray spectra for bioimaging applications."

We will determine the mechanisms that regulate VOC influences on soil C stabilization. We have three main objectives: Objective 1: Determine how root-released VOCs and VOC transformed by the soil microbial communities directly influence soil C cycling and stabilization; Objective 2: Determine how VOCs can influence soil C stabilization indirectly by acting as chemicals that carry information (i.e., infochemicals) needed for communication between organisms; and, Objective 3: Identify the role of VOC movement between otherwise separated regions in the soil (i.e., teleconnections) that most strongly enhance VOC conversion to stable C pools. We will address these objectives using soil probes that non-destructively quantify in situ soil VOC consumption and production, online soil/root measurement systems, unique field sites and infrastructure, and time-resolved C-VOC stable isotope labeling in laboratory-based artificial rhizosphere systems and growth chambers. We believe this work will represent the first quantification of the potential impact of direct, indirect, and teleconnection roles of root VOCs on soil C pools. If VOC contributions are significant, this project will directly impact conceptual and numerical models that aim to enhance our understanding of soil C cycling and stabilization in the soil and contribute to a new frontier in microbial systems science that embraces VOCs as integral components of the suite of organic compounds present in an ecosystem. Further, this project will innovate on approaches to non-destructively track microbial metabolism through real-time sensing that complements the destructive snapshots provided by most other ‘omics-based techniques."

A key example of this is the suppression of the edge-localized-modes (ELMs) by resonant 3D magnetic perturbations (RMPs). ELMs constitute a major challenge to the operation of fusion-grade tokamak plasmas such as ITER due to the large transient heat loads they deliver to plasma facing components (PFCs). US scientists have pioneered the development of the 3D-field approach to ELM control since its first discovery and have a crucial role in exporting the technique to international facilities such as the KSTAR tokamak in Korea, the EAST tokamak in China, and the AUG tokamak in Germany. Recent international collaborations have enabled the project team to compile comprehensive 3D databases, develop testable criteria for the accessibility and threshold conditions of ELM suppression, improve understanding of underlying particle transport for predicting pedestal profile modifications and heat flux to PFCs, and adaptively control 3D fields to restore confinement under ELM suppression. These recent accomplishments have exposed opportunities for the US scientists to resolve remaining challenges, such as the compatibility of 3D ELM suppression with core optimized scenarios as well as heat loads to PFCs for long pulses. Enhanced physics models, databases, and experimental analysis infrastructures developed by this project team will be all leveraged utilizing the strong partnerships among the multi-institutional US groups and international collaborators. Predictive capabilities for 3D edge perturbations, transport, and ELM suppression will be validated over international databases with analysis utilizing US cutting-edge 3D simulations. Intelligent control algorithms for the 3D field operational windows and associated profile alterations will be developed and integrated into TRANSP for long pulse optimization. This novel ‘3D TRANSP’ will be tested and refined on KSTAR with the new tungsten divertors, in preparation for ITER applications. In parallel, the 3D field physics basis will be extended to optimize fast ion losses and heat flux to divertors. Understanding of turbulent transport across 3D magnetic topologies including edge and core island chains as well as stochastic field lines will also be extended. All these developments will be integrated to establish optimized long pulse scenarios with 3D fields in KSTAR. The predictive 3D scenario optimizations will be then combined with real-time, actively probing, adaptive controllers to demonstrate ELM-free H-mode scenarios in KSTAR for long pulses of up to 300s with ??N>2.0, minimal core MHD, maximized confinement, and minimized heat loads to plasma facing components."

But, the boundary plasma also interacts with the surrounding solid walls, potentially damaging the wall surfaces and producing in the process impurity atoms that can cool and dilute the core plasma, slowing the fusion reactions. Progress towards understanding and predicting the boundary plasma has been elusive because the dynamics of individual plasma particles must be taken into account and the small-scale physics at the individual particle motion level interact with the large scale collective physics at the device scale level; simpler approaches in which the plasma is characterized only by average properties have not fared well.

The CCRC has gathered a focused faculty and scientific staff with diverse expertise together with state-of-the-art instrumentation and is in the unique position to take on major challenges in carbohydrate science, for research advances and methods for the whole scientific community. This DOE Center renewal proposal will focus on a program to research the structure, biosynthesis, and function of the plant cell wall polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I), a ubiquitous and structurally complicated pectic polysaccharide that exists in the cell walls of all vascular plants. Plant biomass is an abundant renewable resource for the production of carbon-based bioproducts, including fuels, chemicals, and materials. Nevertheless, a detailed understanding of the structural and molecular organization of diverse plant cell walls, which constitute the bulk of plant biomass, is critical for the development of experimental approaches for its conversion into new nature-inspired and energy-efficient fuels and products. Due to its complexity and structural variation, RG-I represents one of the least understood wall polysaccharides; therefore, development of new analytical schemes to elucidate the structure, synthesis, and roles of RG-I in wall architecture will provide critical insights into how carbon-rich cell walls are assembled and modified during the life of a plant. We propose a set of complementary strategies to elucidate the structure of RG-I, including both bottom-up and top-down approaches. For the bottom-up approach, we will exploit the rich diversity of carbohydrate active enzymes found in the gut microbiome to identify new enzymes for cleavage of specific bonds within RG-I. These enzymes will be used to obtain RG-I fragments, which can then be structurally characterized with spectrometric methods. However, depolymerization entails the loss of structural information, and for this reason, we will also pursue a top-down approach, analyzing cell wall matrices as a whole. What makes this challenging is that these matrices are mostly insoluble and thus resist spectroscopic analysis and that they contain a large proportion of uronic acids, which are prone to side reactions during chemical derivatization. We have found that permethylation solubilizes most cell wall substrates, so that they can be analyzed by gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we propose to study cross-links between RG-I and other biopolymers in the cell. To further our understanding of RGI biosynthesis and function, we will use the robust HEK293 cell heterologous protein expression system developed at the CCRC and previously used by us to express functional plant cell wall glycosyltransferases (GTs) and GT complexes to study how RG-I synthesis is initiated, the mechanism of RG-I backbone elongation, and the identity and characteristics of enzymes that add the glycosyl and non-glycosyl substituents onto the backbone. We will produce and use sugar nucleotide glycosyl donors and oligosaccharide acceptors of known structure as substrates to test a diverse set of GT candidates expressed in the HEK293 cells system. The transferase activity and catalytic mechanisms of these proteins will be studied using multiple proven and sensitive assays and the functional significance of each protein and the RG-I will be studied via analysis of the structural and developmental phenotypes of the corresponding mutants. We will furthermore look at newly formed, nascent stages of RG-I to obtain a better understanding of RG-I structure and synthesis. The development of improved methods resulting from our RGI research will help overcome some of the broader challenges in the complex carbohydrate field that are currently unsolved. Applying these methods to better understand the structure, function and biosynthesis of other polysaccharides and glycoproteins can also help foster close collaborations with other researchers in the field, which will result in high-quality publications and highlights. The DOE center will ensure that these new techniques and methods will be disseminated to the larger scientific community through opportunities for workforce training by various specific workshops and training programs. The CCRC faculty and scientific staff will also offer mentorship to graduate students and post-docs in the RGI research program."

The success of this approach relies on the weak van der Waals (vdW) bonds in graphite, which allow 2D graphene layers to be easily separated, thereby liberating the III-V epi-layer from the graphene/GaAs substrate. It is expected that 2D material-assisted thin film exfoliation is also applicable to polycrystalline materials, such as thin film chalcopyrites, CdTe and perovskites; however, no research efforts have been devoted to study and develop this concept for a broad-range device integration. In this project, the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute (HNEI) at the University of Hawaii and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) will partner with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to expand the concept of 2D material-assisted thin film exfoliation from III-V monocrystalline to polycrystalline materials, focusing on the chalcopyrite semiconductor class and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs, e.g., MoS2 and MoSe2) 2D interfacial layers that can naturally form when sulfur- or selenium-containing semiconductors are deposited onto transition metal (TM) substrates. The overarching goals of the project will not only be to discover 2D TMDCs that can facilitate exfoliation of a variety of polycrystalline materials, but also to tune the physical and chemical structures of 2D TMDCs to transfer a predetermined number of 2D layer(s) with the polycrystalline materials and thus create controllable and optimized interface energetics. We will use a theory-synthesis-characterization feedback loop based on a multi-disciplinary methodology that has been established and refined by over a decade of collaboration between theorists at LLNL, the synthesis groups at HNEI and NREL, and the characterization team at UNLV, to accelerate the developments of promising 2D TMDCs and advance the knowledge and ability to control and optimize properties in interface material science."

Applications of porous materials include energy-efficient separations, capture of harmful chemical compounds from air and water, as well as thermal energy storage and adsorption cooling. The objectives of this collaborative activity involving Ilja Siepmann (University of Minnesota), Alán Aspuru-Guzik (University of Toronto), Haoyuan Chen (The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley), Daniela Kohen (Carleton College), and Randall Snurr (Northwestern University) are to develop, improve, and extend computational/theoretical chemistry methods and data-driven science approaches to study these systems. This, in turn, will enable (i) de-novo design of porous materials for targeted applications of increasing complexity, (ii) discovery of the most promising porous materials from the large space of synthesized and hypothetical framework structures and the optimization of process conditions for specific applications, and (iii) microscopic-level understanding of the fundamental interactions underlying the function of porous materials for energy-relevant applications. The research activities of this project are organized into four topic areas: (1) Overarching Computational Tools, (2) Machine Learning for Adsorption in Porous Materials, (3) Selection of Working Pairs for Adsorption Cooling and Related Processes, and (4) Understanding Mixture Effects and Materials Complexity on Adsorptive Separations. Methods developed in the first two areas will be applied to important energy problems in the latter two areas. Computational tools to be developed include improved force fields, updated open-source simulation software, publicly available machine-learning (ML) models and expanded databases. New machine learning methods will focus on physically motivated descriptors, such as histograms of the energy (and energy gradient) felt by a probe species and the 3-D “grid” of probe energies throughout the unit cell. Meta-learning approaches will be used to predict adsorption of complex multicomponent mixtures (with a large number of components) from data for mixtures with fewer components. In the limiting case, a method is proposed to predict binary adsorption from single-component isotherms, which would solve a long-standing problem in adsorption thermodynamics. Inverse design approaches will be used to go beyond materials discovery in a pre-defined materials space. These methods will be developed especially for adsorption cooling and adsorption separations applications. Adsorption cooling and related processes can be powered by low-grade energy such as waste heat and provide a large potential energy saving, as demand for cooling is expected to increase rapidly in the coming decades. Given the large number of potential porous materials and the large chemical space of potential refrigerants – made even larger when one considers also mixtures of different compositions as refrigeration fluids – it is challenging to recommend top working fluid/adsorbent pairs for adsorption cooling and related thermal management processes. The team will use large-scale molecular simulations in conjunction with ML to find top-performing working fluid/adsorbent pairs for adsorption cooling and related thermal management processes. Chemical separations are estimated to consume 10-15% of global energy, and porous materials can play a key role in reducing the energy requirement for separations. To move current computational capabilities closer to real applications, the team will investigate mixtures with increased number of components, complexity of components, and concentration ratios (e.g., trace compounds). In addition, the project will consider porous materials containing defects, interfaces, and hierarchical architectures and frameworks that may undergo phase transitions in response to changes in adsorbate loading – all of which are critical for addressing the problem of difficult molecular separations in real materials."

This effect can be harnessed for the design of new types of sensing technologies and room temperature quantum computing hardware. This project aims to combine state-of-the-art first principles methods with machine learning-based exploration to discover and characterize novel forms of chiral matter associated with such improved spin transport characteristics.

To respond to this call, the central research mission of CD4DC is to discover and develop reticular metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) as catalysts for the decarbonization energy transition and to optimize the key catalytic reactions involved. This will be accomplished by a symbiotic combination of synthesis, catalysis and kinetics, computational modeling and active learning, and characterization. Using widely abundant hydrogen as a primary energy vector would reduce the need for carbon rejection and replace it with hydrogen addition, which requires comparatively lower operating temperatures that will reduce the overall carbon footprint. Future approaches must include processes that convert electric power to chemical energy, and the initial transformation of electric energy to chemical energy will involve electrolysis and generation of H2. A large percentage of hydrogen will be intermittently stored in liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) that can release H2 at the time and place of the target application. The extraction reaction is endothermic, and its utility will depend critically on a combination of the efficiency of dehydrogenation and separation of the dehydrogenated carrier and hydrogen. These processes require highly precise, robust, and stable catalysts for the key generic transformations, namely the addition and release of hydrogen to and from organic molecules and the manipulation of C-C bonds. Catalysts with these desired properties that operate with high efficiency and at low temperatures are not currently available. CD4DC will target the development of three types of catalysts: (1) MOFs with components that provide a high degree of polarizability and softness for superior hydrogen transfer catalysis, (2) MOFs that enable the use of an external electric potential to facilitate catalytic transformations, and (3) MOFs that provide bio-inspired environments for highly selective chemical transformations. Project objectives will be achieved through interactive and iterative efforts of synergistic computational and experimental techniques that leverage our unique, multi-disciplinary team. MOFs are the central component of the design strategy because of their unmatched diversity within the boundaries of a well-defined class of materials, the uniformity of their characterizable active centers, the tailorable sterically and chemically well-defined environments near the active site, and the ancillary components that modulate transport and selectivity. These properties facilitate explanatory and exploratory molecular-level computational modeling of catalyst properties for molecular-level control of catalytic transformations. The theoretical and computational component of our center, aided by active learning, will identify key structure–function relationships for catalytic activity and aid hypothesis-driven understanding and design of catalysts and catalytic pathways. Such design—particularly of the catalytic active center, environment, and reaction mechanism—creates a synergistic cycle between theory, experiment, and active learning that will drive success. At the end of the four-year program, we will have laid the foundation for the decarbonization transition by understanding and validating the requirements for targeted chemical transformations using MOFs and will have advanced the tools for de novo design of catalysts via modular synthesis. Moreover, the active learning-driven integration of high-throughput experimentation and computation will generate significant new knowledge on MOF-based catalysis that will be available to the broader energy research community."

Inspired by the Urban IFL call to provide knowledge that informs equitable solutions that can strengthen community-scale resilience, we propose a people-centered, transdisciplinary IFL. BSEC begins with community priorities (human health and safety, affordable energy, transportation equity, and others) and city government priorities (clean waterways, decarbonization, functioning infrastructure) and designs observation networks and models that will deliver the climate science capable of supporting those priorities. This means that BSEC takes the form of an iterative collaborative cycle, in which an initial observation and modeling strategy is continuously updated in conversation with community partners. The guiding objective of this cycle is to produce the urban climate science needed to inform community-guided “potential equitable pathways” for climate action. In doing so, we address a number of fundamental urban science questions from across natural science and social science disciplines. BSEC focuses on Baltimore, a metropolitan area that is representative of the climate challenges faced by many mid-sized industrial cities in the United States, and in particular with eastern “rust belt” cities that face interlinked challenges of aging infrastructure, stagnant populations, increased heat and flood risk, and inequitable burdens of air and water pollution. These cities are challenging and critical places for equitable climate solutions. The BSEC Equitable Pathways approach aligns urban science with information needs through coupled cycles of model and observation improvement and participatory assessment of climate risks in the context of multiple, potentially competing priorities. Recognizing that city residents and institutions have diverse and sometimes competing goals, we place a multi-objective analysis tool at the center of our project plan. This analysis tool offers an integrating nexus to inform and challenge urban climate science with the decision needs of the residents and stakeholders who ultimately determine the success of climate action. We will deploy advanced urban environmental measurement networks combined with the best urban models available. The model-data observatory will document urban microclimate, hydrology and air quality, indoor and outdoor, with unparalleled resolution and encompass the processes that govern these critical state variables. The model improvement cycle that uses these data and models to develop the best possible urban climate modeling systems will be informed by and adapt to community needs, creating a truly community-centered urban climate observatory. Equitable climate solutions begin with community knowledge. The role of a solutions-oriented urban IFL is to amplify and enhance that knowledge, and this is only possible when there is mutual trust and respect across all project partners. The BSEC team includes collaborators from neighborhood organizations, city government, non-government community development organizations, federal environmental and research agencies, and academic researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Together, we will build a collaborative urban science framework that brings advanced measurement and observation methods into conversation with community and government deliberation on climate action. In doing so, the BSEC IFL will provide a model for community-oriented interdisciplinary urban science that advances climate solutions in Baltimore and that can be applied in many other metropolitan areas. We will also establish a new generation of urban climate scientists and urban modeling systems capable of supporting predictions and community planning across a wide range of urban areas."

Multiple groups of ANME, from methane-rich anoxic environments worldwide, have been described in highly ordered multi-celled consortia with one of several lineages of syntrophic bacterial partners. The pure culture isolation of these slow-growing ANME lineages has not yet been successful; however, culture-independent molecular, geochemical, and imaging approaches have elucidated aspects of their ecology and physiology, offering new insights into the potential mechanism(s) of syntrophic exchange in AOM. High-quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), many curated by our team, are now available for major ANME lineages and their syntrophic bacteria, providing the essential framework for hypothesis development and refinement with in silico metabolic modeling and experimentation. In parallel, molecular, isotopic, and chemical imaging methods have also been developed or optimized by our group for tracking active environmental microorganisms and viruses, as well as assessing the specific metabolism of environmental microorganisms at the level of single cells within anoxic sediments. Additionally, archaeal genetics, including CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, is now mature, offering an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the function of key ANME genes and their emergent phenotypes in a closely related host methanogen. With these advancements, our team of modelers and experimentalists are now uniquely positioned to advance a mechanistic and predictive framework to gain systems-level understanding of methane-based sedimentary ecosystems and syntrophic AOM partnerships. Our proposed multidisciplinary research on AOM and methane-based sediment communities encompasses three main objectives for understanding AOM syntrophy and the broader interactions with associated microorganisms and viruses, as well as their collective role as a methane sink in anoxic sediments. These objectives range in scale from intra-consortia to community-level to ecosystem: 1) to develop a molecular understanding of the mechanisms driving methane-fueled syntrophic interactions; 2) to define and characterize the microbial communities associated with methanotrophic consortia; and 3) to create integrative modeling frameworks to explore the ecophysiology of AOM consortia."

That will require the development of new basic science to support the creation of new, innovative waste form materials to safely store legacy waste. The EFRC, the Center for Hierarchical Waste Form Materials (CHWM) was organized to develop such foundational knowledge from which new waste forms can emerge. CHWM combines experiment, characterization and modeling to generate and validate chemistry and structure motifs that can lead to materials that effectively immobilizing nuclear waste species in persistent architectures.

Novel pathways to assembly of materials spanning these length scales have been demonstrated using focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID), which has the capability to direct appropriate energy electrons to facilitate a wide range of reactions in gas, liquid, and solid phases. Liquid phase (LP) FEBID is a newly emerging approach promising more rapid material synthesis and unique approaches to control of topology and nanostructure resolution. The two principal objectives of this hypothesis-driven research program are (1) discovery of the reaction pathways and thermodynamic interaction maps resulting in formation of 3D topologies of pure metals, metal alloys and multi-material composites with unique phases and crystalline structures by FEBID from liquid-phase precursors, and (2) an experimentally-validated, comprehensive modeling framework and simulation tools to develop a design methodology for optimal operation of LP-FEBID enabled by control of nonequilibrium interfacial processes within charged liquid droplets and ultrathin liquid films. Description of the Project and Methods to be Employed: Utilizing a experimental system invented in our laboratory, NanoElectroSpray-Assisted FEBID (NESA-FEBID), we propose an investigation into the formation of nano/meso/micro-scale materials under conditions relevant to practical fabrication, aiming to develop a quantitative understanding of the basic atomic and molecular processes that underlie the directed multiscale growth of hierarchical structures. At the foundation of our approach are two techniques (film-on-the-substrate and in-flight-droplet spray) for liquid-phase precursor delivery to the NESA-FEBID deposition site that allow us to probe the far-from-equilibrium environments within the high vacuum deposition system and make fundamental insights into the physical and electrochemical phenomena that define the nanomaterial assembly process. By combining modeling and state-of-the-art nanocharacterization methods we will use NESA-FEBID to drive the experimental inquiries and answer the following questions: (1) How do extremely large near-interface gradients of often short lived, highly active direct radiolysis products interact with the bulk, closer to equilibrium, and less directly controlled populations of redox species to induce metal deposition in LP-FEBID? (2) How do nonequilibrium electrons in a nanoscale nucleated solid phase combined with strong perturbation of the local electrochemical environment in the precursor solution impact the pathways and rates of metal cation reduction and resulting 3D nanostructure growth? (3) How do interfacial phenomena, both at the liquid-vacuum interface of an electrified nanodroplet and in the interaction between a nanodroplet and a solid substrate surface on which a nanostructure is formed, contribute to the creation of a metallic solid phase from a dissolved ionic metal precursor in an electron beam induced deposition process? and, (4) What is the role played by solid phase nanomatter formed within charged impinging nanodroplets in determining the shape of the solid phase on a deposition substrate? Potential Impact of the Project: Basic insights and experimental/computational tools resulting from this project will enable discovery and validation of new methods for improving the growth rate, resolution, and composition/phase control of FEBIP made nano/meso/micro-structures and synthesis of 3D-complex hierarchical materials with atomic scale control. Such capabilities will be essential for transforming FEBIP into a truly powerful nanomanufacturing tool with broad applications underpinning many energy related technological areas. Successful results have potential for transformational benefits to a wide range of applications, including energy (nanostructured solar cells and 3D electrodes for electrochemical energy conversion devices), quantum communication and nanoelectronics, highly selective molecular separation and sensing."

The goal is to develop through basic science new opportunities around the concept of “robotic soft matter”, denoting its autonomous ability to rapidly perform mechanical, optical, or chemical tasks with only small inputs of electrical energy and without the use of complex hardware.

The energy deposited due to electron and x-ray impact causes ionization and several types of localized energy exchange processes between neighboring molecules. These ionization and energy exchange processes lead primarily to the ejection of secondary electrons, formation and transfer of holes (absence of electrons) and the formation of atomic and molecular fragments. There are different types of hole transfer processes and they can be enhanced at certain incident energies. Low-energy electrons scatter in the molecular medium and can attach themselves to molecules at specific energies to form negatively charged ions. Both hole transfer and low-energy electron scattering can lead to breaking of chemical bonds and thus cause ‘radiation damage’. The effects are significantly enhanced in particular energy ranges. The relative importance of the rates, dynamics, and cross-sections of all the above-mentioned processes will be studied in detail. This research program measures the cross sections, rates, and energy exchange dynamics in biologically relevant atomic and molecular targets.

Solving these combinatorial optimization problems reliably at scale is challenging but crucial for scientific discovery. Classical combinatorial optimization solvers fail to exploit the similarity between nearby problem instances---which means that even a slight change in the underlying data requires re-solving the problem from scratch. In response, neural combinatorial optimization has explored the use of deep learning techniques to help combinatorial solvers exploit similarities between problem instances. However, the full potential of neural combinatorial optimization solvers has not yet been realized because they often fail to be scalable. By leveraging recent progress in graph neural networks, we aim to develop reliable and efficient randomized algorithms that will overcome the scalability issues of neural combinatorial optimization. In particular, we will apply our approach to solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems arising from enzyme engineering and the design of solid solution alloys. Also, in order to tackle these multidisciplinary challenges, we have assembled a broad team of researchers from mathematics, statistics, computational science, materials science, and biochemistry. The proposed research is organized around five main objectives leveraging randomized algorithms: Develop scalable neural combinatorial optimization solvers using novel efficient graph attention networks via random Fourier features. Develop new random walk-based algorithms to enhance the expressivity and data efficiency of GNNs, resulting in enhanced neural combinatorial optimization solvers that are more accurate and data-efficient. Construct algorithms based on matrix sketching and graph sparsification to reduce the computational cost of solving combinatorial optimization problems with dense graphs. Develop novel uncertainty quantification techniques based on bootstrap methods, which will estimate the errors produced by our randomized algorithms.

Multi-scale Study of Self-Healing Polymers to Enhance Carbon Dioxide Removal,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023473,"Ma, Jihong",Jihong.Ma@theuniversityofvermontandstateagriculturalcollege,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","As the world is faced with a growing number of devastating disasters caused by global warming, cutting or mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and sequestration is among the top priorities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Among the various carbon management technologies, the use of membranes for carbon capture is among the main approaches supported by DOE and National Energy Technology Laboratory due to membranes’ versatility, scalability, and operability. However, many factors, including permeability-selectivity trade-off, aging and plasticization, and particulate fouling, are compromising the performance of CO2 separating polymer membranes. The main issue is an insufficient understanding of the structure-property relationship of these polymer membranes. In this proposed project, we will conduct a multiscale study of CO2 removal using self-healing (SH) polymer membranes. We will consider membrane intrinsic structural properties and the extrinsic fouling mitigation mechanism. Our goal is to enhance the performance of SH polymers for CO2 separations by optimizing polymer structures and their operation conditions. Such an enhancement will be achieved by a systematic and comprehensive investigation combining atomistic simulations, theoretical and numerical gas transport models, and polymer synthesis and characterization that can aid in elucidating the relationship between the chemical composition of supramolecules and ionic liquids, non-bonded interactions, polymer structural dynamics, and gas transport and SH properties, using a wide range of resources and scientific expertise across multi-jurisdictions involving the University of Vermont, University of Alabama, and DOE-Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the production of high-performance CO2 removal modules with high scalability and low energy cost. Our developed advanced SH-polymer-membrane CO2 separation system can efficiently capture the emission of CO2, which can then be permanently sequestered or utilized, leading to improved nation’s energy infrastructure, human lives, and the overall health of the environment. Meanwhile, the use of SH polymers as gas separation membranes will also help prolong the lifetime of CO2 separating membranes and reduce process maintenance by preventing permanent damage as SH polymers can heal themselves upon mechanical tearing and scratching in the gas separation process. Moreover, all these proposed methodologies are applicable in a broader range of science and engineering development, such as materials discovery and smart sensing technologies, which are crucial in a broader range of energy applications."

By leveraging highly specific targeting molecules, coupled with highly sensitive modern scanners, the theranostic strategy enables physicians to “see what they treat” and give the right patient the right therapy. Owing to high relative biological effectiveness, properly targeted alpha emitters such as actinium-225 have emerged as a powerful radiotherapy isotope now in study in clinical trials worldwide. However, a major challenge in the clinical implementatio n of actinium-225 and other alpha emitters is that they do not emit a suitable quantity of positrons or gamma rays to enable high quality imaging. As a consequence, actinium-225 therapy is commonly paired with imaging using a different isotope. However, the current PET isotopes available such as gallium-68 or zirconium-89 are not ideally suited to pair with actinium-225. This is because the size of actinium-225 is significantly larger than those isotopes, causing significant changes in the chelation chemistry and ultimately the imaging and therapeutic properties. The lack of a suitable positron emission tomography imaging surrogate for actinium-225 is a critical barrier to progress in the development of alpha radiotherapy.Recently, the cerium-134/lanthanum-134 pair has been proposed as an imaging surrogate isotope for actinium-225, with excellent PET imaging approaches. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cerium-134 could be used as a PET imaging surrogate for actinium-225, following development of the appropriate chemistry methods. Therefore, we develop novel chelation strategies for cerium-134, using chelators which are already known to be stable binders of actinium-225. We will extend these optimized chemistry strategies for antibody labeling, and demonstrate that the distribution of the resulting cerium-134 agents matches that of the actinium-225 agent. Upon completion of this proposal, we will have developed an optimized theranostic pair consisting of cerium-134 and actinium-225, suitable for subsequent evaluation in cancer models, and ultimately in patients with cancer."
Electric Fields to Modulate Catalyst Thermochemical Properties for Multi-Electron/Multi-Proton Redox Reactions,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023461,"Saouma, Caroline",Caroline.Saouma@universityofutah,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Many catalytic transformations pertinent to clean energy proceed via metal hydride intermediates, whereby a hydrogen atom forms a bond to a metal. For example, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, or LOHCs, allows for the safe storage of hydrogen in liquid form for fuel purpose. Interconversion of the liquid, or stored hydrogen, and hydrogen gas, the fuel, proceeds through a metal hydride. Other applications, such as chemical hydrogen batteries, and the interconversion of chemical and electrical energy in fuel cells, also proceed via metal hydrides. It is therefore important to understand how to control the reactivity of the metal hydride, such that the catalytic process can occur with high selectivity and with minimal energy input. This proposal will explore how the reactivity of the intermediate metal hydride can be modulated by application of an electrostatic field. This will be achieved by appending a homogeneous catalyst to an electrode and seeing how application of a potential impacts the reactivity towards hydrogenation (addition of H2 to a molecule) and dehydrogenation (removal of H2 from a molecule) reactions. This approach may allow for a single catalyst to facilitate a variety of transformations pertinent to clean energy by simply changing the potential of the electrode."
Center for Interacting Geo-processes in Mineral Carbon Storage,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023429,"Detournay, Emmanuel",Emmanuel.Detournay@regentsoftheuniversityofminnesota,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Description: A promising technology for removing CO2 from our atmosphere is sequestration via mineralcarbonation in subsurface mafic and ultramafic rocks, e.g., basalt and peridotite, which are abundant in the Earth’s crust. While this approach theoretically is conceived to outpace anthropogenic CO2 emissions, its full potential is held back by the lack of knowledge of the processes that drive carbon mineralization. Objective and Mission: The main objective of the Center for Interacting Geo-processes in Mineral Carbon Storage is to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the key interacting and multi-scale processes that are necessary to achieve a successful carbonation operation. This will require cohorts of engineers and scientists, from across the spectrum of geomechanics, geochemistry, porous media flow, reactive transport, and sensing technologies, to work in concert towards the common mission of fully developing the fundamental science and engineering capability that will lead to realizing the potential forthesubsurface sequestration of CO2 via mineralization. Methods: Recent pilot scale projects, based on injecting dissolved CO2 in fractured basalt, have indicated that appropriate engineering can create conditions for effective carbon mineralization. The success of such an operation hinges on achieving a sustained dissolution-precipitation reaction between the host rock and dissolved CO2, whose rate is mainly influenced by the chemical potential of the host rock and the pH of the CO2 charge. The extent of the reaction throughout the reservoir is controlled by the ability of the CO2 charge to flow through the rock mass, along the fracture network and into the surrounding pore spaces. In turn, this flow is controlled by how the volume change, induced by the mineralization, clogspores – retarding flow – or creates a network of cracks – promoting flow. Arriving at an effective operation for CO2 mineralization requires that these reaction, flow, and fracture processes, occurring across multiple space and time scales, work in a positive feedback loop. The Center will develop the mechanistic understanding of mineral carbonation in the subsurface by studying the reaction, flow, and fracture processes over three distinct scales: (i) the fracture network scale (meter to kilometer) to describe how the CO2charge is distributed within the reservoir by the natural or engineered fracture system; (ii) the fracture-porous medium scale (decimeter to meter),capturing an individual fracture from which the CO2 is delivered to the surrounding rock; and (iii) the porous medium scale (millimeter to decimeter) of the host rock, where the mineralization reactions and carbon storage takes place. Knowledge about the key processes operating at each of these scales and the physics that bridge between the scales will be obtained through developing, adapting, and applying analytical and numerical modeling, physical experiments, and sensing techniques. Impact:The successful outcome for sequestration of CO2 via mineralization will be measured by our ability to evaluate accurately the rate and amount of carbon that can be stored in a reservoir. Establishing the critical understanding for the quantitative evaluation of mineralization processes, at the core of the Center’s research, will advance our ability to reverse the effects of climate change due to mounting CO2 in our atmosphere."
Interfacial Spectromicroscopy of Water Oxidation at Earth Abundant Solar Photoanodes,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023342,"Geiger, Franz",Franz.Geiger@northwesternuniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Solar water splitting materials that generate the most current often leverage expensive catalysts. Among the materials pursued as affordable and widely available replacements is the most common oxide of iron, hematite. This photochemically stable earth-abundant mineral phase is non-toxic, inexpensive, and readily obtainable in chemically pure form. The iron species located at the surface of hematite pull two electrons out of water's oxygen atom in a process that is known as oxygen evolution reaction. While the oxygen gas produced in this chemical reaction is not valuable, the electrons are, as they can power devices or be stored in a battery for later use. It has been shown empirically that the reaction works best under highly alkaline conditions, however, even then, the maximum possible current density is too low to make the approach viable. This project pursues the hypothesis that this lack of performance is rooted, to a large part, in the fact that the water molecules (the electron source) are unfavorably oriented relative to hematite's surface species. The rationale for pursing this hypothesis is that water molecules are known to point their hydrogen atoms towards negatively charged surfaces, and that the hematite surface is negatively charged under alkaline conditions. In this orientation, water's hydrogen atoms are anticipated to block the electron transfer, and thus inhibit the reaction. Pulling the electrons out of water's oxygen then requires water flipping so that water's oxygen atoms align face-to-face with hematite's surface sites. Theory predicts this process to be associated with a significant energy barrier that requires too high an electrical potential for practical applications. Experiments that can inform a solution to overcoming this problem require access to the interfacial water structure, including water's molecular orientation (""up"" vs ""down"") over hematite. However, progress with such measurements has been hampered by the strong absorber problem, as water and hematite are non-transparent at the relevant colors of light that can be used to probe the aqueous interface. This project overcomes these limits by leveraging novel synthesis of hematite having nanometer thickness and cutting-edge laser technology in the form of ""photonic electrochemical microscopy"". The first approach overcomes the strong absorber problem, the latter replaces the electrical leads on a voltmeter with light in a new tool to simultaneously image, at video frame rates and with 200 nanometer lateral resolution, four experimental readouts: it locates the active iron surface species on the hematite and pinpoints where they carry out the OER, observed as O2 microbubbles in that area, with water's up vs down orientation, while simultaneously imaging the electrical potential under controlled external inputs. The mechanistic insights gained from this project inform on what aspects of hematite (microscopic structure, chemical composition) need to be changed to lower the barriers to water flipping over the surface site. The insights also help understand how to slow competing process at the hematite:water interface. Analogous investigations on currently used expensive catalysts quantifies how surface structure, orientation, potential, and surface site behavior differ from hematite so they may eventually be replaced by earth-abundant phases such as hematite. Taken together, the project tests and establishes causal relations among the various observables and the electrochemical activity during the oxygen evolution reaction, helps improve our mechanistic understanding of how photoanodes pull electrons out of water's oxygen, meets the Department of Energy's program's emphasis on the understanding of fundamental chemical and materials mechanisms, and support the Office of Basic Energy Sciences' mission to understand, predict, and ultimately control matter and energy."

The topological diversity of zeolites is at the core of their expanding use as shape-selective catalysts and adsorbents. It is also the source of the most enduring challenge in zeolite synthesis: how to selectively produce one among the many competing crystals. Organic molecules are used as structure-directing agents (SDA) in the synthesis of silica zeolites. The premise is that molecules that fit tightly into the pores stabilize the crystals, promoting their formation. However, the same SDA can result in zeolites with various sizes and dimensionalities of pores upon changes in temperature, ratio of silica to organics, and even water content in the synthesis mixture. This diversity of outcomes indicates that stabilization of the pores by SDA cannot predict the crystal produced in the synthesis. To date, the molecular mechanisms by which organic SDAs direct the crystallization towards a specific zeolite polymorph are not known. Understanding these mechanisms is key to realize new zeolites for catalysis and separations and is the focus of this project. The formation of zeolites does not proceed through a classical mechanism, but that rather the pathway is multi-step and involves disordered nanoscopic precursors, wherein zeolite crystals are first detected in experiments. The slow continuous evolution of the solubility and structure of precursor aggregates to approach those of a zeolite has been a long-standing puzzle. Recent work by the PIs indicates that it originates in spinodal-like crystallization within glassy precursors to produce a mosaic of zeolitic motifs that slowly coarsen to produce nanocrystals. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that polymorphs are selected by the distinct magnitudes of their nucleation barriers, and calls for consideration of the structure, interfaces, and dynamics of the precursors in the prediction of polymorph selection. This project will integrate zeolite synthesis and multi-scale characterization, high-resolution imaging, computer vision, deep learning, and molecular simulations to elucidate the molecular processes involved in the synthesis of zeolites with organic structure-directing agents. Our goals are to elucidate the interplay between glassy dynamics, negligible nucleation barriers, and nanoconfinement in the development of crystallinity in precursor nanoaggregates, to determine whether the organization of SDA in dense precursors of zeolite synthesis encodes the selection of the zeolite polymorph, to unveil the molecular pathways involved in classical and non-classical molecular mechanisms of growth of zeolites from solution, and to control and predict cross-nucleation between zeolites. We anticipate that this project will lead to a new conceptual framework to understand and predict polymorph selection in crystals that are formed through non-classical mechanisms at conditions very far from equilibrium."

Studies have shown considerable sensitivity of warm cloud properties to changes in microphysics scheme parameters affecting, for example, the rate of precipitation formation. This can alter key climate features such as aerosol-cloud interactions, precipitation characteristics, and climate sensitivity. Increasing resolution improves some aspects of cloud properties, but significant biases persist as resolution increases in E3SM. This suggests structural deficiencies in representing clouds in E3SM. Nonetheless, significant advances have been made recently in process-level understanding and simulation of cloud microphysics. A major advance has been the development of Lagrangian particle-based microphysics that tracks trajectories of individual “super-droplets” in the modeled flow representing a multitude of real cloud droplets (called the “super droplet” method, or SDM). SDM offers several key advantages compared to other detailed microphysical models including bin microphysics, particularly by eliminating numerical diffusion and improving representation of cloud-aerosol interactions. Though it is not feasible to use SDM directly in E3SM, it can be used to improve the bulk microphysics in E3SM. This idea is a key part of the proposed work: using SDM in high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of a variety of cloud regimes to generate an expansive dataset for improving the treatment of microphysics in E3SM. A challenge is how to incorporate these advances in process-level knowledge in a computationally efficient and accurate way, which may require a re-thinking in the design of bulk microphysics schemes. To address this challenge, the team will replace the traditional approach of separate cloud and rain categories with a single liquid category (SLC) approach. Recent work has shown that the SLC approach can substantially improve the representation of rain generation through drop collision-coalescence compared to the traditional two-category approach. The SLC approach replaces separate processes for autoconversion, accretion, and self-collection in the two-category approach with a single collision-coalescence process, modeled by predicting at least four size distribution moments for the single category. The team will train SLC and obtain process rates from the SDM-LES dataset via machine learning (neural network emulation) and Bayesian inference. The SLC approach will be implemented into the P3 microphysics scheme, which is the scheme expected to be used in the E3SM version 3 and 4 releases. The team will test P3-SLC in single-column and global low-resolution tests using E3SM as well as the high-resolution doubly-periodic configuration called SCREAM. A focus through all stages of testing will be on how SLC alters the representation of cloud-aerosol interactions compared to the standard P3 scheme in E3SM. They will also pay particular attention to the coupling with the “cloud macrophysics” to account for subgrid-scale cloud variability, which is especially important for lower resolution applications. The proposed research directly addresses the ESMD topic “i) low level clouds” by using recent advances in detailed process-level modeling of cloud microphysics to improve the treatment of microphysics in E3SM, targeting low liquid clouds. Physically-based, process-level improvements to the microphysics are expected to bring greater fidelity to model simulations, addressing critical uncertainties in representing low clouds in E3SM including cloud-aerosol interactions and cloud-climate feedback."

Multiple analytical techniques are needed to reach high certainty conclusions in a short timeframe but means of combining these techniques has heretofore been disjointed. This project seeks to develop a unified characterization approach of high sensitivity and rapidity that incorporates multiple analytical modalities for enhanced certitude of the outcome. A new tool for multi-modal elemental and isotopic microanalysis of solids, Stigmatic Laser Ion Microscope (SLIM), has been proposed. The SLIM combines stigmatically imaging mass spectrometry (MS) with in-situ optical microscopy. It will enable parallel and instantaneous detection of ions laser-ablated from large ~100µm×100µm fields of view with high lateral (~200 nm) and depth (~1 nm) resolutions. This approach will enable rapid (<1 hour) acquisition of high resolution 2-D isotopic maps over 1 cm2 areas with exact registry with a sub-micron-resolving collinear light microscope. In Phase I, the optical front-end of the SLIM was designed. It combines achromatic light optics with ion extraction and projection optics. Light optics were fabricated, passed extensive testing, demonstrated submicron lateral resolution, and delivered a flat-top laser probe on the sample. This work retired most important engineering risks and successfully demonstrated a proof of concept. We propose to design, build, and demonstrate an alpha prototype of the SLIM. It will function as a stigmatically imaging linear time-of-flight (TOF) MS with ion source based on a deep-ultraviolet femtosecond laser probe. The probe will feature a square flat-top beam profile for homogeneous irradiation of large spots. Ion optics will be manufactured and integrated with the existing light optics to form the front-end of the laser ionization MS with pulsed ion extraction. The alpha SLIM will be then demonstrated in operation with test samples. Usually, MS is the technique with the highest analytical sensitivity available. Yet, commercially available imaging MS instruments perform analyses in raster-scanned microprobe mode at low speed and with moderate sensitivity. The SLIM will make major improvements on both fronts. This combination of properties is expected to foster adoption in fields such as nuclear forensics, geological and environmental sciences, materials science, and life sciences."

Stability Research for Disruption Prediction and Avoidance in MASTU Spherical Tokamak Plasmas,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0018623,"Sabbagh, Steven",Steven.Sabbagh@thetrusteesofcolumbiauniversityinthecityofnewyork(morningsidecampus),"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Stability Research for Disruption Prediction and Avoidance in MAST-U Spherical Tokamak Plasmas S.A. Sabbagh (Principal Investigator), J.W. Berkery, Y.S. Park, Columbia University Disruption prediction and avoidance in tokamaks to enable long-pulse plasma operation are present day “grand challenge” topics in high performance tokamak fusion plasma science. They are top priority, critical issues raised to the level of a dedicated Strategic Objective for Fusion Science and Technology as reviewed in “A Community Plan for Fusion Energy and Discovery Plasma Sciences”, the Report of the 2019–2020 American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics Community Planning Process (CPP). Table A1 in this report shows this as the highest ranked physics Strategic Objective based on polling at the meeting that provided report input (it ranked third, with the first and second-ranked Objectives being technology objectives). The CPP report “forms the basis for the strategy detailed” as stated in the recent FESAC Long Range Plan (LRP) report which first and foremost calls to “build the science and technology required to confine and sustain a burning plasma”. The recognition of disruption prediction and avoidance as highest priority DOE Fusion Energy Sciences strategic priority elements was founded in the DOE report “Fusion Energy Sciences Workshop on Transients Report” (2016). This research directly addresses this objective by aiming at a largely untapped capability of the MAST-U spherical tokamak (ST), uniquely leveraging the low aspect ratio, high elongation, high beta, flexible heating, and 3D coil capabilities of the device to test stability calculations and modeling that support disruption prediction and avoidance. This renewal proposal highly leverages the extensive work already performed to create software interfaces and models that produced required analysis capability that will be of immediate use in this newly-proposed research. This proposal is a coordinated experimental and physics analysis research program to be conducted by a small collaborative U.S. team with extensive experience in the unique aspects and challenges of equilibrium reconstruction, stability analysis, and disruption forecasting of high performance ST plasmas. The overall goal is to produce world-class analysis regarding forecasting and avoidance of disruptions by leveraging the physics understanding over a wide range of MAST-U plasma parameters using direct, quantifiable figures of merit. Several physics analyses are planned using codes and control algorithms either written by or available to the PI and proposal researchers (including our unique and powerful Disruption Event Characterization and Forecasting (DECAF) capability, MISK (kinetic global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability), PHOENIX (automated equilibrium reconstruction), ideal DCON, resistive DCON, M3D-C1, TRANSP, and VALEN-3D. MAST/-U will challenge our existing models for disruption characterization and forecasting, yielding improved physics understanding and modeling to produce a unified disruption forecasting algorithm needed for ITER and future devices. The ITER Control group recently requested to have DECAF installed as part of the ITER control system. Dedicated experiments will also be proposed and conducted on MAST-U for these studies, following our successful experiments from last year including active assessment techniques to measure plasma stability and to test the disruption forecasting research elements. The proposed research has access to the entire MAST-U database, and to the existing MAST plasma database of over 30,000 discharges. The MAST-U device is the only ST device in the world that allows the proposed high stability performance research to demonstrate consistency with the plasma shaping of the most advanced tokamak divertor configurations. MAST-U in its continued operation will run some of the highest stability parameters to date in a fully-diagnosed, mega-amp plasma current-class ST device. Neutral beam injection (NBI) power will range from 3.5 – 5 MW for pulse lengths up to 2s. Plasmas created in the first operational campaign exceeded one second – longer than the key physics timescales of interest needed for the proposed physics studies. Present plasmas have approached the ideal MHD n = 1 no-wall stability limit. Experiments are planned for the 2022 run of MAST-U to exceed this limit. Significant plasma response by resonant field amplification and entry into the regime of global MHD instability (kink/ballooning/resistive wall modes (RWM)) will be further examined. Pulse lengths will extend to 5s in the MAST-U Core Scope period and a plan for up to 10 MW total NBI heating is stated as a further enhancement to the device. The move toward a highly non-inductive plasma operational regime planned for MAST-U in later years will also be especially informative for stability forecasting studies."

Wachs, Lehigh University (Principal Investigator) S. Rangarajan, Lehigh University (Co-Investigator) Project Summary/Abstract The current shortage of high-volume propylene, which is used to produce many consumer products, has renewed interest in on purpose olefin metathesis for conversion of ethylene and 2-butene to propylene by solid supported metal oxide catalysts. An examination of the heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalysis literature, however, indicates that many key issues (e.g., role of the oxide support, anchoring sites of the metal oxides, surface coverage of the metal oxides, role of promoters. etc.) are still not fully understood. The poor state of understanding of heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalysts is a consequence of the (1) generally non-uniform nature of the surface of oxide supports that can result in multiple surface metal oxides active sites, (2) absence of in situ and operando spectrokinetic studies during calcination, catalyst activation and olefin metathesis reaction conditions, and (3) absence of theoretical studies. The objective of this proposal is to advance the fundamental molecular level understanding of olefin metathesis by supported metal oxide catalysts in order to assist in the rational design of improved heterogeneous olefin metathesis catalysts. The hypothesis of this proposal is that the MoOx anchoring sites on surface modified SiO2, modified with different oxide ligands (e.g., Al, Ti, Zr, etc.), can tune the number of activated sites and specific rates per active site (TOF) for olefin metathesis by supported MoOx on ligand SiO2 catalysts. To advance the catalysis science of the complex heterogeneous supported MoOx catalysts for olefin metathesis requires a novel comprehensive approach involving integration of molecularly designed model catalysts containing only one type of surface MoOx site coordinated to different oxide ligands (Si, Al, Zr, Ti, etc.), state-of-the-art spectroscopic in situ and operando molecular spectroscopic characterization (Infrared, Raman, Near Ambient Pressure (NAP) - X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), High Sensitivity (HS) - Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis)), kinetic studies (steady-state and transient studies (Steady-State Isotopic Transient Analysis (SSITKA), Modulation Excitation Spectroscopy (MES) and Temperature Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR)), and theoretical computations (Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Microkinetic Modeling (MKM). The new insights that will be generated by the proposed cutting-edge research will guide the rational design of improved olefin metathesis supported metal oxide catalysts and decrease formation of undesirable byproducts."

Inspired by the Urban IFL call to provide knowledge that informs equitable solutions that can strengthen community-scale resilience, we propose a people-centered, transdisciplinary IFL. BSEC begins with community priorities (human health and safety, affordable energy, transportation equity, and others) and city government priorities (clean waterways, decarbonization, functioning infrastructure) and designs observation networks and models that will deliver the climate science capable of supporting those priorities. This means that BSEC takes the form of an iterative collaborative cycle, in which an initial observation and modeling strategy is continuously updated in conversation with community partners. The guiding objective of this cycle is to produce the urban climate science needed to inform community-guided “potential equitable pathways” for climate action. In doing so, we address a number of fundamental urban science questions from across natural science and social science disciplines. BSEC focuses on Baltimore, a metropolitan area that is representative of the climate challenges faced by many mid-sized industrial cities in the United States, and in particular with eastern “rust belt” cities that face interlinked challenges of aging infrastructure, stagnant populations, increased heat and flood risk, and inequitable burdens of air and water pollution. These cities are challenging and critical places for equitable climate solutions. The BSEC Equitable Pathways approach aligns urban science with information needs through coupled cycles of model and observation improvement and participatory assessment of climate risks in the context of multiple, potentially competing priorities. Recognizing that city residents and institutions have diverse and sometimes competing goals, we place a multi-objective analysis tool at the center of our project plan. This analysis tool offers an integrating nexus to inform and challenge urban climate science with the decision needs of the residents and stakeholders who ultimately determine the success of climate action. We will deploy advanced urban environmental measurement networks combined with the best urban models available. The model-data observatory will document urban microclimate, hydrology and air quality, indoor and outdoor, with unparalleled resolution and encompass the processes that govern these critical state variables. The model improvement cycle that uses these data and models to develop the best possible urban climate modeling systems will be informed by and adapt to community needs, creating a truly community-centered urban climate observatory. Equitable climate solutions begin with community knowledge. The role of a solutions-oriented urban IFL is to amplify and enhance that knowledge, and this is only possible when there is mutual trust and respect across all project partners. The BSEC team includes collaborators from neighborhood organizations, city government, non-government community development organizations, federal environmental and research agencies, and academic researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Together, we will build a collaborative urban science framework that brings advanced measurement and observation methods into conversation with community and government deliberation on climate action. In doing so, the BSEC IFL will provide a model for community-oriented interdisciplinary urban science that advances climate solutions in Baltimore and that can be applied in many other metropolitan areas. We will also establish a new generation of urban climate scientists and urban modeling systems capable of supporting predictions and community planning across a wide range of urban areas."
"A small volume, property measurement-based, pre-screening approach for sustainable aviation fuels enabled by functional relationship development using multi-fidelity machine learning algorithms",Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023463,"Menon, Shyam",Shyam.Menon@louisianastateuniversityanda&mcollege,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Biomass-derived Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) offer a path to decarbonize emissions, reduce harmful pollution, and impact climate change. Globally, there is a growing effort to adopt SAF for commercial aviation due to sustained growth in aviation demand, lack of short to medium-term technological alternatives, and global competition for finite oil supplies as affected by market volatility and supply-chain issues. A key advantage of SAF is its ability to be synthesized from a large variety of feedstock including agricultural waste and forestry residue. This has the potential to grow regional economies while reducing the reliance on foreign oil and creating domestic jobs, particularly in rural areas. A critical hurdle, however, is the time and expense to ensure candidate fuels, particularly from emerging feedstock, can pass through the ASTM D4054 aviation fuel certification process. A current solution to this issue is adoption of pre-screening strategies to down-select viable candidate SAF fuels by ensuring similarity of their physical properties with those of conventional jet fuels. However, this strategy lacks information on the multi-variate sensitivity of combustor performance characterized by Figures of Merit (FOM) to fuel physical properties, and subsequently has significant drawbacks. Firstly, promising candidates that produce low emissions and high efficiencies may be rejected, due to such candidates possessing properties that are outside the bounds set for conventional jet fuels. Secondly, the current strategy lacks the information needed to guide SAF synthesis processes toward products offering better combustion properties than conventional jet fuels, while meeting fuel certification standards. This research focuses on the development of an improved pre-screening strategy for candidate SAF, leveraging multi-fidelity machine learning (ML) algorithms to develop functional relationships connecting fuel properties to combustor FOM relevant to aviation engines. The pre-screening strategy developed through this research will incorporate combustor metric sensitivities lacking in current approaches, facilitate model-based tuning of fuel synthesis steps, and pave the way for eventual implementation of engine-fuel co-optimization strategies. The proposed functional relationships representing merit functions for combustor metrics will be established by research tasks conducted by an interdisciplinary team from Louisiana State University (LSU) with critical partnerships to leverage specific expertise, instruments, and modeling capabilities of DOE National Laboratories, including the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). Data generated by small-volume, high-throughput fuel property measurements along with combustor FOM measurements through swirl-combustor tests and reactor network simulations will form the input to a multi-fidelity ML-framework employing Gaussian processes to determine desired functional relationships with embedded uncertainty estimates. Once generated, these functional relationships will be validated for a candidate SAF synthesized at LSU from Louisiana-native sugarcane bagasse and forestry residue. Parametric variation of synthesis process parameters through experiments and multi-physics simulations will identify those with key influence on product properties and composition. This information will be utilized for an inverse design step, whereby fuel properties as predicted by the ML framework to achieve a desired set of combustor FOM, will be used to identify and tune control knobs associated with the fuel synthesis process. The proposed work will: advance current pre-screening strategies in a way that facilitates tuning of biofuel synthesis and engine-fuel co-optimization approaches; develop innovative machine learning modeling frameworks to incorporate multi-fidelity data with uncertainty quantification and inverse design capabilities; reveal multivariate sensitivities of combustor performance to fuel properties; promote development and optimization of microwave-assisted catalysis approaches for bio-oil upgrading; and foster knowledge sharing and collaboration of LSU faculty and students with DOE National Laboratory partners to facilitate scientific breakthroughs and technological innovations."

Orlov, University of California San Diego (Co-Investigator) This project extends the predictive capabilities of non-axisymmetric (3D) field physics with integrated scenario optimizations to demonstrate the scientific feasibility of 3D magnetic perturbations for transport and instability control in long-pulse high-performance tokamak plasmas. A key example of this is the suppression of the edge-localized-modes (ELMs) by resonant 3D magnetic perturbations (RMPs). ELMs constitute a major challenge to the operation of fusion-grade tokamak plasmas such as ITER due to the large transient heat loads they deliver to plasma facing components (PFCs). US scientists have pioneered the development of the 3D-field approach to ELM control since its first discovery and have a crucial role in exporting the technique to international facilities such as the KSTAR tokamak in Korea, the EAST tokamak in China, and the AUG tokamak in Germany. Recent international collaborations have enabled the project team to compile comprehensive 3D databases, develop testable criteria for the accessibility and threshold conditions of ELM suppression, improve understanding of underlying particle transport for predicting pedestal profile modifications and heat flux to PFCs, and adaptively control 3D fields to restore confinement under ELM suppression. These recent accomplishments have exposed opportunities for the US scientists to resolve remaining challenges, such as the compatibility of 3D ELM suppression with core optimized scenarios as well as heat loads to PFCs for long pulses. Enhanced physics models, databases, and experimental analysis infrastructures developed by this project team will be all leveraged utilizing the strong partnerships among the multi-institutional US groups and international collaborators. Predictive capabilities for 3D edge perturbations, transport, and ELM suppression will be validated over international databases with analysis utilizing US cutting-edge 3D simulations. Intelligent control algorithms for the 3D field operational windows and associated profile alterations will be developed and integrated into TRANSP for long pulse optimization. This novel ‘3D TRANSP’ will be tested and refined on KSTAR with the new tungsten divertors, in preparation for ITER applications. In parallel, the 3D field physics basis will be extended to optimize fast ion losses and heat flux to divertors. Understanding of turbulent transport across 3D magnetic topologies including edge and core island chains as well as stochastic field lines will also be extended. All these developments will be integrated to establish optimized long pulse scenarios with 3D fields in KSTAR. The predictive 3D scenario optimizations will be then combined with real-time, actively probing, adaptive controllers to demonstrate ELM-free H-mode scenarios in KSTAR for long pulses of up to 300s with ??N>2.0, minimal core MHD, maximized confinement, and minimized heat loads to plasma facing components."

The mission of CEDARS is an integrated theory-experiment approach to reveal step-by-step the mechanism behind the water splitting reaction that produces hydrogen fuel. In so doing, CEDARS will reveal the formation of the intermediates of the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions, what causes the O-O and H-H bonds to form, and identify the role of the catalyst in these processes. We will follow how a catalyst transforms water molecules by the electron and proton transfers at a solid-liquid interface that obscures them and at a trillionth of a second time resolution. We will then follow how these transient intermediates initiate the formation of chemical bonds, and finally trigger the release of hydrogen and oxygen. CEDARS takes a unique route that focuses on mission-oriented basic science by combining atomically precise materials growth with studies of the shortest-lived transient intermediates by optical and X-ray spectroscopy, and first-principles modeling inclusive of beyond density functional theory (DFT) methods. At CEDARS, advanced materials are seen as an enabling tool, where the power of advanced spectroscopy techniques is amplified to delineate the mechanism of water splitting. The research thrusts of CEDARS are: Thrust I-Initial surface intermediates on electron-driven catalytic surfaces, Thrust II- Bond Formation from surface intermediates, Thrust III-Corrosion and the activity-stability relationship.

This is inspired by much of the work this team recently uncovered on novel Group IV alloy semiconductor materials, demonstrating that short-range order of Ge and Sn atoms on the periodic lattice of GeSn has a very large effect on the electronic energy band gap. This discovery motivates the manipulation and ordering of nearest neighbor atoms with atomic precision to intentionally co-design specific material properties and discover new and novel science. The outcome is potentially a knowledge base and tool that utilizes spatial arrangements of atoms of all types to fabricate novel heterostructures and graded morphologies made of seamless heterogeneous interfaces, using one material, solely one composition, the very same atoms, purposely ordered differently to form a specific structure. It presents an opportunity for a low-loss, low-cost microelectronic technology, leveraging a fundamental understanding of the underlying physics of the ordering of atoms in crystals, for new science on a silicon platform, such as: (i) lateral and vertical ordering of atoms that alone make transistors and corresponding photonic devices that can revolutionize data transfer rates; (ii) different configurations of atoms that can be switched from one to the other as memory elements drastically increasing speed and energy efficiency in computers; (iii) ordering of atoms for low-loss electrical transport; (iv) domains of different types of ordering of atoms that create new opportunities for heat to electricity conversion; and (v) fabrication of never seen before arrangement of atoms, using growth and scanning tunneling microscopy, that gives rise to exciting and new material properties and device concepts. This center will investigate and achieve the manipulation of short-range ordering of atoms in Group IV semiconductor alloys as a new tool for design and fabrication of semiconductor properties relevant for next-generation microelectronics. The µ-ATOMS center approach is to merge the team’s knowledge and expertise at the frontier of Group IV science through several thrusts covering (i) modeling, (ii) growth and fabrication, and (iii) characterization, – all integrated into the crosscutting thrust (iv) to produce ordered structures that test and validate the ideas and results in thrusts (i) to (iii), while also training the next generation diverse workforce on innovation in semiconductor science and technology. This will create new technological opportunities for co-designed spatial short-range order of atoms for specific electronic properties.

Such materials provide control over local environments afforded through synthesis, long-lived charge carrier lifetimes, and flexible, low-cost, scalable thin film formats which circumvent the shortcomings of inorganic materials. Investigations of p-conjugated polymer interfaces have been mainly restricted to optoelectronic devices with key knowledge gaps remaining in understanding and controlling polymer/electrolyte interfaces. An EFRC effort is required that encompasses new measurement science to explore p-conjugated polymer materials and interfaces in operando conditions (under stress away from equilibrium), new theoretical approaches to modeling energetics and charge transport in polymer/electrolyte interphase regions, as well as new p-conjugated polymer materials that will be durable within these real-world conditions. The SPECS team of proven, diverse, and engaged researchers includes spectroscopy, materials science, polymer physics, synthetic chemistry, and computational chemistry that will achieve this mission, working across three interconnected Thrusts – 1) Hybrid Electrical Ionic Charge Transport; 2) Charge Transfer and Energy Cascades; 3) Durability. Through these Thrusts, we will address the knowledge gaps involving both dark and photo-driven Faradaic and capacitive electrolytic processes in soft materials, since current models of charge transfer at inorganic semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces do not translate to soft-material/electrolyte interfaces. Outcomes of SPECS will include mechanistic insights and new physiochemical models of fundamental structure-property relationships. Rather than empirical correlations, SPECS will advance models based on fundamental chemistry to drive the search for anode and cathode materials at electrochemically reactive interfaces (catalysis) and buried atomic-to-nano interfaces that comprise the bulk (storage). The SPECS team possesses an unusually broad spectrum of measurement science capabilities that provides for characterization of both static and dynamic structures of soft materials and their interfaces with electrolytes (X-ray, neutron scattering), as well as visible and near-IR transient, macroscopic and nanometer-scale spectroscopic and unique spectroelectrochemical approaches to characterization of charge formation and transport, that underpin the efforts in all three Thrust areas. Due to the inherent interdisciplinary nature of studies of soft interfaces and the dynamic responses of local p-conjugated polymer/electrolyte interfaces that contribute to volumetric behavior, SPECS naturally sits at the intersection of multiple DOE initiatives and programs.

This cost reduction can be achieved via two approaches: 1) developing less expensive components or 2) by increasing battery lifetime. This program focusses on the latter by developing novel battery materials with extreme durability that exhibit greatly enhanced ion and electron transport characteristics. To this end, we will investigate Wadsley-Roth (WR) niobates, a family of complex crystal structures with excellent ion and electron transport that each occur along distinct crystalline regions and which have set new charge storage performance records. Recent examples have shown the potential of controlled defects to further enhance transport in this class of materials. There is, however, a knowledge gap in understanding the connections between composition, disorder, and defects upon these transport mechanisms. This program addresses the challenges of improving transport characteristics two ways: first the discovery of new equilibrium WR phases and second studying how non-equilibrium defects can enhance transport. To realize novel intercalation materials with sufficiently high ionic and electronic conductivities that enable durable batteries, our multifaceted and integrative team will use an inverse design strategy where machine learning accelerates experimental work by identifying promising new WR compositions. Diverse synthetic methods will realize these predicted phases with diverse defect structures that may enable novel transport mechanisms. The inclusion of comprehensive atomic scale and nanoscale structure characterizations as well as systematic transport measurements will enable multiscale transport modeling that connects transport characteristics to the underlying defect chemistries. From this information, key chemical and structural descriptors will be identified, modeled, and further investigated. The outcome will be the foundational knowledge required to develop new intercalation materials that display exceptional conductivities to enable more durable and energy efficient batteries. This class of materials also promises remarkably high energy densities with fast charge capabilities and have potential to impact major battery applications spanning from grid-level to portable electronics and electric vehicles."

Recent studies show that nitrogen input from N-fertilizer synthesis and river runoff will pose a serious and growing problem with intensifying climate change. Excessive fertilization also leads to the release of considerable amounts of nitrous oxide into the atmosphere posing additional aggravating challenges to the bioenergy balance of modern society. To address these major societal challenges, improvements to today’s agricultural strategies are necessary. Here we aim to develop a new, non-invasive quantum sensing approach to directly observe metabolic transformation in the rhizosphere to acquire currently inaccessible knowledge. We propose a quantum spin technology to image biochemical pathways in the rhizosphere with unprecedented chemical detail and sensitivity. Specifically, the proposed technology transfers the quantum entangled nuclear spin order of hydrogen gas, to metabolites, including nitrate, amino acids and pyruvate, to enable molecular imaging of their metabolic transformations without any penetration depth limitations such that molecular turnover and metabolism can be observed directly in soil. We will conduct proof-of-concept demonstrations of our quantum sensing approach to study nitrogen assimilation of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula). M. truncatula is a model legume for biological nitrogen fixation mediated by rhizobia and symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi which transport nutrients, including nitrate, to the plant. In return, rhizobia and AM fungi receive fixed carbon from the plant. However, there is no technology to date that can track individual metabolic events non-invasively in unperturbed soil to answer some of the most important questions about which metabolic pathways the molecules actually follow. After establishing this new quantum sensing approach to molecular imaging on roots, it can be applied to any plant of interest to study their molecular machinery. Current technology designed to non-invasively monitor the metabolic turnover of naturally occurring biomolecules in plants, roots or smaller model systems faces major obstacles. In case of optical techniques, obstacles include optical penetration depth limitations and chemical specificity. In contrast to optical techniques, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are well-established non-invasive techniques that easily report on small changes in chemical structure and perform non-invasive imaging. However, NMR, and even more so MRI, are notoriously insensitive, require large samples and high concentrations, therefore the study of low-concentration metabolites remains out of reach. With quantum entangled sources of nuclear spin order, parahydrogen in particular, we overcome current technological shortcomings and achieve sensitivity gains of up to seven orders of magnitude, which promise tracking of low concentration metabolites and their chemical transformations deep inside soil. With succesfull completion of our aims we will have established a new quantum technology for non-invasive imaging of nitrogen assimilation in the rhizosphere. This implies that the same technology can be used to understand many other metabolic pathways that are not easily accessible today. Ultimately, this technology will help produce crops that increase carbon uptake in soil, helping to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and decreasing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions."

In consequence, whatever shapes soil microbial activity shapes the world. Substantial recent work in environmental microbiology has taught us that viruses are a key driver of microbial ecology in other systems, and we expect the same to hold true in soil. But soil is a complex milieu – highly structured, chemically and physically heterogenous, and resistant to extrapolation. Thus, even as new methods have revolutionized our understanding of microbial and viral ecology in other systems, our understanding of soil microbial ecology has lagged, and our understanding of soil viral ecology is still further behind. Even less well understood are mobile genetic elements (MGEs), virtually unexplored in soils, but known to be agents of rapid genomic change elsewhere. Our objective is to develop paradigms for understanding the role of viruses and MGEs in soil ecology via genomics of natural communities and experiments of laboratory model systems, and to build tools – scalable new methods, new databases, and new model systems – to test these paradigms. In developing paradigms for soil viral ecology, we will focus intensively on one system, a permafrost thaw gradient at Stordalen Mire was the focus of the DOE-funded IsoGenie Consortium for nearly a decade, though with only DNA viruses studied (albeit using now outdated methods) and no investigation of RNA viruses or MGEs. In Aim 1, we leverage existing IsoGenie datasets and soil samples to (i) apply current ‘virome’ approaches to identify, quantify and characterize all types of viruses and MGEs from new data streams and in their microbiome context, (ii) track carbon transformations and temperature responses of viruses and MGEs in experiments, and (iii) apply such methods to 2 other DOE-funded sites to assess universalities. Aim 2 seeks to establish mechanistic understanding of soil phage-microbe interactions. This will involve generating time-resolved multi-omics datasets from our new soil phage-host model systems and using these to qualitatively assess metabolic reprogramming in virus-infected cells (Virocells), a major knowledge gap in our understanding of viral ecosystem impacts. We will also assess these soil phage-host model systems using scalable genetics methods to establish large-scale understanding of how soil cells become resistant to phages. We will test hypotheses arising from these genome-wide screens by phage genome engineering to assess the lesser-studied phage components of the phage-host evolutionary arms race in soils. Aim 3 seeks to provide foundational resources that will broadly help soil viral and microbial ecologists seeking to use systems biology approaches in these complex systems. First, we will attempt to adapt new ‘oceans’ methods to soils to enable high-throughput virus capture and characterization (viral tag and grow) and targeted assessment of RNA viruses (via RNA viral particle purification and sequencing). Second, towards resource development, we seek to develop experimental systems specific to Stordalen Mire for future hypothesis testing, as well as work with DOE KBase in community organization efforts to build a centralized and curated online resource for viral genomics, proteomics, and taxonomy. Finally, we will hold a “soil virus” workshop as a forum to cross-train in the methods we and others have developed that could be beneficial to BER-relevant soil systems. Together, this proposed work should transform soil viral ecology as a field, and with it our understanding of viruses, MGEs, and the soil microbiome as drivers of global biogeochemistry."
Intelligent File System Interfaces for Computational Storage Devices,Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research,DE-SC0023186,"Kandemir, Mahmut",Mahmut.Kandemir@thepennsylvaniastateuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Computational Storage Interfaces for HPC Applications Mahmut Kandemir, The Pennsylvania State University (Principal Investigator) Abutalib Aghayev, The Pennsylvania State University (Co-Investigator) The overarching goal of this project is to enable computational storage in the context of large-scale HPC applications that employ data analytics. To achieve this goal, we expose computational storage devices (CSDs) to software, design novel file system interfaces that can take advantage of CSDs, and implement computational storage-specific optimizations in a publicly-available parallel file system to minimize data movements between host machine and CSDs as well as among CSDs themselves. While the hardware employed in HPC datacenters have witnessed significant strides over the last few decades, the “physical separation” of computation (performed in CPUs and GPUs) from data (stored in HDDs and SSDs) is becoming an increasingly performance-limiting factor due to the excessive data movement costs it entails. Thus, there is a motivation for HPC systems to embrace new technologies, storage systems, and software frameworks to minimize data movement costs. One such promising technology posed to reduce data movement costs is computational storage, which is a full-fledged compute platform that includes compute elements, memory, and storage as well as system software put into an SSD. It is important to emphasize that computational storage enables what can be termed as Near-Data Computation, i.e., performing computation “near storage” instead of the conventional approach of bringing data to where computation is scheduled (host CPUs and GPUs). This project has five complementary thrusts: - Thrust-I: Exposing CSDs to Parallel File System and Application Programs. We expose CSDs to software stack via suitable hardware abstractions. The rationale for this is to be able to treat CSDs as “first-class compute engines” just like CPUs and GPUs in an HPC datacenter. - Thrust-II: Novel File System Interfaces. We explore three types of new interfaces specifically designed for CSDs. The prescriptive interface gives the user explicit control in deciding where (host or CSDs) to execute offloaded functions and where to store the resulting data. In contrast, descriptive interface lets the file system decide the location of offloaded computations and the result data and performs various CSD-specific optimizations automatically. Finally, predictive interface allows select functions to execute on CSDs speculatively. - Thrust-III: Metadata Enrichment: We augment conventional parallel file system metadata with CSD-specific metadata to enable our optimizations. Our new metadata include characteristics of the functions offloaded to CSDs as well as performance metadata to keep track of function invocation/data access frequencies and affinity across functions. - Thrust-IV: CSD-specific Optimizations. We investigate CSD-specific file system optimizations. The primary goal of these optimizations is to minimize data movements while ensuring as much parallel execution on CSDs as possible. Our CSD-specific optimizations include, but not limited to, (i) performing data parallel computation on CSDs; (ii) deciding the ideal CSDs to execute a given offloaded function and deciding the ideal CSDs to store the resulting data; (iii) optimized execution of predictive calls; (iv) proactive data migration across CSDs; and (v) scheduling offloaded functions on limited resources in CSDs. - Thrust-V: Implementation, Evaluation, and Benchmarking. We implement our techniques in Lustre and test their effectiveness using a variety of HPC workloads and different types of CSDs. We build a CSD emulator using SPDK for driving the initial stages of our research. We maintain a public repository that includes the source codes for our CSD emulator and our patches to Lustre, as well as detailed experimental results. Our project is expected to (i) reduce “distance-to-data” for analytics functions/kernels employed in HPC domain, and (ii) relieve the host CPUs and GPUs from the tasks of executing such analytics functions/kernels, i.e., it will free these resources for simulation alone. As a result, the application performance is expected to improve and the energy footprint of HPC datacenters will also reduce."

The traditional multi-step lithography-based approach for manufacturing THz filters is expensive and limited to diameters of 30 cm. However, lower cost, high quality THz filters of arbitrary size are required for many applications, including the CMB-S4 program. The proposed technology is a rapid, low-cost fabrication method for multi-layer, metal-mesh THz filters that will produce these filters using a direct-write approach at a lower cost, in higher volumes, and with arbitrarily large diameters. The Phase I project experimentally demonstrated that this new fabrication technology has the ability to create the microstructures necessary for these filters and demonstrated a single-layer THz filter during the project. The fabrication technology can also create other structures, similar to the microstructures in THz filters, that are desired by potential industrial customers. The Phase II project will develop a complete large-area, nano-laser-ablation tool for filters along with supporting capabilities of filter design and testing to provide custom fabricated multi-level metal mesh filters for a variety of THz applications. Commercial applications for the proposed high-performance filters include THz imaging, spectroscopy, and wireless communications. These applications would benefit industries such as medicine, homeland security and defense, consumer devices, food safety, non-destructive evaluation for manufacturing, and scientific research. The nano-ablation capability will also be broadly useful as a rapid microfabrication tool that would be useful in microsystems, optics, integrated circuits, and circuit board production."

Advanced materials with high performance properties hold the key for thermal straps, effectively balancing device heat dissipation with cryocooler capacity, and reducing conduction cooling time, enabling faster operation. Space platforms and high-power electronic systems require next-generation high thermal and electrical conductivity materials for fast conduction cooling and/or low resistance electrical pathways. This project will develop and validate an efficient, scalable, manufacturing-ready approach for production of high-performance graphene-copper hybrid foils/coatings, and demonstrate their application in thermal straps, electronic devices, and space landing systems. This technology utilizes the intrinsic physiochemical, thermal, and mechanical properties of graphene and copper matrix, combined with advanced electrodeposition techniques for hybrid material fabrication. This technology can tailor graphene-copper hybrid properties for operational performance, making the hybrid material an ideal thermal strap or coating for fast conduction cooling processes and/or low electrical resistance requirements. Manufacturing processes to fabricate graphene-copper hybrid foils were developed. Fabricated hybrid foils exhibited ~50% sheet resistance reduction and ~50% mechanical strain increase compared to pure copper foils. Thermal conductivity, measured by the stepped-bar method, increased with the incorporation of graphene in the copper matrix, adjusted for surface roughness. Government users and commercial partners were identified. Phase II will mature and scale the production of graphene-copper hybrid foils with both incorporated and laminate structures. The graphene-copper hybrid foils will be assembled into thermal straps for SRF cavities and cryocoolers. The performance of individual foils and assembled thermal straps will be evaluated. The hybrid foil manufacturing parameters will be customized based on both DOE applications in thermal straps and identified commercial applications in electronics, and space systems. The cost analysis will be refined, and a technology transfer plan and business case based on the commercial interests of our partners will be further developed. Copper-graphene hybrid materials are of interest to entities with advanced thermal management needs using conduction cooling, including NASA and Air Force. The proposed technology is anticipated to attract interest from markets for high-powered electronics and space landing systems, which use conduction cooling technology for heat transfer or high conductivity backplanes as low resistance electrical pathways."

Several factors such as thermodynamic constraints and structural compatibility have been implicated in electron transfer insulation (ETI). Most of our understanding of how these factors contribute to ETI has involved in vitro analysis. This analysis is extremely valuable, but it cannot replicate the dynamic cellular environment. In such a dynamic environment, the concentration of electron transfer components and their substrates may change, and multiple pathways may compete for a pool of reducing power, making it difficult to predict or exploit ETI in both natural and designed electron flow. Our research problem addresses this area because it will uncover determinants of ETI that control electron flow to nitrogen fixation in the anaerobic, phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Nitrogen fixation is a focus because, along with ammonia, this process produces the energy-rich compounds hydrogen gas and, in some cases, methane. During the previous funding period, we found we could connect the electron transfer pathway from one metabolic module to power electron transfer to nitrogenase. In so doing, we uncovered evidence for ETI between metabolic pathways that could be overcome with only two mutations, one in a gene encoding a novel enzyme predicted to carry out electron bifurcation and the other in a gene encoding a ferredoxin that interacts with nitrogenase. In the current funding period, ETI in R. palustris will be investigated through the following aims using both biochemical and genetic approaches: Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that changes in the protein sequence of a novel Nfn-like protein disrupt ETI by affecting protein abundance and/or activity with a specific Fd. Aim 2. To determine the contribution of ferredoxin reduction potential and surface charge in determining ETI in R. palustris. Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that ETI is influenced by environmental factors that regulate electron transfer pathway availability and activity. This work has the potential to provide insight into mechanisms that control electron flow in a dynamic cellular environment and how new electron transfer connections can be made to tap into energy-conserving pathways."

Chemical manufacturing alone accounts for 10% of total global energy consumption and is responsible for 7% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuels remain the most widely employed source of energy to generate the high temperatures and pressures required to manufacture desired products. The use of carbon-neutral sources of energy could have tremendous impact at global scale in reducing the chemical manufacturing industry’s carbon footprint. Fossil fuels are often also the precursors to starting materials for the production of everyday chemicals. Transformation of abundant biomass or waste to feedstock chemicals could alleviate the need for non-renewable sources. Solar energy is an attractive alternative to power from fossil fuels, as it is carbon-neutral, essentially inexhaustible, and enough solar energy to power all of humanity’s needs for an entire year reaches the earth every hour. The key difficulty is not the lack of energy, but the means to convert this power into useful energy. Solar energy can be converted to chemical energy when used to excite light-absorbing catalysts and take the place of thermal energy in chemical syntheses in a manner akin to that of photosynthesis. “Photoredox catalysis” has been mostly employed in the synthesis of small molecules, such as pharmaceuticals and perfumes, but has yet to be translated into mass production of feedstock chemicals or their valorization at large scale. Since launching in August 2018, BioLEC has made significant advances in understanding what drives photoredox catalysis at a mechanistic level, worked to create new and more potent photocatalysts using biological systems and mechanistic insights as inspiration, and harnessed and amplified the power of photocatalysis for new energy-relevant applications. The BioLEC team brings together expertise in multiple fields to enable innovative approaches to understand and advance the capabilities of photocatalysis. A wide variety of spectroscopists – using methods that are both standard or developed within BioLEC for our purposes – work with organic chemists and biochemists to reveal the mechanisms underlying photocatalysis. Using this information, coupled with theoretical and computational studies, insights and tools from biological systems, and engineering methods, the team develop groundbreaking approaches to improve and transform catalysis with light. Simultaneously, they generate new ways to deploy photocatalytic transformations and the advances generated, revealing the power of this approach for tackling real world issues such as recycling and reducing dependence on fossil fuels for power and raw materials. The impacts of BioLEC’s work are manifold, from scientific advances that push forward the fields of photocatalysis, biocatalysis, spectroscopic methods and theory, but also for the environment and industry. Already, the center has created methods to recycle previously intractable plastics, produced new spectroscopic methods that can be deployed widely to answer a multitude of scientific questions, and revealed mechanisms in photocatalysis that researchers in the wider field are now using to improve reactions. Future work in the Center aims to develop innovative photochemistry that enables new routes for synthesizing chemical feedstocks; discover, synthesize, and study photoenzymes that enable enhanced catalysis; and inform design of photocatalysts by elucidating photocatalysis mechanisms."

Yet predicting the voltage-dependent stability and transient response of solid–liquid interfaces over relevant length and time scales remains an outstanding challenge. In response to this fundamental challenge, the goal of this project is to implement and further develop large-scale computational models based on voltage-dependent electronic-structure methods and charge-optimized many-body potentials for simulating electrochemical interfaces under applied bias. The focus is on predicting the electrochemical durability of platinum-based bimetallic electrodes against metal migration and metal dissolution under oxidizing conditions. Guided by the hypothesis that the adsorption of oxygenated species exerts primary control on the electrochemical stability of bimetallic alloys, we will predict and analyze the voltage-driven mechanisms by which these electrocatalysts degrade in aqueous media across length and time scales. This research is directly connected to three synergistic research themes of the BES Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences Division: ‘Chemistry at Complex Interfaces’, ‘Chemistry in Aqueous Environments’, and ‘Charge Transport and Reactivity’. The anticipated broad benefit of this project is to advance computational capabilities for modeling solid–liquid interfaces under voltage and for predicting the charge capacity and redox activity of electrochemical systems, including but not limited to hydrogen fuel cells, metal–air batteries, and water-splitting electrolyzers."

The use of few cycle pulses is anticipated to elucidate the role of ultrafast instabilities while also enhancing desired beam properties, as well as demonstrating increases in on-target laser intensity without the need for additional costly amplifiers. In the prior twenty years, a rapid increase in high intensity capabilities has occurred in peak target intensity, energy delivered to target, repetition rate, beam quality, and peak power. However, one parameter which has been relatively constant in these experiments is the pulse duration, held at tens of femtoseconds corresponding to tens of laser cycles. There are numerous demonstratable impacts from relativistic, many cycle drivers, some which are well known and some currently unknown. Recent simulation results suggest that the use of single cycles can dramatically increase the maximum ion energy in laser ion acceleration with thin targets. We also recently demonstrated that a Rayleigh Taylor like instability can dramatically increase laser absorption in nanometer thickness solid density plasmas, preventing higher energies from being achieved in laser ion acceleration. The generation of relativistically intense few cycle laser pulses will use a compression after compressor approach. We recently demonstrated the use of thin dielectric plates as a means of generating relativistically intense laser pulses, which are both highly focusable yet also several femtoseconds in duration. We also demonstrated the ability to generate significant spectrum while maintaining focusability on petawatt laser systems. However, the lack of suitable dispersion correcting optics at large diameters prevents the compression of such large diameter beams. In this Proposal, we will undergo an experimental campaign to generate high energy, femtosecond few cycle pulses in which we use plasma as a compression medium. Utilizing 3D printed gas cells to tailor the density profiles, we will extend our prior compression work on millijoule laser systems onto LaserNetUS facilities, potentially including Scarlett, Diocles, ALEPH, and the ALLS. In our first year, we will develop a scaled plasma compression scheme at UCI utilizing a high repetition commercial laser system. In year 2, we will demonstrate simultaneous focusability and sub-10 femtosecond pulse durations on a LaserNetUS facility. In year 3, we anticipate being able to perform few cycle laser wakefield accelerator experiments at a LaserNetUS facility. This proposal will fund two graduate, who will both be exposed to extensive training across high energy density physics in both simulations and experimental capabilities. The successful completion of this project will enable a new regime in high energy density physics, and the potential realization of multiple laser ion acceleration mechanism. It is anticipated that the modular pulse compression capabilities developed through this proposal will be able to be made available throughout the LaserNetUS infrastructure."

Inspired by the Urban IFL call to provide knowledge that informs equitable solutions that can strengthen community-scale resilience, we propose a people-centered, transdisciplinary IFL. BSEC begins with community priorities (human health and safety, affordable energy, transportation equity, and others) and city government priorities (clean waterways, decarbonization, functioning infrastructure) and designs observation networks and models that will deliver the climate science capable of supporting those priorities. This means that BSEC takes the form of an iterative collaborative cycle, in which an initial observation and modeling strategy is continuously updated in conversation with community partners. The guiding objective of this cycle is to produce the urban climate science needed to inform community-guided “potential equitable pathways” for climate action. In doing so, we address a number of fundamental urban science questions from across natural science and social science disciplines. BSEC focuses on Baltimore, a metropolitan area that is representative of the climate challenges faced by many mid-sized industrial cities in the United States, and in particular with eastern “rust belt” cities that face interlinked challenges of aging infrastructure, stagnant populations, increased heat and flood risk, and inequitable burdens of air and water pollution. These cities are challenging and critical places for equitable climate solutions. The BSEC Equitable Pathways approach aligns urban science with information needs through coupled cycles of model and observation improvement and participatory assessment of climate risks in the context of multiple, potentially competing priorities. Recognizing that city residents and institutions have diverse and sometimes competing goals, we place a multi-objective analysis tool at the center of our project plan. This analysis tool offers an integrating nexus to inform and challenge urban climate science with the decision needs of the residents and stakeholders who ultimately determine the success of climate action. We will deploy advanced urban environmental measurement networks combined with the best urban models available. The model-data observatory will document urban microclimate, hydrology and air quality, indoor and outdoor, with unparalleled resolution and encompass the processes that govern these critical state variables. The model improvement cycle that uses these data and models to develop the best possible urban climate modeling systems will be informed by and adapt to community needs, creating a truly community-centered urban climate observatory. Equitable climate solutions begin with community knowledge. The role of a solutions-oriented urban IFL is to amplify and enhance that knowledge, and this is only possible when there is mutual trust and respect across all project partners. The BSEC team includes collaborators from neighborhood organizations, city government, non-government community development organizations, federal environmental and research agencies, and academic researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Together, we will build a collaborative urban science framework that brings advanced measurement and observation methods into conversation with community and government deliberation on climate action. In doing so, the BSEC IFL will provide a model for community-oriented interdisciplinary urban science that advances climate solutions in Baltimore and that can be applied in many other metropolitan areas. We will also establish a new generation of urban climate scientists and urban modeling systems capable of supporting predictions and community planning across a wide range of urban areas."

UCLA currently operates two diagnostics on LTX-ß: a mm-wave interferometer system and a fast electron density profile reflectometer system. UCLA will upgrade the interferometer to a low-k scattering system to measure density fluctuations in the frequency range 0-500 kHz (this is in addition to its base interferometry function). This scattering function will not affect the diagnostic’s operation as an interferometer. In addition, a new tunable density fluctuation reflectometer system is near completion and is planned to be operational in late FY22. It should be noted that the low-k scattering system and the fluctuation reflectometer described here are the only internal measurements of turbulence and mode activity on LTX-ß (magnetics and Langmuir probes are at the edge plasma or external). These diagnostics will therefore provide critical insight into these physics processes. For reference, a listing of the project objectives is shown below. Project Objectives (1) Lead and collaborate in state-of-the-art turbulence and transport experiments in support of both the US fusion energy research program and the LTX-ß research program. (2) Continue to operate a density profile reflectometer and a mm-wave interferometer on LTX-ß for high time resolution density profiles and chord averaged electron densities. These are essential diagnostics for LTX-ß transport and confinement studies. (3) Install and operate a tunable density fluctuation reflectometer system. (4) Upgrade the current interferometer phase measurement to address unwanted phase jumps observed on LTX-ß interferometer data. UCLA will examine several approaches to this upgrade including an improved phase comparator, a fully heterodyne upgrade, improved software analysis, or other enhancements. This will be followed by fabrication, testing, and installation. (5) The interferometer will also be configured as a low-k forward scattering system for density turbulence and coherent mode detection. This low-k scattering configuration does not interfere with the base interferometer operation.

This mission requires innovation in the development of improved data-driven and model-based approaches that maximize plasma performance in existing experiments (with focus on the DIII-D facility) with impact on optimizing operational scenarios. The focus of the research and development in this proposal is to efficiently integrate an improved version of the artificial intelligence (AI) enabled deep learning FRNN prediction and control software into the DIII-D PCS for planning realistic real-time strategies embedded in control software that can improve the plasma performance in DIII-D with relevance for the burning plasma ITER facility. The R&D proposed here will further develop the successful AI/Deep-learning (DL) fusion recurrent neural network (FRNN) software beyond the disruption forecasting capability to now include a real-time-capable first-principles based simulator (SGTC) described in the following. We will be guided by a proper implementation of FRNN within a proximity control architecture designed to identify and predict the major causes of disruptions [Barr2021] that involves active engagement & collaboration with the DIII-D Plasma Control Group. Through the convergence between AI/DL and model simulations via high performance computing (HPC), the proposed new AI/DL capability can provide not only the “disruption score,” as an indicator of the probability of an imminent disruption, but also a “sensitivity score” in real-time to indicate the underlying reasons for the predicted disruption. The overarching aim here is to demonstrate that real-time modification of the plasma state can lead to a more favorable thermodynamic one to avoid or delay the onset of disruptions. In order to systematically progress toward our stated goal, a key AI/DL (artificial intelligence/deep learning) software challenge is to build a modern high-performance computing (HPC) enabled synthetic plasma simulator that is capable of carrying out HPC-driven real-time plasma control applications. This involves development of a deep learning framework to train a surrogate model to enable accurate first-principles-based instability analysis – i.e., a simulator (SGTC) derived from the global electromagnetic gyrokinetic code GTC [Lin1998]. Overall, the integration of the latest version of the FRNN prediction and control software will include the further development and application of the pre-trained surrogate model (SGTC) that is benchmarked against HPC results from the well-established electromagnetic GTC code. Moreover, our focus on experimentally measured signals will include ECEI and the development of a synthetic ECEI interface for associated GTC HPC simulation results (i.e., “SGTC-ECEI”). The mission here is to provide inference at a time-scale relevant for real-time applications. The specific role of SGTC is to provide additional accurate and detailed plasma instability information for real-time plasma control beyond the capability of conventional machine learning approaches focusing only on measured signals. These tools will enable accelerated progress toward the realization of a realistic plasma state simulator that can be directly implemented into the DIII-D PCS to guide real-time control. In summary, realistic additional first-principles-based information from SGTC combined with the predictive power of FRNN will collectively provide timely warning of oncoming disruptions, together with actionable information on instability properties that can be used to inform a specific, targeted actuation strategy. This proposal thus describes a collaborative path with DIII-D towards an AI-powered real-time predictive plasma control and actuation strategy with the goal of proactively avoiding disruptive instabilities while maximizing plasma performance."

The changing climate is having an unprecedented impact on society and the natural environment, where more extreme weather events are rapidly evolving such as intensified hurricanes that are decimating coastal communities, mammoth wildfires that are wiping out entire towns, and polar vortexes that are causing collapse of energy grids across entire states. One approach that is being actively pursued to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations is direct air capture (DAC); however, this approach is currently cost prohibitive using existing technologies due to the challenges of removing dilute amounts of CO2 from air, part of which is attributed to the large energy demands of sorbent regeneration. Thus, fundamental research is required to create new sorbent materials and explore novel methods of regeneration. This project seeks to combat the cost and energy limitations of DAC by developing a novel solid sorbent that is actively controlled by an applied electric field during CO2 capture and material regeneration. By utilizing abundant, inexpensive materials for synthesis of the Ca-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) sorbent, the overall cost is reduced, and the use of renewable electricity has the potential to significantly reduce energy demands for material regeneration. The objectives of this project are to: (i) uncover the fundamental chemical processes controlling CO2 capture and release on Ca-based LDH from dilute CO2 sources, and the impact of water vapor, (ii) explore how low-temperature plasma (LTP)-generated electric fields affect these chemical processes, (iii) augment capture behavior by tailoring the chemical composition and associated electron density of the LDH, and (iv) determine the viability of electric field-controlled CO2 release as a means of material regeneration. This project will utilize a synergistic simulation-experiment approach that exploits the predictive power of atomistic simulations with operando X-ray and neutron scattering, and spectroscopy techniques. These high-fidelity simulations will exploit DOE high performance computing resources, while operando experiments will be performed at DOE synchrotron and neutron facilities. These approaches will be complemented by findings from plasma diagnostic tools, and downstream gas phase composition from mass spectrometry. The potential impact of this project centers on the use of high-voltage electric fields generated by low-temperature plasmas for enhancing DAC, and thus will contribute to increasing its technological feasibility and economic viability. Due to the increase of renewable electricity production in the U.S. and associated intermittency, the use of low-temperature plasmas for CO2 capture provides an ideal solution that will actively utilize excess electrons during peak production periods."

Consequently, it is imperative to replace these critical materials with more abundant materials such as copper, iron, nickel, or cobalt in these energy applications. Replacing PGE with more sustainable metals is a non-trivial challenge, in part because making materials with these other compositions requires disruptively different synthetic approaches than those used for PGE. This proposal addresses a significant fundamental knowledge gap in the synthesis of non-PGE nanoparticles with well-defined shapes. Building mechanistic understanding in this area is crucial to the establishment of catalytic structure-activity relationships that will enable non-PGE to replace and reduce the use of PGE in these important applications. The integrated electrochemical approach to be employed in this work introduces unique flexibility in synthetic design that will enable both enhanced fundamental insight into non-PGE metal nanoparticle growth mechanisms and the development of innovative synthesis approaches that move beyond the classic conditions employed in the field. Using real-time electrochemical measurements, our integrated approach allows us to define desired parameters for the selection of novel reaction conditions for nanoparticle synthesis, thus breaking the boundaries of literature precedent. In addition, we will probe the mechanistic roles of components such as surfactants and shape-directing agents in ways that are not possible using colloidal synthesis development approaches, providing a more complete understanding of the critically important role of these additives in colloidal growth. Finally, our electrochemical synthesis makes it possible to precisely tune the reaction conditions at each step of nanoparticle growth while also providing real-time insight into the impact of changing reaction conditions. It is thus a powerful tool for the precision design and implementation of nanoparticle syntheses that control the dynamics of reaction chemistry in a way that is well outside the limits of what is possible with existing methods. Coupled with these efforts, the successful development of methods for synthesizing nanoparticles of non-PGE with tailored surface facets—including high-energy stepped surfaces—will also provide a platform for a reduction in the use of PGE and noble metals without necessarily needing to replace them completely. This is an important step in moving toward materials sustainability and will be critical in situations where suitable alternatives to PGE are prohibitively difficult to identify. By epitaxially depositing a monolayer or thin multilayer of a PGE onto shaped non-PGE nanoparticles, the required arrangement of PGE atoms for a particular catalytic transformation can be achieved and stabilized while reducing the amount of the PGE required by orders of magnitude."
Inverse Design of Tungsten-based Low-Activation High Entropy Alloys for Plasma-Facing Materials via Machine-Learning Engineering of Vacancy Exchange Potentials,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023287,"Woller, Kevin",Kevin.Woller@massachusettsinstituteoftechnology,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Inverse Design of Tungsten-based Low-Activation High Entropy Alloys for Plasma-Facing Materials via Machine-Learning Engineering of Vacancy Formation Potentials Principal Investigator: Dr. Kevin Woller1 Co-Investigators: Prof. Michael Short2, Prof. Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli3, Dr. Sara Ferry1 1MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center 2MIT Dept. of Nuclear Science and Engineering 3MIT Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering The Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee report from 2020 underscores the critical need for the development of advanced plasma-facing materials (PFMs) for service in fusion power plants. Ideal PFMs will have low activation, maintain good thermo-mechanical properties at very high temperatures and in the presence of extreme radiation/particle fields, be resistant to sputtering erosion, and have low tritium (T) retention. Tungsten (W) is the leading PFM option. However, W has low fracture toughness, forms surface fuzz layers that ablate and contaminate the plasma, and tends to blister due to the accumulation of D and He in defects under the surface. We need a more robust material for plasma-facing components. High entropy alloys (HEAs), which have multiple principal elements and an essentially infinite composition space for optimization, are a promising class of materials for this purpose. HEAs can be designed for exceptional high-temperature thermomechanical behavior. Recent results have shown that certain HEAs have far better radiation damage resistance than traditional alloys or W-based materials. Despite these benefits, the nearly infinite compositional space creates a daunting challenge for optimizing HEAs that possess and retain desirable properties to function as PFMs exposed to high temperatures and radiation fields. In this project, we will combine high-throughput experimental testing with machine-learning algorithms to demonstrate an inverse-design approach to HEA discovery. The algorithm is centered on our hypothesis that radiation damage resistance in the HEA can be optimized by maximizing the variance in the potential energy landscape (PEL) of the constituent elements. This workflow is designed for rapid discovery of HEAs optimized for stability and radiation damage resistance. It eliminates the need to painstakingly synthesize and test hundreds of individual, targeted compositions. For this project, we will work with the W-Cr-Ti-V-Ta HEA system; create a thick-film meta-sample with order 100 unique compositions by physical vapor deposition (PVD); use transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) to map thermomechanical properties of the meta-sample (both as-fabricated and after plasma exposure); use this data to train a Crystal Graph Convolutional Networks (CCGN)/Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based machine-learning (ML) algorithm; use the algorithm to predict high-performing HEA compositions; fabricate and characterize those compositions; use the data to further train the algorithm; and down-select to a small number of HEAs to be fabricated on more bulk-relevant scales for more-extensive testing in fusion-relevant conditions. If the down-selected HEAs are indeed high-performing, this would validate the PEL-variance hypothesis and demonstrate the value of the inverse-design workflow demonstrated in this project. This project is the first step towards a generalized physics-based, machine-learning-enabled materials discovery platform that will validate and accelerate the development of HEA PFMs for fusion applications."

Inspired by the Urban IFL call to provide knowledge that informs equitable solutions that can strengthen community-scale resilience, we propose a people-centered, transdisciplinary IFL. BSEC begins with community priorities (human health and safety, affordable energy, transportation equity, and others) and city government priorities (clean waterways, decarbonization, functioning infrastructure) and designs observation networks and models that will deliver the climate science capable of supporting those priorities. This means that BSEC takes the form of an iterative collaborative cycle, in which an initial observation and modeling strategy is continuously updated in conversation with community partners. The guiding objective of this cycle is to produce the urban climate science needed to inform community-guided “potential equitable pathways” for climate action. In doing so, we address a number of fundamental urban science questions from across natural science and social science disciplines. BSEC focuses on Baltimore, a metropolitan area that is representative of the climate challenges faced by many mid-sized industrial cities in the United States, and in particular with eastern “rust belt” cities that face interlinked challenges of aging infrastructure, stagnant populations, increased heat and flood risk, and inequitable burdens of air and water pollution. These cities are challenging and critical places for equitable climate solutions. The BSEC Equitable Pathways approach aligns urban science with information needs through coupled cycles of model and observation improvement and participatory assessment of climate risks in the context of multiple, potentially competing priorities. Recognizing that city residents and institutions have diverse and sometimes competing goals, we place a multi-objective analysis tool at the center of our project plan. This analysis tool offers an integrating nexus to inform and challenge urban climate science with the decision needs of the residents and stakeholders who ultimately determine the success of climate action. We will deploy advanced urban environmental measurement networks combined with the best urban models available. The model-data observatory will document urban microclimate, hydrology and air quality, indoor and outdoor, with unparalleled resolution and encompass the processes that govern these critical state variables. The model improvement cycle that uses these data and models to develop the best possible urban climate modeling systems will be informed by and adapt to community needs, creating a truly community-centered urban climate observatory. Equitable climate solutions begin with community knowledge. The role of a solutions-oriented urban IFL is to amplify and enhance that knowledge, and this is only possible when there is mutual trust and respect across all project partners. The BSEC team includes collaborators from neighborhood organizations, city government, non-government community development organizations, federal environmental and research agencies, and academic researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Together, we will build a collaborative urban science framework that brings advanced measurement and observation methods into conversation with community and government deliberation on climate action. In doing so, the BSEC IFL will provide a model for community-oriented interdisciplinary urban science that advances climate solutions in Baltimore and that can be applied in many other metropolitan areas. We will also establish a new generation of urban climate scientists and urban modeling systems capable of supporting predictions and community planning across a wide range of urban areas."
Elucidating the genetic components of the physiological and metabolic processes governed by the TORC regulatory module in Poplar,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023011,"Coleman, Gary",Gary.Coleman@universityofmaryland,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","ABSTRACT Elucidating the genetic components of the physiological and metabolic processes governed by the TORC regulatory module in Poplar Gary D. Coleman, University of Maryland College Park (Principal Investigator) Yiping Qi, University of Maryland College Park (Co-Investigator) Edward Eisenstein, University of Maryland College Park (Co-Investigator) Victor Busov, Michigan Technological University (Co-Investigator) Hairong Wei, Michigan Technological University (Co-Investigator) Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits related to resource use efficiency and abiotic stress is necessary for improving lignocellulose crops for a sustainable biobased economy. Poplar (Populus spp.) is an important and sustainable bioenergy and bioproduct plant feedstock, yet the biological processes that control and govern how resources are used and how stresses such as drought impact these processes is not well understood. Nutrient sensing and signaling is a fundamental mechanism which modulates cellular activities that mediate growth, development, and biomass accrual. The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is a conserved protein that is part of complex that takes information related to nutrients, energy, and stress and integrates this information to control gene expression, metabolism, and physiology. In plants, the activity of the TOR protein signaling complex also responds to diverse forms of nitrogen nutrients and has been linked to molecular on/off switches termed Rop GTPases which also modulate the signaling function of the TOR protein complex. Although these factors (Rop GTPase and TOR signaling) have been shown to be important to how plants sense and respond to nutrients like nitrogen, little is known about how these factors function in relation to nutrient responses in poplar. Interestingly, compared to other plants such as Arabidopsis and rice which have one gene for TOR, poplar has two TOR genes. In addition, in plants with one TOR gene, studying the function of TOR has been hampered since mutating this gene in those species is lethal. However, we have discovered that it is possible to mutate, or gene edit, the two poplar TOR genes to vary their activity or function and viable plants with specific traits and appearance can be produced. This provides a unique opportunity to employ genome editing to determine if the two poplar TOR genes have the same or different functions and how each gene contributes to sensing nitrogen nutrients. The overall objective of this research is to identify the molecular processes involved in sensing and signaling of the TOR protein complex in relation to nutrient responses and the role or involvement of the Rop GTPase on/off switches in the nutrient responses controlled by the TOR protein complex. Through experiments that use CRISPR gene editing, genomics, biochemical, and computational approaches we intend to decipher the functional role and possible differences in the function of the two poplar TOR genes by altering gene dosage and identifying the functional linkage between Rop GTPase signal integration and TOR activity. The specific objectives of the project are to (1) characterize carbon and nitrogen mediated TOR activation and function in poplar cells; (2) alter gene dosage of the two poplar TOR genes to determine if they have similar or different functions in relation to carbon and nitrogen signaling; (3) determine which members of the small GTPase Rop gene family can integrate different nitrogen signals to activate TOR function; and (4) identify if and how the molecular processes controlled by the Rop-GTPase-TOR system in relation to nutrient status may have diverged. The results of this project will allow our team to elucidate function and divergence in this nutrient signaling system allowing for identification of the regulatory and signaling networks and hubs involved in nitrogen responses in poplar. Although this research is focused on nitrogen nutrition, it is likely that the results of this project will also uncover aspects of how TOR and Rop GTPases modulate other processes such as abiotic and biotic stress, and developmental processes regulating biomass yield."

Many trainees fail to learn quickly enough to graduate from Operator training. Despite relatively high salaries, many trainees who graduate are relatively quickly hired away from public utilities by better-paying jobs in the private sector. Public utilities need a better training pipeline for Load Operators. To develop a better training pipeline, InnoSys is applying simulation-based Learning-by-Doing training to Load Operators. This approach efficiently trains people who must understand complex systems in order to resolve faults with unexpected symptoms arising from never-before-experienced situations. Learning by doing exploits the advantages of training within a simulation in a variety of ways. First, training is conducted within the situation in which the knowledge is used trainees not only learn how the system works, but when specific types of knowledge should be applied. Second, training requires trainees to practice thinking how to solve problems within a context that is similar to their job. If they need help to solve the problem, rather than being told the resolution, they are given hints and use them to resolve the situation—trainees construct their knowledge as they resolve problems. Third, training is constructed to minimize cognitive overload as trainees solve problems--for example, first trainees focus on solving the problem; then they focus on lessons learned. In Phase I, we identified an existing, commercially proven simulation of the power grid to enhance with our training enhancements. We tested and refined methods to capture expertise from experienced and improve trusted Operators. The expertise was used to design an assessment system which yielded a score of overall performance and identified performance weaknesses. The expertise was also used to design instructional interactions to improve trainee performance and knowledge. What is planned for the Phase II project: We will apply Learning by Doing by creating scenario- based training for (1) load operators facing power outages after natural disaster and (2) unemployed workers who are considering changing careers to become load operators. Both of these training packages will be developed and deployed with refinement from collaborating utilities, tested for effectiveness, and then made commercially available. Commercialization success of our Experiential Load Operation Trainer will require that decision makers who select training must pay attention to (1) the metrics that show the advantages of Learning by Doing, (2) inspecting the instruction and appreciating its advantages, and/or (3) testimonials from students and experts who have observed how effectively it trains. Our commercialization approach is to license our technology and courses to companies that already sell training to power-grid training companies. The training methods developed and tested can be applied much more broadly within the power industry and more broadly to utilities and manufacturing industry sectors. Currently, the market size for operator training via simulation is slightly over $11B. The CAGR for the next 4 years is projected to be about 12.5%. The market size for simulator training for operators will approach $20B."

Expanding on major progress achieved during the first funding period, our renewal effort aims at understanding, codifying, and generalizing how ionic, solvent and surface effects, along with designed interactions and conformational flexibility, drive emergent phenomena in the self-assembly and reconfiguration of high-information content building blocks. In Thrust 1, we will determine the molecular-scale distribution and response of sidechains, solvent, and ions in the interfacial region of approaching building blocks, and atomic and nanoscale inorganic components targeted for assembly or directed nucleation. We will seek to understand how these distributions and responses give rise to the interaction potentials that orchestrate materials formation at different scales. In Thrust 2, we will fabricate 2D and 3D hierarchical and hybrid materials by understanding how the interplay of interactions between disparate blocks, surfaces, solvent, and electrolytes determined in Thrust 1 define the energy landscapes across which hierarchy develops and inorganic nucleation proceeds. In Thrust 3, we will achieve adaptive control of synthetic outcomes and access non-equilibrium and metastable states of matter by integrating the tools of data science with in situ characterization and simulations, and by using external fields and localized changes in solution chemistry. The cross-cutting synthesis of protein, polymeric and inorganic building blocks that enable all aspects of the research completes our vision for CSSAS."

We seek to accurately describe the autoxidation reaction kinetics with the goal of controlling the product distribution in the autoxidation of complex mixtures of polyolefin wastes. This crucial task will allow for the design of autoxidation methods that efficiently convert plastic waste streams into a narrow distribution of valuable oxygenated products. Autooxidation represents a novel approach for the recycling of plastic waste with a lower carbon footprint than alternatives such as hydrogenolysis and pyrolysis. As such, the implementation of autoxidation methods for the chemical upcycling of plastic waste streams could set a new milestone in closing the loop in a circular economy."

It is commonly agreed that in the next 15-25 years a “Moore’s crisis” will develop, in which the continuous improvement in computational power and the decrease in cost will end. This project is dedicated to establishing the fundamental research from which the next big information revolution will arise, by answering the grand challenge: “Develop a computational machine that works like the brain” (“neuromorphic”). This device should be able to capture in an energy-efficient manner, the essence from complex inputs and be fault tolerant. Powerful interconnected computers and databases provide seemingly endless information and enable actions at a distance. The massive amount of information at our disposal poses new challenges. How to make sense of it? How to recognize patterns? How to make decisions from vast but often conflicting, incomplete, or imprecise data? How to take complex inputs and obtain from them simple qualitative understanding conclusions? Energy-efficient neuromorphic computing offers the potentially disruptive technological capability to process complex inputs and produce elegantly simple, useful outputs. The breakaway from conventional technology – the Turing-von Neumann paradigm – requires the development of new types of bio-inspired (“neuromorphic”) devices with completely new types of functionalities: artificial synapses, neurons, axons, and dendrites that can be used to construct machines with artificial-intelligence capabilities. The much needed, new, bio-inspired functionalities cannot be implemented using the conventional materials, devices and architecture. They are energetically inefficient, strongly affected by defects, and are about to reach the fundamental limits of size and speed. A stringent energy-efficiency requirement stems from the energetic consideration of existing neural systems, such as the human brain. The human brain requires about 10 Watts, and contains 1011 neurons and 1014synapses, which leads to 0.1 picowatt per synapse. It is widely believed that novel “quantum” materials offer pathways to achieve these functionalities with a similarly high energy efficiency. The principal goal of Q-MEEN-C is to develop the basic understanding of quantum materials at hierarchical length scales that enable energy-efficient, fault/defect-tolerant, emergent networks to yield a materials basis for a neuromorphic computational paradigm. Quantum materials possess multiple properties at various length and time scales that can be used as a platform for energy-efficient neuromorphic phenomena and functionalities. To develop an understanding of which properties need to be optimized and to what extent, it is crucial to test these materials under realistic conditions. As a result, Q-MEEN-C is an integrated research effort influenced by and cognizant of the need for enhanced neuromorphic functionalities and the emergence of novel properties at the network scale. We address this challenge with a holistic approach that considers aspects of materials at various length scales, from the microscopic to the macroscopic, in the same way that the brain itself is understood as an emergent phenomenon. Q-MEEN-C will develop the next-generation energy-efficient quantum-materials-based platforms which could be the basis of neuromorphic computing. Potential Impact: The energy-efficient quantum materials, devices, and systems to be investigated will be key ingredients in the development of a neuromorphic machine that works like the brain. These discoveries will form the basis for the next transformative technological revolution in data manipulation, transmission, and storage. The development of quantum materials for next generation computing approaches pursued by Q-MEEN-C are expected to ameliorate the global energy problem posed by the explosive increase in data manipulation in the next 20 years."

One alternative strategy for storing energy is to use an organic liquid, such as formic acid or methanol, which can release hydrogen on demand. The hydrogen can then be used directly as a fuel. In order to implement this strategy, efficient processes are required both to release hydrogen from organic liquids and to synthesize the organic liquid. The primary objective of this research is to develop sustainable and cost effective systems to release hydrogen from formic acid and methanol and to prepare formic acid and methanol from renewable feedstocks. The chosen approach involves using cost effective molecules featuring iron to facilitate the release of hydrogen from organic liquids and the synthesis of formic acid and methanol from carbon dioxide, a waste gas, and hydrogen. The development of the iron-based molecules involves detailed investigations to understand how their effectiveness in performing the desired transformations varies as the structure of the iron-based molecule or the environmental conditions, such as temperature, pressure or additives are changed. This includes both experimental and computational studies. The plan will not only guide the design of improved systems for the release of hydrogen from organic liquids but will be relevant to many other process for the generation of fuels and other commercial chemicals from carbon dioxide."

This work is directly applicable to multiple explicitly stated priorities in The DIII-D National Fusion Program Five-Year Plan 2019-2024 including: the study of Divertor Closure with the continued and significantly expanded utilization of fast surface eroding thermocouples (SETCs) in the Small Angle Slot (SAS) divertor campaigns; provide never before achieved capabilities on DIII-D to advance Model Validation for Boundary Plasma Solutions with the implementation of a Retarding Field Energy Analyzer (RFEA) at the lower divertor for measurements of the ion energy distribution; and lead studies of Advanced Materials Evaluation by providing interpretive modeling tools, diagnostic support (impurity collector probes), and material characterization techniques to “understand high-Z impurity leakage from the SAS divertor” as part of the SAS-VW divertor operations campaign. Closed divertor configurations like SAS are intended to achieve a cold, strongly dissipative plasma near the divertor target with a plasma temperature of less than 5 eV forcing ‘detachment’ of the plasma and a reduced heat flux on the PFCs, all while allowing core temperature and density to remain sufficiently high for reactor relevant plasma scenarios. The original SAS-1 divertor was upgraded to the SAS-VW configuration in FY22 to assess how tightly baffled ‘V-shaping’ influences detachment as well as provide the opportunity to assess the performance of high-Z plasma facing components in closed divertor geometries. The primary research objectives of this project fall into three categories. 1) Utilize the recently upgraded SETC array to study the effectiveness of the tightly baffled SAS-VW configuration to reduce target heat flux and use the SETCs in coordination with the Langmuir probes (LPs) to study how/when detachment is achieved and the resulting effects on heat flux reduction. Newly installed recessed SETCs in SAS-VW will be used to better distinguish between heat flux delivered by incident plasma flux as compared to neutral/radiative heat flux. Experimental measurements in SAS-VW will be compared with SOLPS plasma modeling to improve the understanding of the magnitude of neutral/radiative heating of PFCs in detached plasma regimes in closed divertors. The SETC arrays will be expanded to other regions of DIII-D including the lower divertor and the planned upgrade of the negative triangularity armor on the outboard walls. 2) UTK has worked with collaborators at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and General Atomics (GA) to develop a combined suite of diagnostics, interpretive modeling, and material characterization tools to significantly expand the ability to assess impurity transport in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) plasma. This workflow will be deployed to assess high-Z impurity leakage from the SAS-VW divertor while varying parameters including core plasma density, injected power, strike point position, and toroidal field direction. Edge Localized Mode (ELM) induced sputtering will be assessed in collaboration with Auburn University and GA to determine the efficacy of ELM mitigation techniques on reducing target erosion. UTK will also contribute to the conceptual design of a Wall Interaction Tile Station (WITS) to enable studies of main-wall erosion. 3) A specialized Retarding Field Energy Analyzer (RFEA) diagnostic head will be developed for the DiMES insertable platform for Ti measurements at the lower divertor. The UTK team has performed the design study and assessed the hardware, data acquisition (DAQ), and electronics needs for installation. The UTK team will lead the assessment of divertor ion energy distributions during a variety of plasma scenarios to establish empirical relationships between Ti and Te at the divertor to inform models including the ongoing SOL impurity transport modeling taking place at UTK."
Long-Lived Charge Separation in Panchromatic Copper Photosensitizers,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023394,"Teets, Thomas",Thomas.Teets@universityofhouston,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Long-Lived Charge Separation in Panchromatic Copper Photosensitizers Thomas S. Teets, University of Houston Critical to emerging approaches to convert sunlight into fuel is the development of earth-abundant materials that absorb sunlight and separate charge, known as chromophores or photosensitizers. Ideally, these materials should absorb light over the entire solar spectrum and form long-lived intermediate states that can perform demanding redox chemistry. Whereas some precious-metal based photosensitizers meet these demands, compounds made from less expensive metals typically do not harvest enough sunlight, do not separate charges for long enough, are not sufficiently durable, or are not readily integrated with other potential components necessary for fuel formation. This project introduces a new class of heteroleptic copper(I) charge-transfer chromophores which overcome these limitations. Copper is an abundant and cheap metal with a diverse range of chemical and electronic structures available, making it ideally suited for applications in this area. Moreover, in its +1 oxidation state copper complexes lack the ligand-field (d-d) excited states that are deleterious to the performance of many other first-row transition metal photosensitizers. The investigated complexes are four-coordinate or three-coordinate structures with one electron-rich chelating ligand (L^X) from where the HOMO (“donor” orbital) resides, and one conjugated ligand (L or L^L) with accessible p-antibonding orbitals where the LUMO (“acceptor” orbital) resides. The L^X ligands are primarily from the ß-diketiminate and related families, L^L is most often a 1,10-phenanthroline derivative ubiquitous in other classes of copper charge-transfer chromophores, and L is from the carbene or isocyanide ligand classes. These architectures result in spatially separated frontier orbitals, allowing independent control over the frontier orbital energies and redox potentials, and build in low-energy, charge-transfer excited states capable of solar absorption over the entire spectrum. The first major goal of the project focuses on molecular design elements geared towards optimizing solar light harvesting and experiments to characterize the dynamics of the charge-separated state. Synthetic chemistry exploration is complemented with rigorous photophysical characterization and DFT analysis to establish robust structure-property relationships in this new class of light absorbers. The second thrust of the project develops strategies intentionally designed to increase the charge-separation distance and the lifetime of the charge-transfer excited state. These approaches involve addition of sterically encumbering substituents to either the donor or acceptor ligand and/or p-conjugated triplet reservoirs to the acceptor ligand, as well as the exploration polymer-supported complexes where the charge-transfer chromophore is embedded into a conjugated polymer capable of long-range charge transport. Finally, the third major direction of the project focuses on the integration of multiple components, including molecular and polymeric frameworks where either two or more different charge-transfer chromophores or a chromophore and catalyst are linked in the same construct. These studies investigate the possibility of using multiple heteroleptic copper(I) chromophores to enhance solar harvesting and create excited states with even greater charge delocalization, while also producing functional arrays where the copper light-absorber is combined with a catalyst capable of small-molecule redox transformations relevant to solar fuels. This research will introduce new light-harvesting molecules appealing for solar fuels applications, addressing several of the challenges set forth in the 2019 Department of Energy Basic Energy Sciences Liquid Solar Fuels Roundtable."

With the wide use of Li-ion batteries for energy storage, disposal or recycling of used batteries is becoming an important environmental concern and a critical research challenge. The electrode coating of common Li-ion batteries black material is composed of valuable Li, Ni, Mn and Co critical metal containing compounds mixed with graphite carbon. In this project we are proposing to develop an inexpensive sugar and oxygen or air based hydrothermal extraction method for the recovery of Li, Ni, Mn and Co metals. Two approaches will be studied for the recovery of valuable metals; which includes the isolation of metals as pure compounds and re-synthesis of active electrode material for the fabrication of new batteries. The proposed research is directly connected to the advancement of clean energy technologies since the recycling of critical metals and re-synthesis of active electrode compounds can reduce the cost of Li-ion batteries, electric vehicles as well as promote the storage of clean electrical energy generated through solar, wind and tidal power in transition to renewable electrical energy."
Harnessing regulatory variation to elucidate drought resilience mechanisms in sorghum,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023305,"Eveland, Andrea",Andrea.Eveland@donalddanforthplantsciencecenter,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Harnessing regulatory variation to elucidate drought resilience mechanisms in sorghum Andrea L. Eveland, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (Principal Investigator) Todd C. Mockler, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (co-Investigator) Duke Pauli, University of Arizona (co-Investigator) Brian Dilkes, Purdue University (co-Investigator) Project Objectives: This project investigates the innate drought resilience of Sorghum bicolor, a bioenergy feedstock and cereal crop, by leveraging DOE-funded resources to link molecular function to dynamic, whole-plant phenotypes. The overall project objective is to define and functionally characterize genes related to drought stress tolerance in sorghum, and variations on gene regulation that drive phenotypic plasticity. Outcomes will accelerate the development of improved, climate-resilient varieties for production on marginal soils with limited inputs. Specific objectives include: 1) Leveraging an integrative multi-omics framework for drought response in sorghum and its genetic diversity to predict functions of genes and their regulatory components; 2) Dissecting the morpho-physiological processes by which sorghum responds to drought at the whole-plant level and linking these back to genetic loci; and 3) Experimentally validating predictions of gene function using molecular and genetic assays and targeted gene editing. Project Description, Methods, and Outcomes: Development of the next generation of bioenergy feedstocks necessary for a new bioeconomy will require strategies that utilize resource-limited agricultural lands, including introduction of novel traits into crops that increase abiotic stress tolerance. Sorghum is an attractive system for the development of bioenergy feedstocks because of its innate resilience to drought and heat stresses, versatile end-uses, and a rapidly developing suite of genetic, genomic and phenomic tools. Sorghum is well-poised as a model for gene discovery and, given its adaptability, stress tolerance, and genotypic diversity, is an excellent crop for studying genotype-to-phenotype relationships and dissecting genotype-by-environment interactions. Drought response is complex and identifying the genes underlying sorghum’s characteristic drought tolerance and how they are regulated in the broader context of the whole plant and its environment requires advanced approaches in genetics, genomics, and field phenotyping. The proposed work leverages a field-based phenotyping infrastructure at Maricopa, AZ, which provides an exceptional capability for managed stress trials in a hot and arid environment through controlled irrigation. An automated field scanner system collects high-resolution phenotyping data using a variety of sensors throughout the growth season, from seedling establishment to harvest. State-of-the-art phenotyping analytics pipelines have been developed as part of DOE-funded initiatives and are extended here to define stress-related phenotypes of sorghum at multiple scales. Diverse sorghum lines (i.e., from a specialized diversity panel and mutagenized populations) will be phenotyped under the field scanner to compare well-watered and water-limited growth. Each line has been completely sequenced so that sequence variants can be linked with phenotypes. Being able to assess genotype to phenotype in response to drought over the life cycle of the plant will enable the development of predictive growth models and the discovery of genes and their functions. Advanced genomics methods and molecular tools will be used to define functional elements of the genome, variation in these elements across sorghum diversity, and how to manipulate them for precise changes in plant phenotype. This project will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team of scientists who draw upon a broad range of relevant expertise in genomics, phenotyping analytics, quantitative genetics, plant physiology and plant development to link genotype to multi-dimensional phenotypes for accelerated prediction and elucidation of gene function. Identifying the genes and regulatory networks that underlie phenotypic variation in drought response will ultimately reveal the genetic basis for the remarkable phenotypic plasticity in sorghum. This includes control points for drought resilience, which can be manipulated through precision breeding or genome engineering. The project will also generate invaluable genetic and genomic resources for the community, including expanded sorghum mutant resources, gene network models, sequences, and whole-plant phenotypes for diverse sorghum germplasm."

Inspired by the Urban IFL call to provide knowledge that informs equitable solutions that can strengthen community-scale resilience, we propose a people-centered, transdisciplinary IFL. BSEC begins with community priorities (human health and safety, affordable energy, transportation equity, and others) and city government priorities (clean waterways, decarbonization, functioning infrastructure) and designs observation networks and models that will deliver the climate science capable of supporting those priorities. This means that BSEC takes the form of an iterative collaborative cycle, in which an initial observation and modeling strategy is continuously updated in conversation with community partners. The guiding objective of this cycle is to produce the urban climate science needed to inform community-guided “potential equitable pathways” for climate action. In doing so, we address a number of fundamental urban science questions from across natural science and social science disciplines. BSEC focuses on Baltimore, a metropolitan area that is representative of the climate challenges faced by many mid-sized industrial cities in the United States, and in particular with eastern “rust belt” cities that face interlinked challenges of aging infrastructure, stagnant populations, increased heat and flood risk, and inequitable burdens of air and water pollution. These cities are challenging and critical places for equitable climate solutions. The BSEC Equitable Pathways approach aligns urban science with information needs through coupled cycles of model and observation improvement and participatory assessment of climate risks in the context of multiple, potentially competing priorities. Recognizing that city residents and institutions have diverse and sometimes competing goals, we place a multi-objective analysis tool at the center of our project plan. This analysis tool offers an integrating nexus to inform and challenge urban climate science with the decision needs of the residents and stakeholders who ultimately determine the success of climate action. We will deploy advanced urban environmental measurement networks combined with the best urban models available. The model-data observatory will document urban microclimate, hydrology and air quality, indoor and outdoor, with unparalleled resolution and encompass the processes that govern these critical state variables. The model improvement cycle that uses these data and models to develop the best possible urban climate modeling systems will be informed by and adapt to community needs, creating a truly community-centered urban climate observatory. Equitable climate solutions begin with community knowledge. The role of a solutions-oriented urban IFL is to amplify and enhance that knowledge, and this is only possible when there is mutual trust and respect across all project partners. The BSEC team includes collaborators from neighborhood organizations, city government, non-government community development organizations, federal environmental and research agencies, and academic researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Together, we will build a collaborative urban science framework that brings advanced measurement and observation methods into conversation with community and government deliberation on climate action. In doing so, the BSEC IFL will provide a model for community-oriented interdisciplinary urban science that advances climate solutions in Baltimore and that can be applied in many other metropolitan areas. We will also establish a new generation of urban climate scientists and urban modeling systems capable of supporting predictions and community planning across a wide range of urban areas."
GPU-Accelerated Understanding and Design of Frank-Kasper Phases and Quasicrystals in Model Block Copolymers,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023203,"Wang, Qiang (David)",Qiang (David).Wang@coloradostateuniversity,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Initially found in metallic alloys, the Frank-Kasper (FK) phases refer to a class of complex structures where coordination polyhedra have only triangular faces. Some FK structures are periodic approximants of quasicrystals (QCs), which are aperiodic structures having sharp Bragg diffraction peaks but of a symmetry order (e.g., five-fold) other than the allowed two-, three-, four-, and six-fold rotational symmetries of ordinary crystals. QCs were again initially discovered in metallic alloys, and altered the notion of crystals. The recent discovery of FK phases and QCs in various soft materials, particularly in block copolymers (BCPs), however, indicates the existence of certain universal principles governing the complex structure formation in a wide range of condensed matter at different length scales. BCPs consist of chemically distinct polymer chains (i.e., blocks) covalently bonded together, and can spontaneously self-assemble into well-defined structures with their characteristic length ranging from a few to tens or even hundreds of nanometers. This makes the application of BCP QCs as, for example, complete photonic bandgaps very promising. From fundamental viewpoint, the delicate balance of the energetic repulsion between various blocks and their entropic stretching under the space-filling requirement in BCP self-assembly gives somewhat different formation mechanisms of FK phases and QCs from the packing of hard spheres in metallic alloys, thus making these complex structures more controllable via, for example, BCP synthesis and blending. The overall goal of this three-year, fundamental research project is to enable rational design of FK phases and QCs formed by linear diblock copolymer (DBC) A-B melts via understanding their formation mechanisms and the effects of system fluctuations/correlations on them. This will be achieved by combining GPU-accelerated self-consistent field (SCF) calculations and well-tempered metadynamics (WTM) simulations based on the same dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) model. The hypotheses are: (1) FK phases other than the commonly studied A15 and s could be stable in A-B melts, since only 11 FK phases have ever been studied and only A15 and s are found to be stable in A-B melts while 27 FK phases have been discovered to date. (2) The fluctuation/correlation effects inherently neglected by all SCF calculations are critically important for the low-molecular-weight DBC melts forming FK phases in experiments and can be unambiguously quantified by directly comparing the SCF and WTM results based on the same DPD model, thus without any parameter-fitting. This proposed work is of paramount interest to materials research in not only polymers but also metals and metallic nanostructures, providing fundamental insights into the formation mechanisms of FK phases and QCs and essential guidance to their experimental design for targeted applications. In particular, the fascinating QCs and FK phases other than A15 and s formed by BCPs have been rarely studied, and the significant fluctuation/correlation effects on their formation and stability in low-molecular-weight BCPs are currently not understood at all. The unique approach of combining GPU-accelerated SCF calculations and WTM simulations based on the same DPD model (which can be quantitatively mapped to experimental systems) is judiciously designed to tackle these problems with high efficiency, and the anticipated results will provide detailed information on the structures and thermodynamics of FK phases and QCs, as well as their experimental design strategies. Finally, the developed code, along with all the data generated in this research, will be made freely available and reusable to the scientific community, industry, and general public, not only to validate the research results here, but also to advance the research field. The methodology can further be readily extended to other polymeric systems (e.g., BCPs of more complex architectures or in confined geometries, polymer solutions, brushes, polyelectrolytes) having many important technological applications."

VBS processes stress test the SM by probing several fundamental properties of the Electroweak sector and are closely related to the Higgs mechanism. Modifications of the VBS cross sections are predicted in models of physics beyond the Standard Model through modifications of the Higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons or through the presence of new resonances. The observation of the longitudinally polarized VBS is one of the main goals of High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The performance of the new ATLAS all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) detector is crucial to achieve this goal. This research program also includes strong scientific contributions to the ATLAS ITk Strip project and to the ATLAS Upgrade Tracking group. The two-pronged approach involves work on the assembly, testing, and commissioning of components of the ITk Barrel Strip detector as well as studies of charged particle tracking at the HL-LHC to extract the maximum available information from the new ITk detectors."

Notably, this initiative has led to development of an exciting new scenario in next-generation accelerator-based instruments, the ultra-compact X-ray FEL (UC-XFEL). This proposed device serves as both a foundational project for a future LC, and a revolutionary light source as well – one that lowers the cost and size of the XFEL by over an order of magnitude. The core technique underpinning the applications is the use of cryogenic RF cavities at an optimum frequency, 5712 MHz, which permits up to 500 MV/m field operation while enabling acceleration of relatively large charges, to a nC. This new method of very high field operation has been jointly developed by SLAC and the UCLA Particle Beam Physics Laboratory program (PBPL) over the last half decade. From the viewpoint of HEP applications, this initiative serves as a stepping-stone technology for a linear collider. The cryogenic C-band linear collider (C3, Cold Copper Collider) has been put forward by project SLAC through co-PI, Prof. Sami Tantawi. This proposal explicitly recognizes the formal joining the C3/UC-XFEL projects into on collaboration, with a board (PI Rosenzweig, spokesman). The shared goals of developing ~125 MeV/m gradient structures and high brightness electron beam sources based on ultra-high cathode fields have permitted a high degree of synergy. This unified approach has allowed the harnessing of resources needed for advanced cryogenic C-band research. Multi-MW C-band RF sources are not common in the US, and as such, the collaboration has built up the capabilities for C-band R&D from the ground up. The proposal originally funded under this grant foresaw the use of a loaned 50 MW klystron that did not materialize. For the core UCLA work, operation after many decades of unuse of a 5 MW klystron that was re-established, developing all new infrastructure in a new laboratory, the UCLA MOTHRA RF lab, constructed purposely for this project, and a new accelerator bunker complex termed SAMURAI. Both MOTHRA and SAMURAI have been outfitted with ultra-fast lasers for photocathode experiments and laser-electron interaction experiments. The UCLA resources have been complemented by a high-power test facility at LANL which is to be used for exploring the performance envelope of high field test structures, to establish the ~500 MV/m peak field in C-band. The LANL test facility does not have adequate shielding for a full scale 1-m linac test, which is a critical part of the mission of the C3/UC-XFEL collaboration. At UCLA, emerging capabilities include cryo-cooler/cryostat development, the construction of a single cryogenic photo-emisssion RF test stand with load lock. This infrastructure is partially funded by the NSF CBB STC. Additional C-band resources are available to the collaboration from the DARPA GRIT ICS project, in which RadiaBeam, UCLA, SLAC, and Univ. Rome participate. In the is coming period, the collaboration will take advantage of the momentum build during the its first two years. Foreseen activities include: commissioning and measurements of cryogenic photoemission test stand, with measurement of lowered Cu and Cs2Te MTEs; measurement of intrabeam scattering effects in cryogenic photoemission test stand; characterization of anomalous skin effect in C-band including novel increase below 10K; measurement of 1-m test linac structure at RadiaBeam at room temperature; photoinjector commissioning and characterization of beam dynamics in both asymmetric emittance and ultra-high brightness modes; first measurements of ultra-high field operation of test structures with relevant reentrant nose-cone geometry; exploration of brazeless joining approach to fabrication; characterization and control of dark current in test structures; optimized design and fabrication of cryogenic RF gun structure; realization of cryogenic solenoid based on new fabrication winding technique; development of SLED system UCLA, including increase the available RF power to over 20 MW; full emittance characterization of magnetized and unmagnetized beams in cryogenic photoinjector, including acceleration with a high gradient (>100 MeV/m) linac."

While most thermodynamic cycles rely on a classical fluid, the Photonics at Thermodynamic Limits Energy Frontier Research Center (PTL-EFRC) envisions thermodynamic cycles based on light. Light can be completely converted to heat at the same temperature; in turn, that heat can be completely converted to light at the same effective temperature. Such photon-based Carnot cycles would create remarkable opportunities for energy conversion, including all-optical energy-storage, optical cooling and refrigeration, and beyond von-Neumann information architectures. Though such photon-driven thermodynamic processes have long been theorized, optical systems typically exhibit efficiencies far too low to make photon-driven thermodynamic processes possible. Since 2018, the PTL EFRC has made major and well-recognized advances in creating optical materials with ever-increasing photonic efficiency, establishing a foundation for photonic thermodynamic cycles. We have developed nanoparticles and 2D materials with record quantum yields and near-unity reflection and absorption, and advanced ab-initio theory and new atomic-scale and ultrafast optical characterization tools to unravel the electron dynamics that lead to radiative losses. With these insights, the PTL pioneered photonic thermodynamic systems including world-record-efficiency thermophotovoltaic cells, luminescent solar concentrators, photonic voltage transformers for power electronics, light-driven propulsion schemes, and radiative energy harvesting and cooling. In this project, we will explore nonlinear photonic materials processes, providing a foundation for optically-powered neuromorphic, memristive, refrigerative, and energy storage architectures, and reversible computing with no entropy generation. Our bold mission demands a multi-faceted EFRC-level effort where theory provides insights to guide materials synthesis and energy conversion systems that are in turn validated by state-of-the-art characterization at the nanometer to atomic scale with ultrafast time resolution. To pioneer photonic thermodynamic cycles, we have assembled an integrated, collaborative team of 10 faculty spanning 5 departments at Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech, and UCLA. The PTL-EFRC will be directed by Prof. J. A. Dionne and centered at its lead institution, Stanford University. Members of our EFRC contribute leading expertise in photonics, materials synthesis, theory and measurement science. The PTL-EFRC is organized into three research groups (RGs) that each span multiple institutional partners. RG1, Atomically Precise Photonic Materials, will identify the limits of photonic processes using novel quantum-electrodynamic and first-principles calculations and synthesize new materials that approach thermodynamic and quantum limits. RG2, Optical Characterization with Atomic and Ultrafast Resolution, will develop methods to correlate structure-to-function with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. And RG3, Photonic Thermodynamic Systems, will design photonic energy conversion systems that exploit photonic operations at thermodynamic limits. These RGs serve our scientific objectives, which are strongly resonant with DOE priority research needs, grand challenges, and transformative opportunities. The expected PTL-EFRC outcomes are: i) new forms of matter, suggested by theoretical insights and synthesized with atomic precision, that achieve unprecedented levels of optical efficiency; ii) new foundational understanding of the thermodynamic and quantum limits to excited state generation and lifetime in atomically-architected optical materials, informed by theory and ultrafast/nanoscale characterization methods; iii) development of new theoretical methods to describe optically excited states and processes; iv) development of new methods to determine optical efficiency and observe excited state relaxation processes with unprecedented detail; and v) a set of photonic thermodynamic cycles that use light as the working fluid and perform work with an efficiency approaching the Carnot efficiency."

Measurement of Helicons and Parametric Decay Waves in DIII-D with Phase Contrast Imaging,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0016154,"Porkolab, Miklos",Miklos.Porkolab@massachusettsinstituteoftechnology,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Phase Contrast Imaging for Multiscale Measurements of Turbulence and Helicon Waves in DIII–D Miklos Porkolab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (PI) The most promising fusion reactor concept is based on the tokamak magnetic confinement configuration that produces a steady state, high performance plasma, confined by pressure driven “bootstrap” currents in the plasma core, but which also requires externally driven localized currents mid-radius to aid in the formation of a stable plasma. A new radiofrequency (RF) system operating at 476 MHz has been installed in the DIII-D tokamak to test a novel current drive method, based on launching a traveling helicon (or whistler) wave, with the potential to drive localized currents efficiently as needed in a high temperature fusion grade plasma such DIII-D, or in a next step Fusion Power Plant (FPP) or in a commercial tokamak reactor. We have developed a novel method to measure the location, amplitude, and structure of the helicon wave in the core of the DIII-D plasma, based on laser interferometry and the phase contrast imaging (PCI) technique. Phase Contrast Imaging has long provided measurement of low-frequency density fluctuations on DIII-D and other tokamaks, both broadband turbulence as well as magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. While these phenomena occur at relatively low frequencies (of the order of 1 MHz or less) where cryogenically cooled detectors are readily available to measure the scattered laser beam, these detectors are not suitable to detect the very high frequency helicon waves. To overcome this deficiency, we have developed a novel “heterodyne” method by modulating a portion of the laser beam amplitude at a frequency that is comparable, but slightly separated from the helicon wave frequency. After the beams pass through the plasma and recombine on the detector surface, they are detectable at the beat frequency in the 1 MHz range. This method then enables us to measure the amplitude of the high frequency helicon wave deep in the plasma. The new PCI measurements of the helicon wave will serve two purposes: first, they will provide a direct measurement of the wave amplitude in the plasma, thereby allowing the assessment of the efficiency of coupling the RF power by a suitable antenna to the propagating helicon wave; and second, the measurements will be used to validate the results of sophisticated computer models which predict the structure and propagation of the helicon wave in the plasma and assess the efficiency with which such RF systems can drive currents. State-of-the-art computer modeling will be used to calculate the expected helicon wave amplitude and structure in three dimensions, and the results will be compared to the PCI measurements using a synthetic diagnostic approach. This modeling will also be used to design experiments which provide the optimal testing conditions for verifying the physics of current drive by helicon waves. These computer models are vital to optimizing the design of next step plasma fusion devices. The laser modulated PCI developed in this project is the most versatile for measuring high frequency RF waves in the plasma and will open up additional areas of study. For example, the efficiency of the helicon system at driving current in the core of the plasma may be limited by the loss of power to scattering by turbulence or parametric decay instabilities, both occurring near the plasma edge region, thus depleting the energy available to couple the RF power to the helicon waves that drive the currents in the plasma core. The threshold for these instabilities has been computed theoretically and found to be sensitive to the edge plasma parameters. The upgraded PCI would allow testing of theoretical models which predict the dependence of such deleterious phenomena on the plasma edge parameters. This kind of code validation is essential if we wish to consider the helicon RF current drive method to next step fusion devices with reactor relevant conditions. Another component of this project is to develop the next generation of PCI diagnostic with an order of magnitude better spatial sensitivity and vastly increased frequency range, for example measuring ion cyclotron waves with frequencies of the order of 40-80MHz that is being deployed in other tokamaks, including ITER and possibly in future fusion reactors to heat ions. We also note that the new diagnostic capabilities will open up new areas of study of higher frequency turbulence, such as measuring short wavelength instabilities driven by electron temperature gradients that occur in the 2-10 MHz range."

The Super-K experiment is unique in that it works both at the cosmic frontier (studying atmospheric, solar, supernova and, potentially, other astrophysical neutrinos), and at the intensity frontier (as the far detector in the T2K long baseline beam), to reveal the nature of the universe and the fundamental properties of particles. In the search for proton decay, Super-K investigates the basic constituents of particle physics in a way that may reveal new fundamental symmetries of nature. Task B – PI: Jianming Bian Task B focuses on US-based long-baseline neutrino experiments DUNE and NOvA. We are responsible for DUNE’s purity monitoring system and QA/QC of DUNE ColdADC and COLDATA ASICs. UCI pioneered the deep-learning-based neutrino kinematics reconstruction at DUNE and NOvA. UCI plays a leading role in the 3-flavor oscillation and the neutrino-electron elastic scattering analyses at NOvA. We will: commission ProtoDUNE2 purity monitors and cold electronics, design and fabricate the DUNE FD purity monitoring system and corresponding cryogenic, carry out the massive QA/QC task for DUNE FD cold electronics, further develop deep learning kinematics reconstruction at NOvA and DUNE, improving the interpretability of NN, perform the NOvA oscillation analysis with new data and ML-based algorithms, and continue our nu-e elastic scattering measurement at NOvA ND and use the result to constrain the NuMI beam. Task C – PI: Pedro Ochoa-Ricoux Task C is dedicated to making some of the most precise measurements of neutrino oscillation in the world. Our team plays a leading role in the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment and is actively working on some of the most important results to be produced with its final data set, namely the measurement of the ?13 and ?m232 parameters and the search for sterile neutrinos. In parallel, we are actively involved in the development of the liquid argon detector of DUNE’s near detector complex, which will be essential to this experiment’s oscillation physics program. Our team is responsible for the firmware of this detector’s charge readout system and co-leads the effort to develop simulation, reconstruction, and analysis tools for it. Task D – PI: William Molzon The research of Task D focuses on searches for new phenomena that would indicate a fundamentally new type of interaction between the basic constituents of matter. We now know that the three types of neutrinos have non-zero and different masses, which cause them to oscillate from one type to another as they travel through space, a research result of Task A. The Standard Model of particle physics must be expanded to describe these masses and oscillations. Many extensions to the Standard Model, largely motivated by other theoretical considerations, allow related processes such as a muon decaying to an electron and a photon. This would be too rare to see in the most minimal change necessary to explain neutrino oscillations. If seen, this process would be a smoking gun signal of physics beyond the Standard Model. The Task D group is proposing to continue their sensitive experiment to detect the processes µ?e? in the MEG2 experiment. They are now analyzing first data from the experiment and are expecting to discover this reaction if it occurs as infrequently as once in 100 trillion muon decays. Task E – PI’s: Andrew Lankford, Daniel Whiteson, Anyes Taffard The UCI energy frontier research program (Lankford, Taffard, Whiteson) is based upon the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. This facility presents a unique opportunity to search for new phenomena, either through precision experiments probing the standard model of particle physics or through direct searches for new phenomena at the energy frontier. The group plays leading roles in beyond-the-standard-model searches for supersymmetry (SUSY), dark matter, resonances, and lepton flavor violation. In SUSY, the group uses multi-lepton final states to probe many areas, including stops and higgsinos. In dark matter, the group has explored many final states, with emphasis on pioneering new approaches, opening new terrain, and exploring unexamined datasets, including phenomenological studies with theorists. Task F – PI: David Kirkby David Kirkby proposes to continue his research program at the cosmic frontier, focused on the science of dark energy. The group studies the large-scale distribution of dark matter in the Universe, which constrains the fundamental parameters governing the evolution of both dark matter and dark energy since the Big Bang. We use observations from two large astronomical surveys: the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Vera Rubin Observatory. We contribute to the design and operations of these projects and also analyze and interpret their data. Task G – PI: Simona Murgia UCI Task G (S. Murgia) focuses on weak lensing and dark energy science at the Rubin Observatory / LSST. Murgia proposes to continue to work on modeling aspects of the LSST CCD response that impact the measurement of weak gravitational lensing by contributing to physics simulations of these effects and their implementation in LSST astronomical image simulation packages, to the development and validation of methods and pipelines to correct for these effects, and by assessing the impact on dark energy science."

It is necessary that these catalysts minimize the formation of unwanted or harmful side products. Biological catalysts (enzymes) control the molecular environment around the reaction site to catalyze chemical reactions with an unsurpassed degree of specificity. Preparing a similarly customized near-surface environment for synthetic catalysts is an important but challenging objective. One possible approach is to use organic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to organize particular functional groups around the surface active site, thereby promoting specific surface-reactant interactions. The guiding vision for the proposed work is that application of SAMs to atomically dispersed catalyst systems can both help enforce site isolation and enable exquisite control over reactant-active site interactions. Such “single atom catalysts” (SACs) have potential to enable engineering of atomically precise geometries that can provide unique reactivity compared to their metal nanoparticle. This project will focus on the synthesis and characterization of organic-modified SACs, probing the surface chemistry of energy-relevant probe molecules such as CO2 and hydrogen on these systems, and measuring the performance of such catalysts for important reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation. The overall program of work aims to understand how the manipulation of the environment around atomically dispersed sites can lead to enhanced control over elementary steps in catalysis."
Mathematical and numerical methods for magnetic fusion,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-FG02-86ER53223,"Caflisch, Russel",Russel.Caflisch@newyorkuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Mathematical and numerical methods for magnetic fusion Professor A. Cerfon (Principal Investigator) Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University The two leading concepts for making magnetic confinement fusion a commercially viable source of electricity are the tokamak and the stellarator. The major difference between the tokamak and the stellarator is geometric in nature: the tokamak has perfect rotational symmetry about the central axis at the center of the device, while the stellarator does not have rotational symmetry. This geometric difference has major implications for the confinement of the hot particles which are to undergo nuclear fusion reactions, and which we call a plasma. Specifically, in a tokamak, generating the magnetic fields needed to confine the hot plasma requires the combination of external magnetic coils and an electric current which one has to drive through the plasma. In contrast, in stellarators, magnetic fields which appropriately confine the hot plasma can be generated by solely relying on external magnetic coils. The two different approaches have distinct advantages and drawbacks. Since in a tokamak the magnetic field is partially generated by the current in the plasma, the external magnetic coil set can be relatively simple. Furthermore, it can be shown that particle confinement is guaranteed as soon as one properly drives the electric current in the plasma. In contrast, the external magnetic coil set for stellarators usually has high geometrical complexity and is more expensive to build. Furthermore, it has to be designed and engineered with care, because particle confinement is not mathematically guaranteed in stellarators, and is very sensitive to the magnetic field configuration. Still, stellarators may be more desirable than tokamaks as future commercial fusion power plants, for the following reasons. First, the methods for driving a steady electric current through a plasma are not efficient, which limits the efficiency of tokamaks as compared to stellarators. Second, hot plasmas are subject to instabilities, which have to be avoided in a commercial plant. The large electric current in tokamaks is a major source of instability, and explains in part the experimental observations that stellarators are more robust to instabilities than tokamaks. In our group, we will develop numerical tools and mathematical models to help the fusion community address the drawbacks of the tokamaks and of the stellarators described above. Regarding tokamaks, it has been found that under certain conditions, the plasma can self-generate a substantial electric current, appropriately called the &ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo; current. A natural goal is to investigate scenarios which allow a large fraction of bootstrap current, thereby increasing the efficiency of tokamaks. Such scenarios often involve large and localized pressure gradients, which could give rise to instabilities. We will develop a high order numerical solver with adaptive refinement capabilities to compute the magnetic configuration in such scenarios with high accuracy, and have high numerical resolution in the regions with large pressure gradients without requiring a large number of mesh points overall and thus a large computational cost. Our solver will be designed to provide the necessary inputs to solvers which calculate the stability of the magnetic configuration under consideration, its confinement properties, and the amount of bootstrap current which is generated. Regarding stellarators, we will continue to develop our analytic framework for determining the magnetic configurations leading to good particle confinement. Our approach relies on well-chosen and experimentally well-satisfied approximations which considerably reduce the mathematical complexity of the problem. Whereas configurations with good confinement are usually found as the result of complicated optimization studies, our approximations allow us to generate magnetic fields with good confinement by solving relatively simple ordinary differential equations, which can be done quickly with standard computers. We can therefore explore a large set of potentially satisfying stellarator configurations, and discover the most interesting clusters of configurations, on which the fusion community may then focus its challenging and time-consuming optimization studies."
MECHANISTIC STUDIES OF A PRIMITIVE HOMOLOG OF NITROGENASE INVOLVED IN COENZYME F430 BIOSYNTHESIS,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023451,"Mansoorabadi, Steven",Steven.Mansoorabadi@auburnuniversity,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the key enzyme in the biological formation and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and the major component of natural gas. Given the abundance of natural gas reserves in remote areas, there is great current interest in a scalable bio-based process for the conversion of methane to liquid fuel or other high-value commodity chemicals. MCR holds much promise for use in such a methane bioconversion strategy. However, MCR cannot currently be produced in an active form in a heterologous host, due in large part to the lack of genetic and biochemical information about the production of holo MCR. In an effort to overcome this deficiency, our laboratory elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of the unique nickel-containing coenzyme of MCR, F430. The key step in coenzyme F430 biosynthesis (Cfb) was found to involve an unprecedented reductive cyclization reaction that converts Ni-sirohydrochlorin a,c-diamide to 15,173-seco-F430-173-acid. This remarkable transformation, which involves a 6-electron reduction of the isobacteriochlorin ring system, cyclization of the c-acetamide side chain to form a ?-lactam ring, and the formation of 7 stereocenters, is catalyzed by a primitive homolog of nitrogenase (CfbCD). Nitrogenase is a two-component metalloenzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia (nitrogen fixation). Homologs of nitrogenase are also involved in the biosynthesis of the photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll. Phylogenetic analysis of the CfbCD complex suggests that it is representative of a more ancient lineage of the nitrogenase superfamily, and a thorough investigation of its structure and function is likely to shed light on the mechanisms and evolution of these important metalloenzymes that catalyze multi-electron redox reactions. Moreover, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the CfbCD complex may aid in the development of specific inhibitors to help reduce natural greenhouse gas emissions and can be exploited for the heterologous production of MCR for methane bioconversion. Towards these goals, the following Specific Aims will be pursued to determine the: 1) Identity of the CfbCD reaction product. The exact reaction catalyzed by CfbCD, including the number of electrons transferred and whether it involves enzymatic cyclization, is unclear. Several approaches, including spectroelectrochemistry and magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be applied to elucidate the structure of the reaction product and establish whether CfbCD is a reductase or reductive cyclase. 2) Structure, conformational dynamics, and oligomerization state changes of CfbCD. Significant insight into the mechanism and allosteric regulation of CfbCD can be obtained by assessing changes in the structure and dynamics of the complex during the catalytic cycle. To accomplish this, a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and high-resolution structural methods will be employed. 3) Source, order, and stereochemistry of proton additions during CfbCD catalysis. Details regarding the order and stereochemistry of proton additions during the CfbCD reaction will be uncovered using a combined spectroscopic and computational approach."
Mechanistic and Kinetic Analysis of Polymer Deconstruction and Modification by Irradiation for Polymer Upcycling,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023413,"Jenkins, Courtney",Courtney.Jenkins@idahostateuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Mechanistic and Kinetic Analysis of Polymer Deconstruction and Modification by Irradiation for Polymer Upcycling Dr. Courtney Jenkins, Idaho State University (Principle Investigator) Dr. Joshua Pak, Idaho State University (Co-Investigator) Despite the many benefits of plastics, the accumulation of plastic waste plagues our modern world. It is estimated that nearly 6,300 million tons of waste has been generated thus far. The pursuit for new methods for plastic upcycling has increased dramatically in recent years. Unlike recycling, which often converts plastics into lower quality materials, upcycling converts them high value molecules. However, many of these studies focus on one specific system limiting the broad utility of these methods given the diverse nature of plastic waste. Here, we propose using gamma irradiation to deconstruct a subset of these plastics, specifically, condensation polymers. Despite the many insights that can be gained from prior work, data examining degradation mechanisms are lacking. The innovative aspect of the proposed work is the comprehensive examination of how small changes to the polymer structure influences the mechanisms of the deconstruction of common condensation polymers. These types of plastics all contain a common chemical feature, which can be exploited to help break the long polymer chains into smaller molecules with added value. The proposed work will take a multipronged approach to better understand the breakdown of condensation polymers by gamma irradiation. First, we will use small, model compounds to lay the groundwork for understanding how changes in the polymer backbone impact deconstruction. An array of additives will be tested to see if we can aid in small molecule modification helping form value added products rather than just degrading these materials. Additional analyses will examine alterations polymer chains of different lengths providing data on how the deconstruction patterns scale from small molecules to the impacts on the material as a whole. Finally, we plan to use the experimental data to help predict how other types of common plastics may be broken down by gamma irradiation. A predictive model will be used to drive the selection of small changes to the chemical structure to impact decomposition. Work proposed here will provide mastery of the mechanisms of polymer deconstruction based upon the chemical composition of the plastic and presence of additives. Results from this work are expected to have a positive impact by providing a better understanding of the disassembly of current materials as well as enabling the intelligent design of future plastics that can be efficiently deconstructed under specific conditions."
Redox Cycles of Novel High-Entropy Perovskite Oxides for Clean Fuel Production through Solar Thermochemical Water and Carbon Dioxide Splitting,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023407,"Tong, Jianhua",Jianhua.Tong@clemsonuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Solar thermochemical fuel (e.g., hydrogen) production based on the redox cycles of metal oxides has a promising theoretical solar-to-fuel efficiency of ~40% because of harvesting all solar spectra. However, the demonstrated solar-to-fuel efficiency was only ~3%, ascribed to the available materials’ poor redox properties (small redox capacity, sluggish redox kinetics, high reduction temperature, low water or carbon dioxide conversion, and low fuel concentration). However, most of the available perovskite oxides are not located in the thermodynamic favorable solar thermochemical region under realistic redox conditions. The high water or carbon dioxide concentration (e.g., 40vol.% water balanced by argon) was used to make the redox reactions occur, which was the reason for low water or carbon dioxide conversion rate, low fuel concentration, and sluggish water splitting or carbon dioxide splitting kinetics. The multiple dopants in the A and B sites of perovskite structures allow the formation of high-entropy perovskite oxides with large configuration entropies. Therefore, in this work, we expect to increase the reduction entropies of the doped perovskite oxides by forming high-entropy perovskite oxides to move the oxide’s thermodynamics into the thermodynamic favorable solar thermochemical region, ensuring the achievement of promising solar thermochemical materials by resolving the low-temperature oxidation challenges. The conventional computational/experimental methods are either too slow or too expensive to discover solar thermochemical high-entropy perovskite oxides because of their exceptionally complicated and infinite compositions. In this work, we first develop a machine learning prediction methodology and establish a laser-based high throughput experimental platform for rapidly discovering new high-entropy perovskite oxides as promising solar thermochemical materials. The predicted high-entropy perovskite oxides with proper nonstoichiometric oxygen amount under realistic high-temperature reduction and low-temperature oxidation conditions (proper temperature and pressure) are submitted for testing redox properties to select solar thermochemical candidates. After that, we evaluate, characterize, and understand the discovered high-performance solar thermochemical materials to study high-entropy perovskite oxides as solar thermochemical materials fundamentally and practically. Objectives of the project, “redox cycles of novel high-entropy perovskite oxides for clean fuel production through solar thermochemical water and carbon dioxide splitting”, are to establish a partnership between Clemson University (Clemson) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to to prove the feasibility of using redox cycles of novel high entropy perovskite oxides to produce clean fuel (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or synthesis gas) through solar thermochemical water and carbon dioxide splitting. Three objectives are targeted to achieve this goal: 1) develop a machine learning methodology for discovering new high-entropy perovskite oxides as solar thermochemical candidates, 2) establish a high throughput experimental platform for synthesizing and screening high-entropy perovskite oxides rapidly, and 3) evaluate, characterize, and understand the discovered high-performance solar thermochemical materials. The desired project outcome is to prove the feasibility of solar thermochemical fuel production (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and synthesis) and carbon dioxide removal utilizing a machine learning-based discovery approach discovering new energy materials for practical hydrogen production technologies and strengthen the collaboration between ORNL and Clemson University."

Korea). This project will further contribute to US Fusion Energy Sciences program goals by obtaining new understanding and answering critical questions in scenario and long pulse control research, primarily focused on ITER operational needs. The research will help develop the control methods and algorithms necessary for improving access to Q=10 ITER scenarios and their extension to include ITER-like ramp-up and ramp-down phases. Experiments will be conducted after the installation of the new Tungsten divertor planned for KSTAR in late 2022. The project will work synergistically with US domestic research at DIII-D, NSTX, and beyond, helping to maximize U.S. impact on the worldwide fusion efforts, support ITER, and will help to accelerate the KSTAR program. Project Description: The long pulse Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR, in South Korea) provides key opportunities for the United States (U.S.) collaboration to enable study and optimize ITER scenarios and control issues in a long pulse device with a tungsten divertor and reactor-relevant constraints of distant superconducting coils and a tungsten divertor. The project will be led by GA and performed by a team comprised of researchers from GA, PPPL, Lehigh, and ORNL. It will focus on improvement, demonstration and prediction of key ITER Q=10 scenarios on KSTAR, while qualifying ITER control solutions for disruption-free operation consistent with long pulse requirements. This research will advance U.S. leadership in areas critical for reliable operation and success for ITER, and help to position the U.S. for a key role in ITER scenarios and control. Studies of candidate Q=10 scenarios on short pulse devices have been largely limited to discharge durations comparable to or less than a resistive relaxation time. Qualification of ITER inductive scenarios on existing long pulse devices (i.e., for many resistive relaxation times and approaching or exceeding wall particle equilibration times) should minimize the need for iterative scenario development on ITER, and reduce schedule risk for the ITER program. Many control solutions needed to sustain these scenarios are being developed on short pulse devices and require extension to long pulse. Making use of achievements from previous efforts on KSTAR and DIII-D, this project will improve and extend KSTAR’s ITER Q=10 Baseline Scenario, study of ITER-like ramp-up and ramp-down, and develop the control for extending the Advanced Inductive “Hybrid” scenarios on KSTAR to the ITER shape. Enabling and supporting control solutions for scenario maintenance and disruption-free operation will be synergistically developed to aid in the scenario development and produce critical control tools for ITER. Simulations and real-time control algorithms will be developed and qualified for ITER scenario planning and optimization on KSTAR, including demonstration of gain-control during long pulse operation, assessment of effects on performance and scenario access with the new tungsten divertor, qualification of ITER continuous control and Exception Handling (EH) algorithms, development of response models and control solutions for scenario control, and the development of robust real-time disruption avoidance and prevention tools."

Simulating a composition of many interacting quantum systems is classically intractable due to the long-range entanglement present across an exponentially large space of states. However, for many practical applications, such as in the optimization of lithium-ion batteries, and the development of novel materials for superconductors and fusion energy, the ability to simulate quantum many-body systems is of critical importance. Quantum computation has been proposed for the efficient simulation of quantum many-body systems, and a variety of quantum algorithms have been developed for solving the ground state problem. This project is focused on the quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) algorithms, which are a family of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, and have two basic steps. The first step is to prepare a generalized Krylov space which is a subspace of states that contains a good approximation to the low-energy eigenstates of the quantum many-body system. The second step is to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem for the restriction of the quantum many-body system to the generalized Krylov space. The objective of this project is to develop mathematical methods for QSD algorithms; focusing on understanding and improving robustness, efficiency, and scalability of these algorithms. The methods being developed will apply widely across various instances of QSD algorithms and enhance the range of their applicability to a large family of physical models. Our approach is inspired by and adapted from recent developments of mathematical methods for quantum spin systems, such as the quasi-adiabatic evolution and the polynomial approximation of ground states."

Artificial photosynthesis addresses the intermittency issue by using solar energy to generate storable fuels. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices directly couple solar absorption and fuel production within a single device, an approach that has long-term potential for sustainable energy with low environmental impact. Current PEC systems, however, suffer from limited efficiency and durability. These devices involve the integration of several functional materials into layered architectures, and losses at different interfaces between the layers are one major limitation on overall efficiency. Therefore, several key interfaces relevant to PEC devices will be studied using recently developed techniques, particularly leveraging interface-sensitive Soft X-ray Second Harmonic Generation (SXSHG). SXSHG is a technique that combines elemental selectivity, sensitivity to electronic structure, and extreme interfacial sensitivity to probe carrier dynamics at interfaces. By comparing bulk sensitive measurements with surface-sensitive SXSHG, performance loss mechanisms in PEC devices will be studied. Through a combination of time-resolved and steady-state measurements, the origin and location of crystal imperfections that lead to efficiency losses will be determined. This information will then directly inform the synthetic design of future PEC devices, improving their efficiency and long-term stability."

The vision of REMIND is to establish foundational scientific knowledge underpinning the function of biologically inspired materials and architectures that approach fundamental limits of computing energy efficiency and speed. Transmitting, storing, and processing data already account for ~10% of global energy use. Fifty zettabytes of data were collected in 2020, and that already enormous number (a zettabyte is 1021 bytes) is expected to grow a million-fold by 2040. The microelectronics industry is encountering roadblocks directly traceable to fundamental physical material and architectural constraints of present computing paradigms. While the energy efficiency of neural networks in the brain provides the motivation for biologically inspired information processing, no presently available material fulfills all the criteria required to realize the promise of brain-inspired “neuromorphic” computing. Significant breakthroughs in the fundamental science underpinning neuromorphic computation require competencies spanning many areas of science. REMIND brings together a diverse multidisciplinary team of academic and national lab scientists to discover and exploit new materials, mechanisms, and interfaces that are required to emulate or exceed specific information processing functions of the human brain performed by neurons and synapses. REMIND’s materials chemistry focus is to investigate low-energy transformations in two model systems – ion intercalation hosts and thin films of redox-active molecular complexes – as a means of mimicking neuron and synapse behavior. A central goal of the center is to create design rules that map neuronal/synaptic function to material/interfacial properties, in order to achieve 4 to 5 orders of magnitude improvements in speed and energy efficiency of neuromorphic analog computing over the current generation of scaled digital technology. To achieve this goal, the center will blend a traditional “forward design” approach (leveraging known material behavior to design systems that exploit known mechanisms) with “inverse design” (identifying and targeting material properties by starting from the desired neuromorphic function). The center will research new molecules, materials, interfaces, and circuit elements by leveraging a suite of advanced experimental and computational capabilities that include: DOE national user facilities, experimental toolsets for real-time interrogation of the neuron- and synapse-like functions in physical materials, and modeling approaches that capture discontinuous changes in electronic properties spanning many orders of magnitude in spatial (from the atomic to the scale of computing circuits) and temporal (femtoseconds to seconds) dimensions. Coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence frameworks, this approach will map desired neuronal and synaptic function to the static and dynamic structure and composition of molecules and materials, ultimately allowing REMIND to design the next generation of brain-inspired materials, devices, and architectures. The success of REMIND will be in providing a new scientific foundation for neuron- and synapse-like materials that enable intelligent and energy-efficient information processing inspired by living systems. The knowledge gained will pave the way to computing architectures with unprecedented efficiency, speed, and reconfigurability; “reboot” the microelectronics industry; usher in a new era of domestic semiconductor manufacturing, and through enablement of real-time AI, will lay the foundations for a new era of atom-precise transformative manufacturing."

Such applications are multi-scale in the sense that quantities of interest that we seek to measure at the macroscopic scale are strongly driven by effects at much smaller/shorter scales. While the enormous multi-decade national investment in massively parallel computational resources has had a transformational impact on fields as diverse as aircraft development, the understanding of complex biological processes, subsurface reservoir management, and weather predictions, many of the plasma-driven problems of critical importance remain computationally intractable due to their multi-scale character. This center is motivated by the need to develop accurate long-term modeling of plasma systems for fusion energy and national security that are suitable for optimization and uncertainty quantification at the engineering scale. Plasma-mediated thermonuclear fusion (the subject of a recent Summit at the White House) promises clean energy that is environmentally responsible, which is essential to the survival of the human race and the health of the planet. Thermonuclear fusion also plays an important role in National Security. Developing the mathematical and computational capabilities to address such currently intractable multi-scale problems in plasma science will provide us a means to truly impact both clean energy and national security realms and will make accessible new opportunities to leverage the unique behaviors of plasmas for other engineering applications. Led by Michigan State University and Los Alamos National Laboratory, CHaRMET brings together national leaders from five universities and four national labs in the mathematical modeling of plasmas. The center seeks to build a first-of-its-kind holistic approach that will exploit structure within models to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and to bridge a wide range of length and time scales in plasma science. The curse of dimensionality is a critical challenge that is pervasive throughout computational science and refers to the observation that the resources needed to solve a problem on a computer scale exponentially with the dimension of the problem. Fundamental plasma models are seven dimensional and are presently computationally intractable (with existing mathematical methods and computational resources) to drive optimization and uncertainty quantification at the engineering scale of plasma systems. The CHaRMNET team will take a holistic approach based on (1) a synergistic theoretical and data-driven approach to hierarchical modeling, including a wide range of surrogates; (2) next-generation multi-resolution, mixed-model algorithms that provide a self-adaptive structure in terms of the methods and the models; and (3) structure and asymptotic preserving algorithms that enforce model consistency throughout the model hierarchy. A key component will be a comprehensive characterization of error and uncertainty that will enable automated model selection in addition to facilitating robust design, control, and decision making."

By infecting soil microbes, viruses likely have substantial, as-yet unknown impacts on terrestrial biogeochemical processes under their hosts’ control. Viral particles (virions) may also play more direct roles in soil biogeochemical cycling as packets of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous, but the time scales and environmental conditions that determine virion infectivity, transport, and/or sorption to soil particles are unknown. This project will use a combination of laboratory and computational approaches to distinguish between infective and degraded virions and assess their respective contributions to soil biogeochemical cycling. Using a multi-omics approach, this research will establish spatiotemporal patterns in soil viral community composition and virus-host dynamics in forests, chaparrals, grasslands, and wetlands. In order to identify feedbacks between soil viruses and carbon dynamics in additional, changing environments, planned research includes field experiments after a high-temperature prescribed forest fire as well as in a boreal forest ecosystem, leveraging the US Department of Energy’s Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. By integrating the knowledge gained in the analysis of these different environmental conditions over time, this project will expand our understanding of the global soil virosphere and its influence on global biogeochemical cycles."
Application of aerosol-ice nucleating particle closure to establish the leading parameters governing ice crystal number concentration under commonly observed mixed-phase cloud conditions,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021034,"Knopf, Daniel",Daniel.Knopf@researchfoundationforthestateuniversityofnewyorkd/b/arfsuny-stonybrookuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","In the atmosphere, cloud and precipitation particles may be liquid- or ice-phase or a combination of both. While in recent years there has been tremendous progress in understanding how liquid-phase droplets are first formed (or nucleated), the nucleation of ice crystals has remained elusive. Where the air is too warm for droplets to spontaneously freeze (roughly –38°C), ice nucleation may be promoted by aerosol particles (submicrometer- and supermicrometer-sized airborne particulate matter) that can act as ice nucleating agents, but differing models for such nucleation give grossly differing results. Indeed, ice formation is considered one of the remaining grand challenges in the atmospheric sciences. Ice nucleation plays a crucial role in precipitation formation and alters the radiative properties of clouds, thereby affecting Earth’s climate system. The objectives of this project are to gain a predictive understanding of the chain that leads from aerosols to ice-nucleating particles to ice crystal number concentrations in stratiform mixed-phase clouds. This project takes a holistic bottom-up approach to linking aerosol particle properties to ice crystal number concentrations via the prediction of ice-nucleating particles. This will be achieved by a two-pronged approach. In the first step, we will perform a modeling closure analysis between simultaneously measured aerosol properties and ice-nucleating particle number concentrations using data obtained from U.S. DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement field campaigns. Namely, we will use the measured physicochemical parameters (e.g., size and composition) of the aerosol population to predict the observed number of ice-nucleating particles using different models, and then compare predictions with observations to evaluate the degree to which agreement is achieved when accounting for experimental uncertainties. Results will provide evaluation of the skill of differing models to accurately predict ice-nucleating particle number concentrations. In the second step, we will develop and apply a simplified model of supercooled stratiform mixed-phase clouds themselves, which will be constrained by long-term U.S. DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement observations and large eddy simulations. This simplified cloud model will allow us to further evaluate our predictive capability of ice crystal number concentrations from aerosol characteristics using differing ice nucleation models. The simplified cloud model will include a state-of-the-art particle-resolved aerosol model that allows to simulate the aerosol particle physicochemical properties in detail, needed to predict ice-nucleating particle number concentrations. The applied aerosol population will be driven by climate-model derived aerosol fields. This approach will assess our ability to achieve gross climatological agreement between simulated and observed aerosol properties and ice crystal number concentrations. Tasks can be broken down as follows: 1. We will advance our understanding of the aerosol physicochemical parameters that yield prediction of ice-nucleating particle number concentrations. We will employ field data of a recent U.S. DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement campaign that acquired aerosol properties and ice-nucleating particle number concentrations. Those data will also be placed in context with climate models typically used in the scientific community. 2. We will develop an aerosol-cloud column model. This involves long-term measurement statistics to generate realistic configurations of a simplified model for two common single-layer cloud types, suitable for efficient coupling to models of a range of different complexities that link aerosol properties to ice-nucleating particles. 3. We will examine how ice-nucleating particle number concentrations are linked to ice crystal number concentrations. We will use our model simulations to assess the parameters governing the relationship between aerosol, ice-nucleating particles, and ice crystal number concentrations with model-derived aerosol properties. Lastly, as a “reality check”, we will compare cloud parameter combinations generated by our models with long-term U.S. DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement observations. This research project seeks to guide concrete improvements in the current cloud and climate modeling approaches to ice formation by advancing understanding of the coupling between detailed aerosol physicochemical properties and in-cloud ice crystal number concentrations. Results will be particularly relevant to understanding how aerosol particles modify the ice formation process in mixed-phase clouds, which are key climate players."
QCD Description of Hadronic Interactions at High Energies,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0002145,"Stasto, Anna",Anna.Stasto@thepennsylvaniastateuniversity,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","QCD Description of Hadronic Interactions at High Energies Anna Stasto, Pennsylvania State University (principal investigator) Standard Model of particle physics is a fundamental theory which has been very successful in describing interactions of elementary particles. Its predictions have been very well tested in experiments in a wide range of scales. Despite this overwhelming success there are still many questions that are left unanswered. One of them is the dynamics of strong interactions at high energies, which is still not completely understood. This is of great importance since this is tested at high-energy collider experiments and in cosmic ray interactions. The aim of this proposal is to address the fundamental questions in the strong interactions in the limit of high energies or low Bjorken x through the formal and phenomenological analysis of variety of hadronic processes which can be probed in current and future high-energy accelerators. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the non-abelian quantum field theory of strong interactions. Due to the property of asymptotic freedom perturbative techniques have been very successful in description of the experimental data at short distance scales. In the high-energy limit standard techniques can be however insufficient, as it is expected that novel phenomena will appear in this regime. QCD predicts formation of a very dense partonic system in the highly energetic collisions as well as in collisions involving nuclear beams. This requires appropriate computational approach to describe accurately novel phenomena at small Bjorken x. The first goal in this project is to extend the resummation framework at small x previously developed by the PI and collaborators. In particular, PI intends to include the resummation of the higher order terms in impact factors for Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and match to the resummed evolution in the gluon channel. Interplay between the resummed evolution in this approach using the unintegrated gluon density and the gluon saturation effects will be investigated. Low x dynamics can be also tested in diffractive processes. Analysis of the potential of the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) to measure the diffractive structure functions will be performed. Studies of the momentum transfer dependence in diffractive structure functions will be done and the prospects in the context of EIC evaluated. Dissociative diffraction of vector mesons at large momentum transfers will be explored, using the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov non-forward evolution, also with resummation, in the context of current and future experimental data from electron-proton colliders. Studies in the context of photoproduction, also in the ultraperipheral collisions of nuclei are planned. Forward production in high energy collisions will be investigated within the small x framework. Predictions for the prompt neutrino fluxes originating from the heavy meson decays will be made, using the unintegrated gluon density at small x including resummation as well as saturation. Finally, impact of different fragmentation scenarios will be investigated."
Rigorous incorporation of pH effects into ab initio electrochemical models,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023410,"Peterson, Andrew",Andrew.Peterson@brownuniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Reducing the use of fossil fuels is one of the defining societal challenges of the coming decades. Arguably, the most crucial enabling technology to defossilize the energy and chemical sectors is electrochemistry, as it allows the interconversion of renewable electricity and chemical energy. This allows for the short-term storage of energy in batteries, the longer-term storage and distribution in the form of hydrogen and other chemical fuels, and the synthesis of chemical feedstocks that would otherwise be produced from fossil fuels. The ability to create electrochemical processes that operate in a highly efficient and low-cost manner is crucial to the success of defossilization efforts. Many electrochemical reactions involve the reaction of a proton at an electrode; prominent examples include water splitting to create ""green"" hydrogen, carbon dioxide electroreduction to create climate-neutral fuels, and nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia fertilizer. In all of these reactions the pH within the electrochemical device plays a crucial role, as it controls the thermodynamics of the proton in the reaction. Experimentally, many large effects have been observed to occur when the operating pH of an electrochemical cell is changed, which cannot be explained based upon simple thermodynamic driving-force arguments. Performing the basic research to rigorously understand these phenomena at the ab initio level---that is, via electronic structure calculations---is the aim of this proposal. In this project, we will use new simulation techniques developed by researchers at Brown University and at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to elucidate the effect of pH from first-principles calculations. First, we will develop a fully consistent grand-canonical treatment of how pH effects can be separated from electrode potential effects computationally; this is enabled by electronically grand-canonical calculations, specifically the ""solvated jellium method"" (SJM) developed in Peterson's group. Crucial to this approach is the separation of electron-transfer effects across the stages of an elementary reaction, which are only possible in an electronically grand-canonical simulation protocol. We will further uncover the specific role of ions in affecting the energetics and kinetics of reactions in a two-pronged approach. In the first, we will use a joint quantum-mechanics / continuum-mechanics approach to describe ion distributions in water, in a method whose use has been pioneered at LLNL and developed by an alum of the Quantum Simulations Group. In the second, we will use newly-developed grand-canonical machine-learning approaches developed at Brown University to directly assess the effect of ions in solution in explicit calculations, providing both validation and complementary information to the joint approach. By developing rigorous, thermodynamically consistent frameworks to describe pH effects in electrochemistry, we expect that the basic research of this proposal will explain many counter-intuitive phenomena that occur in electrochemical cells. This basic research will pave the way for the development of more efficient and earth-abundant materials and devices for the interconversion of electrical and chemical forms of energy, enabling an efficient transition to a fossil-free world."

These models will simulate all stages of a polymer composite’s life cycle and include uncertainty and Energy-Environment-Economy (E3) impact quantification. Methods: The DLC will enable the generation of a large quantity of high-fidelity data for the training of AI models. Equipped with these data, we will develop new AI models, including physical informed neural networks and multiscale deep neural operators, to efficiently map the composite materials’ architecture and the manufacturing process to composite components’ performance. Next, we will develop a conditional Variational Autoencoders (VAE) neural network for material inverse design and a conditional VAEGAN neural network for manufacturing process design. Third, we will develop an uncertainty quantification neural network for in situ manufacturing diagnosis and control. Utilizing the experimental facility and capabilities at the Clemson Composites Center, the Center for Manufacturing Innovation at the University of Florida, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and other BES facilities and infrastructure, we will conduct material characterization and testing of mechanical, physical, rheological, and morphological properties at nano-, micro-, and macroscales to inform and validate DLC and AI models and simulations. Impact: This project will develop AI-enabled, cloud-based, inverse design tools that can accelerate the discovery and manufacturing of new high-performance composite materials. If successful, we envision that the inverse design paradigm can be equally applied to other materials systems such as metals/alloys and ceramic matrix composites with applications in the automotive, aerospace, civil, and defense industries. In addition, the radically different inverse design approach proposed in this EFRC program will impact the way young researchers think of composite manufacturing and bring a unique opportunity to prepare the American workforce for the future of the advanced manufacturing industry."

However, the diamond ablator material used in this experiment displays detrimental effects due to the development of hydrodynamic instabilities at the diamond/fuel interface under shock compression. New alternatives to diamond ablators are required to step up the energy yield in ICF experiments and overcome the 1.9-megajoule ignition threshold. The unique combination of mechanical strength (approaching that of diamond), the ability to accommodate high-Z dopants (in contrast to diamond), and the tunability of the properties (through synthesis material with varying sp3 content) make amorphous carbon (a-C) a promising material for next-generation of ICF ablative capsules. However, despite its critical importance to the ICF program, the behavior of a-C carbon at extreme temperatures and pressures remains largely unexplored. The primary goals of this joint project are to perform groundbreaking dynamic compression experiments and predictive simulations to uncover the fundamental high-energy-density physics of amorphous carbon. Our hypothesis-driven scientific goals are (1) to uncover the metastability range of amorphous carbon and probe phase transitions to diamond or metastable supercooled liquid carbon; (2) to acquire high-quality equation of state (EOS) data and develop an experimentally validated EOS from machine-learning MD simulations of the complex states of carbon; and (3) to uncover the complex behavior of carbon liquid in both thermodynamically stable and metastable supercooled states by accessing large areas of carbon phase diagram with amorphous samples with variable sp3 content. Our proposed experimental program includes equation of state and diffraction measurements using the Omega EP laser at the Laboratory of Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester and an investigation the structure and bonding of a-C under isothermal compression at the HPCAT sector of Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. The theoretical/simulation program involves the development of machine-learning models of the complex response of amorphous carbon under dynamic compression by performing molecular dynamics simulations at experimental time and length scales using leadership class DOE supercomputers. Simulations will guide experiments to observe predicted phenomena and acquire critical experimental data in specific pressure-temperature domains to validate theoretical models. The research will deliver fundamental properties of novel amorphous carbon ICF ablator material, including phase diagram and EOS. These results will aid in ICF target design and ICF implosion experiments. A unique combination of predictive simulations and dynamic and static experiments will provide a highly inspirational intellectual environment for nurturing the graduate students and postdocs involved in this project."

While the longevity of these products from a consumer perspective is a positive, the persistence of per- and polyfluoroorganic substances (PFAS) in the environment has had unintended consequences. Some volatile PFAS (perfluorocarbons or PFCs, and hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs) are by-products of energy-intensive manufacturing of aluminum, magnesium, or semiconductors, while others (freons and HFCs) are or were widely used refrigerants. These gaseous PFAS accumulate in the atmosphere and are some of the most potent “super-greenhouse gases” produced by industrialized humanity. Non-volatile, water-soluble PFAS acids, such as PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA, once used as surfactants in fluoropolymer production and in aqueous fire-fighting foams (AFFFs), have recently been shown to be carcinogenic, highly persistent, and widely spread in the environment and the biota. Development of new, effective methods for the destruction of existing PFAS stockpiles and remediation of waste streams under mild conditions can bring meaningful benefits. Catalytic activation of C-F bonds under mild conditions has long been a fundamental challenge for chemists. The C-F bond is arguably the most robust functionality in organic chemistry, resisting many conventional approaches to the cleavage of carbon-element bonds. The difficulty increases for the highly fluorinated PFAS. The Ozerov group pioneered a novel approach to catalytic C-F bond activation which relies on the highly fluoridophilic silicon- and aluminum-centered cations as catalysts for the conversion of C-F bonds into C-H and C-C bonds. The main goal of the project is to develop improved catalytic methods for the conversion of the most challenging PFAS into environmentally benign materials, in addition to advancing the fundamental understanding of the underlying reactivity. The focus is specifically on achieving the conversion of PFCs as the most challenging class of PFAS, as well as the conversion of the oxygen-containing PFAS as the prevalent water-borne PFAS. In addition, the project aims to explore catalytic upscaling of fluorinated polymers with the goal of creating new polymer structures, and diminishing the environmental impacts and energy consumption in fluoropolymer production. All in all, the proposed research aims to deliver advances in environmental remediation, fundamental insight into a persistent problem, an array of new partially fluorinated polymers, as well as pushing the frontier of fundamental understanding of chemical reactivity in highly Lewis acidic environments."

However, microbial metabolism is often inefficient, and some microbes release up to 33% of carbon as carbon dioxide (CO2) waste. In principle, microbial metabolism could be rewired to efficiently conserve carbon or even directly sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, improving product yield and reducing net-carbon emissions generated by bioproduction. In practice, this task is time-consuming and resource-intensive due to our limited ability to model the impact of large-scale genetic engineering, combined with an inability to rapidly implement and test large genome-wide re-design programs. This interdisciplinary project aims at establishing a new paradigm for genome-wide engineering with versatile tools based on CRISPR gene programming approaches. These new engineering tools will simultaneously activate and repress dozens of genes. By combining these tools with high-throughput genome-wide gene expression analyses of individual cells, computational modeling, and metabolic engineering, this project will represent a dramatic advancement in microbial biodesign. This research will not only deliver novel and safe genome-wide redesign tools for multiple microbial species, but it will also develop strains with carbon-conserving mechanisms for next-generation biomanufacturing."

In order to engineer microalgae for efficient production of fuels and chemicals, it is necessary to understand their metabolism and how it is regulated at the whole-organism level. This project will study the unicellular green alga Chromochloris zofingiensis, which naturally accumulates high levels of oil as a carbon storage product, making it a promising biofuel feedstock. This alga also has a unique metabolic flexibility and can reversibly switch between growth modes with different levels of oil production.

These catalysts are complex, comprising multi-component materials and complex structures, making their rational design challenging, if not impossible in most cases. Furthermore, typical active metals like Ni, Pt, Pd, and Rh can be susceptible to poisoning by CO, coking, and they are not always 100% selective. To address these issues the Sykes group is taking a new approach, combining surface science and advanced microscopy, to develop a novel class of metal alloy catalysts called Single-Atom Alloys (SAAs). SAA catalysts constitute one of just a few examples of when heterogeneous catalyst design has been guided by an atomic-level understanding of fundamental surface chemical processes. We have already shown that expensive catalytic metals like Pt, Pd and Rh can be used at the ultimate limit of atom efficiency for industrially important selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. We will extend this approach to selective epoxidation reactions by identifying SAAs that have favorable energetics for O2 activation and weak binding of the dissociated O atoms, which are key factors in active and selective oxidation reactions. Industrially, the direct oxidation of ethylene by oxygen on Ag catalysts can reach ~85% selectivity by using promoters such as Cl and Cs, but must be operated at low conversion to maintain selectivity and avoid total combustion of ethylene to carbon dioxide. We hypothesize that the SAA concept will enable the design of alloy surfaces that reduce the O2 dissociation barrier, thereby enabling higher conversions, and also potentially reducing the catalyst operating temperature so that less ethylene oxide is lost to decomposition on the catalyst support. Collectively, the results of this research will yield critical information for the heterogeneous catalysis community and guide their quest to rationally design the next generation of SAA catalysts for selective oxidation reactions."

In the process, we will develop insights into the mechanisms by which abiotic materials interact with enzymes to stabilize and/or “heal” them. These biocatalysts will also serve as highly tunable systems to test fundamental questions about how the efficiency of one-pot cascade reactions depends on the selectivity and activity of catalysts for independent steps.

Elucidating Grain Growth in Thermo-Magnetic Processed Materials by Transfer Learning and Reinforcement Learning,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023380,"Krause, Amanda",Amanda.Krause@carnegiemellonuniversity,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","The goal of this proposal is to develop a physics-regulated interpretable machine learning model to elucidate one of the most fundamental, yet poorly understood, mechanisms in materials science: abnormal grain growth. We propose that by identifying a physical indicator of abnormal grain growth, we can start to uncover the true local driving force for all grain boundary (GB) motion. Currently, curvature is assumed to be the local driving force but recent experimental observations have revealed that GB curvature cannot be correlated to GB motion in real polycrystalline materials. Furthermore, there is conflicting evidence of the impact of anisotropic GB behavior on grain growth. We propose that abnormal grain growth represents an extreme case that can serve as a convenient guide to identifying the impact of GB anisotropy on local GB motion. The hypothesis driving this work is that grains exhibiting abnormal grain growth are those grains that have a sufficient number of asymmetric triple junctions to sustain a growth advantage. Asymmetric triple junctions (i.e., deviating from 120°) are the result of a significant energy difference between neighboring boundaries. Therefore, we assume that local motion near asymmetric junctions will facilitate the preferential annihilation of high energy boundaries to sustain growth of particular grains. Our proposed approach to elucidate abnormal grain growth is to build a machine learning model that captures GB motion observed in real polycrystalline materials captured with non-destructive x-ray diffraction microscopy (3D-XRM). The benefit of this approach is that such a model does not rely on physical assumptions and can create higher order representations to address the complexity of the GB network. Our team has built a deep learning Physics-Regulated Interpretable Machine Learning Microstructure Evolution (PRIMME) model that can simulate isotropic grain growth. Although PRIMME acts as an independent grain growth model, comparable to Monte Carlo Potts (MCP) or phase field models, it is based on data rather than physical assumptions. This study will expand this model to describe real anisotropic grain growth behavior by training with contiguous experimental data from iron and alumina collected using 3D-XRM. This non-destructive technique is essential to the success of this project as it will give 4D (space + time) to track GB motion. From this data, PRIMME will learn the anisotropic GB motion that is necessary for abnormal grain growth. Then, using the unique architecture of PRIMME, we will test our hypothesis by using PRIMME’s interpretable actions to determine how the presence of asymmetrical triple junctions correlates to abnormally-fast growing grains. Furthermore, we will employ crystallographic texture, which controls GB energy distribution, as a tool to change the spatial distribution of the asymmetrical triple junctions. The texture is introduced here through thermomagnetic processing, which is highly desirable because it applies to ceramics and metals and does not impose any strain gradients that can be secondary driving forces for grain growth. A critical test for our hypothesis is to assess the accuracy of PRIMME predictions for textured samples after training with only randomly oriented polycrystalline samples. If our hypothesis is true, PRIMME will have “learned” which triple junctions are necessary for accelerated growth and can be applied to any system regardless of their GB character distribution. This work will be completed using the following objectives: 1. Identify Critical Microstructure Information for Anisotropic Growth Predictions 2. Capture True Grain Growth with Non-Destructive X-Ray Diffraction Microscopy 3. Interpret and Explain the Spatial Relationship of Asymmetric Triple Junctions to Understand Abnormal Grain Growth By testing our hypothesis, we will identify if triple junctions are indicators of local motion. Therefore, the study has the potential to elucidate not only the cause of abnormal grain growth but also the mechanisms underlying all grain growth behavior. The produced anisotropic grain growth model can then be used to help grain growth predictions and guide processing pathways for particular microstructures with desirable properties."

In particular, chemistry-relevant problems, such as light-harvesting and electron transfer reactions, are investigated. A quantum simulator emulates the behavior of the system under investigation using engineered interactions in well-controlled quantum systems. In contrast to the natural processes under investigation, the parameters of a quantum simulator are continuously adjustable across a wide spectrum. This capability allows tuning of the dynamics through different regimes and thus enables critical insights into quantum many-body processes. Although many of the practically relevant quantum processes take place in a noisy environment, almost all current quantum simulation approaches fail to adequately account for external noise sources or the interaction of the quantum system with its environment. This project develops methods to simulate dynamically evolving quantum systems interacting with their structured environment of varying classical and quantum complexity. This research promises to pave the way towards clarifying the roles of classical and quantum noise in quantum systems, with a specific focus on light-harvesting and electron transfer reactions."
Quantum algorithms for solving partial differential equations in engineering sciences,Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research,DE-SC0023273,"Whaley, Birgitta",Birgitta.Whaley@theregentsofuniversityofcalifornia,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","The advent of quantum information processing has led to the development of a number of quantum algorithms that promise improved scaling over corresponding classical algorithms. While much attention has focused on algorithms for optimization, linear algebra, and machine learning, in the sciences a great deal of effort has focused on efficient simulation of quantum mechanical phenomena, including both direct simulation of the quantum dynamics of physical systems and the use of such simulations to enable the calculation of energy eigenstates of physical Hamiltonians. Considerably less effort has been dedicated to the development of quantum algorithms targeting classical problems in the engineering and applied sciences. Quantum simulation of classical dynamical phenomena is characterized by two key challenges: in classical settings the dynamics may be non-linear and/or non-unitary. Quantum mechanics, and thus quantum computation, requires that real time dynamics be both unitary and linear. To tackle the non-linear nature of classical dynamics, computational scientists and engineers have developed the finite element method (FEM), in which a physical system is linearized in a functional basis. While this bas been used to great advantage in solving a broad range of partial differential equations in the engineering sciences, there has been no significant exploration to date of a quantum implementation of the FEM. On the other hand, the quantum algorithms community has addressed the issue of non-unitarity, with the proposal to employ a block-encoding framework that embeds a non-unitary system into a larger system that acts unitarily. This proposal will build on these landmark developments from classical and quantum computational science to develop and benchmark explicit block-encoded quantum algorithms inspired by the finite element method that can be applied to the quantum solution of partial differential equations. Our goal is thus to address the linearization of partial differential equations within the FEM, while also addressing the unitarity of the real time dynamics by employing block-encoding of the matrix representation of the dynamical equations. The proposed research will address the two core components of the above program in turn. We shall first undertake a careful quantum computational study of the matrix inversion component of the FEM, exploring the potential of the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) and block-encoding to facilitate this for realistic problem instances. A major task here will be explicit construction of quantum circuits for block-encoding of the FEM stiffness matrix. In the second phase of our study we shall combine this analysis with the Galerkin weak representation approach to solve partial differential equations using FEM-inspired basis sets. We shall build here on analogies with quantum computational approaches to quantum chemistry that employ Galerkin discretization. These methods will be applied to selected time-independent and time-dependent partial differential equations describing several benchmark problems in solid and fluid dynamics. We shall characterize both the asymptotic scaling and the practical computational expense in typical applications of quantum algorithms for FEM relative to state-of-the-art classical algorithms. Overall, we seek to develop quantum algorithms for solving problems in classical continuum mechanics achieving improved scaling over their classical counterparts, with emphasis on construction of quantum algorithms allowing superpolynomial reduction in scaling for systems with non-trivial boundaries that require billions of mesh elements in classical treatments. If successful, this approach will provide a new avenue for the development of explicit quantum algorithms for many problems in classical and quantum applied sciences."

Selective Oxidation of Oxygenates with Well-Defined Gold-Based Surface Catalytic Sites,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023119,"Zaera, Francisco","Francisco.Zaera@theregentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,riverside","['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Selective Oxidation of Oxygenates with Well-Defined Gold-Based Surface Catalytic Sites Prof. Francisco Zaera The Regents of the University of California, Riverside, Riverside, California Our project is designed to address the issue of selectivity in oxidation reactions with oxygenates by using well-defined gold-based catalysts. Selectivity has increasingly become a key criteria to design less energy consuming and greener processes, to reduce the consumption of feedstocks, avoid the need for separation and purification steps, and minimize the generation of potentially polluting byproducts. Catalytic selectivity is particularly important in the oxidation of organic compounds, where the ultimate, thermodynamically favored, products are CO2 and H2O; stopping at more interesting partially oxidized products requires a level of kinetic control that has in many instances eluted the catalysis community. A promising option for the promotion of selective partial oxidation reactions is gold-based catalysis, with which the reactions may be carried out at low temperatures and by using molecular oxygen as the oxidant. Many fundamental studies have been reported aiming to develop an understanding of how gold-based oxidation catalysis function, yet final consensus on a molecular-level mechanism for these reactions has still not been reached. What is needed is a way to systematically control and tune structural parameters such as the size of the metal nanoparticles and the nature of the support in order to design and optimize the catalytic sites at the metal/oxide interfaces that are known to play a central role in this chemistry. The main hypothesis underpinning this project is that the self-assembly synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) and the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of metal oxide thin films can be combined to design novel multicomponent metal/oxide surface sites on solid materials in order to target specific oxidation catalysis. A three-prone approach is used, to synthesize novel Au-based catalysts for the selective oxidation of oxygenates, characterize their catalytic sites at a molecular level, and study their catalytic mechanism and performance to provide the feedback require for future improvements. It is our contention that the design of catalysts and the tailoring of their chemistry can be carried out in a more flexible and precise way when modifying their surfaces using metal self-assembly NP synthesis and ALD rather than attempting to generate the desired properties directly during the preparation of bulk solids. Our surface-modification approach is being implemented in a modular way in order to add flexibility to the catalyst design, targeting the creation of well-defined metal/mixed-oxide sites. The catalysts prepared with our approach are to be tested for the partial oxidation of multifunctional oxygenates, focusing on biomass feedstocks such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and glycerol, with the purpose of developing new mechanistic insights and optimizing catalytic performance. Our research aims to provide an understanding of the atomic details of the redox and acid-base chemistry associated with partial oxidation reactions promoted by gold-based catalysts and to develop new synthetic ways to make better catalysts for such reactions with well-defined metal/mixed-oxide sites. The strength of this project is that it addresses the need to develop the fundamental principles behind the rational design of catalysts, with emphasis on the synthesis of catalytic sites designed to tune catalytic activity and selectivity, and on the study of structure-reactivity relationships of catalytic materials supported on solids. At a general and fundamental level, our research should advance new ways to look into and think about structure-reactivity relationships in catalysis, placing emphasis on the dynamic nature of catalytic surfaces under reaction conditions."

For example, the interfaces between a material with strong spin-orbit coupling and a superconductor can host an unusual form of superconductivity known as topological superconductivity. Over the past decade, the possibility of realizing topological superconductivity has generated much excitement in the field, mainly due to the potential use of its excitations (i.e. Majoranas) in fault-tolerant topological quantum computations. Magnetic topological insulator, a material with very strong spin-orbit coupling whose hallmark is the quantum anomalous Hall effect, provides a natural platform to pursue topological superconductivity and Majorana physics. In this project, we use molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to synthesize heterostructures formed by two magnetic materials, a ferromagnetic topological insulator layer and an antiferromagnetic iron chalcogenide layer, specifically Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3/FeTe. By performing in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S), and ex-situ electrical transport, reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RCMD), and magnetic force microscopy (MFM) measurements, we systematically investigate and understand the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism and explore topological interfacial superconductivity in these MBE-grown heterostructures. Our successful synthesis of superconducting heterostructures formed with two magnetic materials and the exploration of the topological interfacial superconductivity and Majorana physics therein will provide an alternative approach for the development of topological quantum computations."

The boundary plasma first acts as an insulator for the burning fusion plasma in the core, much like the walls of a Thermos bottle. But, the boundary plasma also interacts with the surrounding solid walls, potentially damaging the wall surfaces and producing in the process impurity atoms that can cool and dilute the core plasma, slowing the fusion reactions. Progress towards understanding and predicting the boundary plasma has been elusive because the dynamics of individual plasma particles must be taken into account and the small-scale physics at the individual particle motion level interact with the large scale collective physics at the device scale level; simpler approaches in which the plasma is characterized only by average properties have not fared well. This challenge is exacerbated by the boundary region&rsquo;s complex geometry. The XGC suite of advanced high fidelity kinetic simulation codes, run on extreme-scale computers, is designed to address the physics challenges arising in this boundary region. XGC uses first-principles based equations to maximize physics fidelity, with the degree of fidelity increasing as the capabilities of leadership class computers continue to grow.

G. Van de Walle, Materials Department, University of California, Santa Barbara Light emission from solid-state light emitters is still suffering from limited efficiency. We are developing and applying new theoretical approaches to uncover the fundamental reasons for efficiency limitations. Our initial focus was on nitride light emitting diodes (LEDs) because of their crucial impact on solid-state lighting. However, the first-principles methodology that we develop is general and can be applied to other materials as well as other types of devices. Understanding the microscopic origin of various physical pathways that lead to those losses is key to the design and improvement of future devices. Our methodology is based on density functional theory using hybrid functionals, the supercell approach for point defects, and first-principles treatment of electron-phonon interactions. For halide perovskites, which have demonstrated remarkable efficiencies as solar cells, we have already clarified the potentially misleading concept of “defect tolerance”. Our work clearly demonstrates that point defects play an equally important role in these materials as in conventional semiconductors, and we will continue to characterize relevant defects and propose ways to control or suppress them, for instance through passivation. We will also investigate mechanisms of light-induced degradation, and address the stabilization of all-inorganic perovskites. For nitride semiconductors, still the key materials for solid-state lighting, we will focus on identifying defects that cause nonradiative recombination in wider-bandgap materials through mechanisms such as “impurity Auger recombination” or involvement of excited states. We will also build on our studies of PbSe to address Auger recombination processes in other IV-VI compounds, and develop deeper insights into the mechanisms that govern Auger processes in this important class of materials with applications in infrared emitters and detectors and also as topological materials. Our expertise in nonradiative recombination will also be applied to a new class of group-IV-based light emitters based on hexagonal phases of Si and Ge. In addition to producing important results for technology, we will continue developing methodology, focusing on impurity Auger processes, treatment of excited states, description of polarization fields, and better approximations for electron-phonon interactions. Advanced first-principles techniques provide microscopic insights that would be impossible to achieve based purely on experiment. Our goals are to elucidate the underlying physical mechanisms, as well as to use our unique methodology to produce important and timely results for materials that are currently of high technological interest.

But in energy conversion applications such as lighting and solar energy harvesting, electrons exhibit a major limitation – they cannot be created or destroyed without breaking the law of charge conservation. Consequently, electronic technologies are typically ineffective when applied to important nonlinear problems such as the fusion of two infrared photons into one visible photon, or the fission of one visible photon into two infrared photons. Overcoming this long-standing limitation could boost the performance and lower the cost of solar cells and reduce the energy consumption of solid-state lighting. To achieve this goal, we use excited states in molecules, known as excitons, to mediate the flow of energy. Mastering the properties of excitons offers the ability to guide energy at the nanoscale and transform it with a flexibility that is impossible in conventional systems. We have two specific aims: first, to couple exciton fission to silicon, thereby increasing the potential efficiency of the world’s predominant solar cell technology from below 30% to above 35%, and second, to demonstrate a new approach to exciton fusion that doubles its potential efficiency from 40% to 80%.

The engineered microbes will be designed with minimized genomes that will make them incapable of proliferating outside the laboratory. By iteratively engineering and analyzing microbial strains, the project will also generate systems-level knowledge of the biology of those microorganisms, advancing BER's goal of understanding the fundamental rules that drive microbial systems to develop novel approaches for biological design while facilitating innovations that enable a true circular bioeconomy."
The Baltimore Social-Environmental Collaborative IFL,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023217,"Zaitchik, Benjamin",Benjamin.Zaitchik@thejohnshopkinsuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","The Baltimore Social-Environmental Collaborative (BSEC) seeks a new paradigm for urban climate research. Inspired by the Urban IFL call to provide knowledge that informs equitable solutions that can strengthen community-scale resilience, we propose a people-centered, transdisciplinary IFL. BSEC begins with community priorities (human health and safety, affordable energy, transportation equity, and others) and city government priorities (clean waterways, decarbonization, functioning infrastructure) and designs observation networks and models that will deliver the climate science capable of supporting those priorities. This means that BSEC takes the form of an iterative collaborative cycle, in which an initial observation and modeling strategy is continuously updated in conversation with community partners. The guiding objective of this cycle is to produce the urban climate science needed to inform community-guided “potential equitable pathways” for climate action. In doing so, we address a number of fundamental urban science questions from across natural science and social science disciplines. BSEC focuses on Baltimore, a metropolitan area that is representative of the climate challenges faced by many mid-sized industrial cities in the United States, and in particular with eastern “rust belt” cities that face interlinked challenges of aging infrastructure, stagnant populations, increased heat and flood risk, and inequitable burdens of air and water pollution. These cities are challenging and critical places for equitable climate solutions. The BSEC Equitable Pathways approach aligns urban science with information needs through coupled cycles of model and observation improvement and participatory assessment of climate risks in the context of multiple, potentially competing priorities. Recognizing that city residents and institutions have diverse and sometimes competing goals, we place a multi-objective analysis tool at the center of our project plan. This analysis tool offers an integrating nexus to inform and challenge urban climate science with the decision needs of the residents and stakeholders who ultimately determine the success of climate action. We will deploy advanced urban environmental measurement networks combined with the best urban models available. The model-data observatory will document urban microclimate, hydrology and air quality, indoor and outdoor, with unparalleled resolution and encompass the processes that govern these critical state variables. The model improvement cycle that uses these data and models to develop the best possible urban climate modeling systems will be informed by and adapt to community needs, creating a truly community-centered urban climate observatory. Equitable climate solutions begin with community knowledge. The role of a solutions-oriented urban IFL is to amplify and enhance that knowledge, and this is only possible when there is mutual trust and respect across all project partners. The BSEC team includes collaborators from neighborhood organizations, city government, non-government community development organizations, federal environmental and research agencies, and academic researchers from a wide range of disciplines. Together, we will build a collaborative urban science framework that brings advanced measurement and observation methods into conversation with community and government deliberation on climate action. In doing so, the BSEC IFL will provide a model for community-oriented interdisciplinary urban science that advances climate solutions in Baltimore and that can be applied in many other metropolitan areas. We will also establish a new generation of urban climate scientists and urban modeling systems capable of supporting predictions and community planning across a wide range of urban areas."
Zentropy Theory for Transformative Functionalities of Magnetic and Superconducting Materials,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023185,"Liu, Zi-Kui",Zi-Kui.Liu@thepennsylvaniastateuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Entropy drives changes in macroscopic and quantum systems, which include magnetic and superconducting materials. The challenge is how to quantify the entropy of materials and the entropy change due to internal processes that dictate their macroscopic transformative functionalities with respect to external stimuli. This is because macroscopic functionalities of materials stem from assemblies of microscopic states (microstates) at all scales at and below the scale of the macroscopic state of the experimental observation (macrostate), while the state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) predict only the properties of individual microstates. The “zentropy” theory developed by the PI’s team provides a nested formalism that integrates three fundamental scientific domains: (1) DFT-based quantum mechanics for prediction of the entropy of each microstate, (2) Statistical mechanics among ergodic microstates, and (3) macroscopic thermodynamics represented by the integration of experimentally measured heat capacity under given constraints from the surroundings. The zentropy theory has been successfully applied to predict temperature-pressure and temperature-volume phase diagrams of simple magnetic materials such as Ce and Fe3Pt, including first- and second-order phase transitions, critical points, the divergence of thermal expansion, the anomaly in heat capacity, and the negative thermal expansion in Fe3Pt, with all input data predicted from DFT-based calculations and without empirical models and parameters. The proposed research aims to further develop the zentropy theory through applications to complex magnetic materials and superconductors under the hypothesis that the emergent properties of complex magnetic materials and superconductors can be predicted by statistical mechanics of ergodic microstates with their partition function Z computed from DFT-predicted free energies. The key objective is to develop approaches to systematically determine the types and number of microstates and the supercell size in DFT-based calculations through convergence of macroscopic functionalities. In addition to using scientific intuitions to guide the design of important microstates, the key innovation of the proposed research is to integrate the domain knowledge and the material-property-descriptor database with four million microstates, which is supported by our deep neural network machine learning models and integrated with our high-throughput DFT Tool Kit (DFTTK). For complex magnetic materials, one of the objectives is to develop approaches to calculate short-range ordering from the statistical distribution of each microstate. For superconductors, the superconducting and non-superconducting microstates will be delineated. The accomplishment of the proposed research objectives will not only enable us to have a better fundamental understanding of magnetic and superconducting transitions and their predictions through the integration of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, but also provide a systemized theoretical and computational framework to understand and predict other transformative functionalities. A new open-source software tool will be developed for the zentropy theory based on our existing open-source high-throughput thermodynamic modeling tools along with new short-courses and workshops, which will be incorporated into our existing global outreach cloud-based teaching portfolio through the nonprofit Materials Genome Foundation."

This is because crop water use vastly exceeds all other resource demands in any “well-to-wheels” assessment of bioenergy production. Yields of bioenergy crops, such as Sorghum bicolor, have increased through breeding and improved agronomy. However, the amount of biomass produced for a given amount of water use (water use efficiency, or WUE) has remained constant. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to implement novel technologies and methodologies in Sorghum and the model plant Setaria viridis to redesign the bioenergy feedstock Sorghum for optimal WUE. The research goals are to optimize the engineering of individual traits in leaves and roots to enhance WUE and to combine these individual engineering strategies to maximize WUE in a new and improved form of Sorghum. This engineering will be implemented with new genetic transformation technologies and novel approaches to regulate gene expression that will enable more control of where in the plant a gene acts and when it acts in response to environmental cues. Advanced measurement technologies will enable the physiological components of WUE to be studied faster and more accurately. Computational approaches will be used to identify new genes involved in these processes and to understand how the genes fit into regulatory networks throughout the plant. Combining the practice of engineering “design-build-test-learn” cycles with parallel studies of model and crop species will enable rapid experimental iterations leading to faster and substantial WUE improvements in bioenergy feedstocks, advancing towards the development of renewable and sustainable bioenergy resources."

Unfortunately, the addition of photovoltaic systems on commercial and industrial buildings is often rendered difficult, expensive, or prohibitive due to several factors, including: Material, labor and logistics costs and complexity of standard photovoltaic systems with elaborate racking substructures and their restrictive grounding requirements. the structural limitations of many commercial and industrial roofs prohibit the use of heavy ballast to secure the systems, while invasive mounting by roof penetration is costly and increases the risk of roof leaks. a holistic approach addressing material and installation cost optimization and complexity reduction of module, inverter and balance-of-system as an integrated unit has not been undertaken successfully. The proposed photovoltaic system is based on an innovative photovoltaic module frame with integrated foldout racking structure. The novel system reduces racking material cost by 50% and provides a system deployable in one fifth of the time compared to standard photovoltaic systems. The proposed system has less than 40% of the weight load of standard systems and thus opens opportunities for installation on roofs that cannot withstand standard photovoltaic systems. The choice of frame and racking material removes the need for grounding the module and rack, saving significant cost, and removing a permanent safety liability. This cost and complexity reduction is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor and relies on thorough computational analysis of the integrated system’s strength to validate the design. In phase 1 the basic design of frame and racking system has been created and augmented with new support elements. Finite element analysis for snow and wind load has been carried out to establish and verify viability of a preferable geometry. A scaled down prototype has been manufactured using rapid prototyping. Factory side integration of optional microinverters and optimizers has been prepared. In phase II the selected basic system design will be optimized for strength and strength versus weight. Wind calculations and a wind tunnel study will be carried out to arrive at an optimized geometry. A manufacturing toolset will be designed, fabricated, and tested. A full-size prototype PV system will be manufactured and tested. The solution will enable installations by roofers or owners. The simplicity and low cost of the installation will help broaden the market to include lower income businesses. Phase III will be used for finalizing the development, third party and field testing and achieving certification with subsequent market introduction."

Knope, Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor, Department of Chemistry, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057 Developing an enhanced understanding of actinide chemical behavior is of great strategic and scientific importance to areas ranging from nuclear waste management to radiochemical separations chemistries. In comparison to the other elements of the periodic table, the chemical and physical properties of the actinide elements are uniquely complex and the behavior of these elements is often difficult to control and predict. Speciation (i.e. the complexes that form under a given set of conditions) is critical to describing the behavior of these metal ions. For the actinides, speciation depends largely on oxidation state, and our knowledge of the structural and energetic properties of tetravalent actinide (thorium, uranium, neptunium, and plutonium) complexes is quite limited. Particularly the speciation of Np and Pu, has posed significant challenges in our ability to predict actinide behavior under chemically complex conditions. To fill this knowledge gap, this research will systematically address the effects of (1) complexing ligands, (2) non-bonding interactions, and (3) functionalized surfaces on actinide speciation. These effects will be examined through the molecular-level structural characterization of tetravalent actinide phases formed in solution and the solid state using a suite of synthetic, spectroscopic, X-ray diffraction and scattering techniques. Through this multi-faceted experimental approach, in combination with complementary computational efforts, trends that govern speciation and reactivity in the early actinides will be identified, thus opening the door to greater control and predictive ability of the solution behavior of these elements. Fundamental insights into the factors that govern the speciation and reactivity of various structural units could lead to technological advances in separations, process chemistry, and the ability to predict the migration of these radionuclides in complex chemical systems. Compounds isolated as part of this work may also serve as a basis for theoretical studies focused on the electronic properties of the actinides and changes that occur with successive filling of the 5f orbitals, which may be critical to understanding how the electronic configuration of the metal ion affects the chemical and physical properties of these elements."
"Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Nanosheets with Emergent Properties
",Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0016144,"Lee, Seung-hun",Seung-hun.Lee@therectorandvisitorsoftheuniversityofvirginia,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Non-technical description: Discovery of new materials for optoelectronic devices is critically important for achieving long term prosperity and security of the United States. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have achieved striking success in various applications such as solar cells, light emitting diodes and photodetectors. HOIPs can be manufactured using low-cost solution processing methods, and yet, they can exhibit superb electronic quality that is on par with the state-of-the-art epitaxial grown semiconductors such as silicon and gallium arsenide. Moreover, the properties of HOIPs can be readily tuned by combining different organic molecules and inorganic components enabling construction of new materials with optimal properties for device applications.However, the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the tunability in optoelectronic properties of HOIPs are still poorly understood. The main objective of this proposed research is to reveal structure-dynamic-property relationships in HOIPs with different stacking sequence of organic molecules and two-dimensional nanosheets. The central hypothesis of this proposed research is that the structure and dynamics of organic molecules between the nanosheets will influence electronic and optical coupling across neighboring nanosheets and thus play a central role in determining the optoelectronic properties of 2D HOIP stacks. The research approach is to perform studies on HOIPs with systematically chosen compositions using a combination of materials synthesis, neutron scattering, muon scattering, optical and electrical measurements, magnetic property measurements and density functional theory calculations. Our proposed research, if successful, will reveal microscopic mechanisms behind the extremely high performance of HOIP based optoelectronic devices. The new insights will be transformative because it will enable rational selection of organic cations and inorganic components with optimized structure and dynamics to further improve device efficiency, stability and reliability. Technical Description: Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets of HOIPs can be considered to be quantum confined nanosheets with controllable structures and dimensions. Forming interfaces between two-dimensional nanomaterials gives rise to novel emergent phenomena that do not exist in individual components. 2D HOIPs provide the possibility of placing different organic molecules in between the 2D nanosheets, providing a transformative research opportunity to study how organic molecule dynamics interact with inorganic lattices in nanostructures and how their couplings give rise to new emergent properties. The central hypothesis of this proposed research is that the structure and dynamics of organic molecules between the nanosheets will influence electronic and optical coupling across neighboring nanosheets and thus play a central role in determining the optoelectronic properties of 2D HOIP stacks. The hypothesis will be tested using a combination of materials synthesis, neutron scattering, muon scattering, optical and electrical measurements on 2D HOIPs with systematically chosen compositions. The success of the proposed research will advance our understanding of microscopic mechanisms responsible for interaction between relevant degrees of freedom in photons and charges in HOIPs. This will help the field to construct materials by design with emergent properties tailored for various applications such as solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors and lasers."

We per- form research in experimental neutrino physics at the Intensity Frontier (DUNE, ProtoDUNE and T2K). The group continues their principal research efforts on the T2K and DUNE projects to measure neutrino oscillation parameters and study neutrino properties. Intensity Frontier - DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) : ProtoDUNE is a LAr prototype detector which was built in a charged-particle beam at CERN where it recorded data in 2018/2019. It uses the same technology that is planned for the DUNE far detector which will be exposed to a neutrino beam from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) with the goal to measure neutrino and anti-neutrino characteristics. In the context of ProtoDUNE we plan to continue to refine our selection of a pion sample for pion on argon cross section analyses, improve and finalize our Multiple Coulomb Scattering (MCS) based momentum estimate, select and study a beam Kaon sample and enhance the particle identification(PID) using machine learning algorithms. As a member of the DUNE high voltage (HV) consortium and based on our successful development, construction and quality control procedures for the detector field cage components for ProtoDUNE Kutter established his lab at LSU as a production site/factory to produce and assemble components for the DUNE far detector. We further optimize the detector design and will manufacture and construct field cage elements for ProtoDUNE II and successively perform detector construction work for the DUNE far detector modules. Under Tzanov’s initiative the group is also participating in the cold electronics consortium and focuses on testing, installa- tion, and commissioning of the DUNE far detector cold electronics. Intensity Frontier - T2K (Tokai to Kamiokande): T2K is one of the world’s leading neutrino oscillation experiments and its physics goals to measure neutrino properties have been recognized by a DOE portfolio review which placed the T2K physics program into the top most category. The experiment consists of a neutrino beam, a near detector complex and a far detector. We are analyzing T2K data to extract information on neutrino oscillation parameters and we improve the T2K oscillation analysis techniques and framework to further enhance the reach of our analysis. Furthermore, we are participating in a joint data analysis between T2K and the competing but also complementary NOvA experiment. The joint approach promises to yield better sensitivity to oscillation parameters than either experiment alone. The T2K near detector will be upgraded to provide better phase space coverage for neutrino interactions such that it more closely matches the isotropic response that the T2K water Cherenkov far detector (Super-Kamiokande) has. We work on simulation studies in preparation for future data from T2K running with an upgraded near detector. Based on previous work on the readout technology for super fine grained detector (SFGD) prototypes we develop and build the light readout board for the SFGD of the T2K near detector upgrade. An additional focus is on design, installation, and commissioning of some of its electronics components. We have exposed SFGD prototype detectors to a charged particle beam (CERN) and neutrons (LANSCE) and we now work on analysis of the recorded data and prepare results for publications. Kutter continues his leadership and management responsibilities for T2K and all team members help maintain the experimental setups and perform service tasks to the T2K and DUNE collaborations. Our research program makes contributions to our understanding of fundamental particles, in particular, neutrino properties. It also contributes to the education of a new generation of students and young scientists some of whom may become future leaders in science and other fields."

They bring about the same predictive computational abilities that have transformed gas-phase energy sciences to materials science and quantum device technologies that are increasingly crucial to the missions of DOE. With continued DOE support, we developed a large family of ab initio electron-correlation methods and their (parallel-execution) programs based on many-body perturbation (MP), coupled-cluster (CC), and many-body Green’s function (GF) theories for molecules (into DOE’s award-winning NWChem) and for solids. We also built a whole hierarchy of diagrammatic anharmonic vibrational MP, GF, and CC methods with an application to anharmonic phonon dispersion in a one-dimensional crystal. The formalisms and computer programs for these methods were generated by a symbolic algebra code, a forward-looking strategy subsequently adopted by many. We propose a high-risk-high-return research project that integrates these two domains––electrons and vibrations––capitalizing on the aforementioned developments supported by DOE. We will establish a hierarchy of diagrammatic ab initio coupled electron-vibrational theories that treat small molecules and infinite solids on an equal footing, taking into account electron correlation, anharmonicity, and vibronic coupling in a uniform mathematical framework. With the recognition that three widely used [crude adiabatic (CA), Born–Oppenheimer (BO), and Born–Huang (BH)] formulations of vibronic coupling are all ill-suited for perturbation theory, we will adopt Geilikman’s approach that mixes the CA and BO formalisms in order to build diagrammatic MP and GF theories for coupled electron-vibration problems. We will first develop ab initio vibronic full configuration interaction (FCI) theory and program for electrons and anharmonic vibrations coupled by Geilikman vibronic interactions at zero and nonzero temperatures. Using this as a numerical benchmark, we will construct diagrammatic MP and GF theories both algebraically (by differentiation of the vibronic FCI formulas) and diagrammatically, verifying each other. We will also formulate vibronic CC theory as the Fröhlich canonical transformation of Geilikman vibronic interactions. The successful outcome of this project is a major advance for theoretical physics in the area of quantum many-body theory and the corresponding software for accurate computational solutions to coupled electron-vibrational problems molecules and solids such as superconductivity."

This new area of basic research, has emerged as an important focus area in Condensed Matter Physics. It also drives many important technologies which have given prominence to the US as a technological power house. Invariably this relies on the development of novel, functional materials in unusual configurations which are structured at the nanoscale. Recent developments in synthesis, characterization, nanostructuring, and measurement techniques open up the possibility for the study and engineering of quantum materials and devices which were not possible earlier. When pushing such limits invariably new physics is uncovered and new technologies emerge. Historically this approach, funded by DOE and some done in the PI’s labs, has already led to major technological revolutions in the magnetic storage industry and is providing the foundational science for the field of Spintronics. It should be noted that this multibillion dollar industry has evolved precisely from the type of basic research described here. This project is precisely in the center of this world wide activity and will lead to interesting functional devices which use quantum materials in unusual configurations. The general type of science to be pursued here relies on a variety of proximity effects in quantum magnetic hybrids, and induced phenomena by the application of external driving forces such as time varying electromagnetic fields, light and other types of radiation. There are two novel aspects of this work: 1) the reduction of complex quantum materials to the nanoscale, where fundamental changes may occur in their physical properties and 2) application of time varying stimuli. This moves the basic science in the realm of length and time scales not yet investigated. The novel ideas presented are universal and have not been addressed before. At the same time they are grounded on real materials. From the applied point of view, technological developments will require these materials and devices to be reduced to ever smaller sizes and used at ever faster time scales. This project focuses in the following two directions: 1) The properties of confined materials to short length scales in all three dimensions produce an opportunity and a challenge. Confinement opens up new coupling mechanism in nanostructured materials. At the same time, this is complicated by the inevitable disorder present at short length scales which may affect the properties of materials in an essential way. Untangling these effects and understanding their behavior at the nanoscale is a major challenge which is undertaken in this project. At this length scales, devices are used in regimes in which, even for modest operational conditions, the fields applied to the material become very large so understanding their behavior under strong driving is essential. 2) At fast time scales a similar situation arises. The steady state behavior provides a snap-shot of the physics averaged over many interesting and potentially useful shorter time behaviors to be addressed here. The experimental research advocated here, overlaps directly with the regimes in which theoretical/computational approaches can be made. None of this was possible until recently and therefore this research opens up a new area for the future. The research described above will surely generate new, yet unexplored science and will eventually lead to transformative technology such as energy storage, sensors, electronics and data storage. In particular, this may have direct relevance to the future development of magnetic materials for energy transformation (transformers) or modern electronics (reconfigurable circuits, fault tolerant computing, self-repairing electronic systems, and molecular spintronics)."

This generates wealth for all of society in the form of increasing industrial competitiveness, with approaches that require less cost, are more energy efficient, and have less environmental impact (greener). A promising approach to this overarching goal identified by the pioneering and visionary 2017 Basic Energy Sciences Workshop Report entitled ""Basic Research Needs in Catalysis Science"" is the idea of designing catalysts beyond the binding site, inspired by the way that nature performs catalysis in enzymes. This approach includes the idea of fully leveraging the effect of the environment surrounding the active site, for maximum catalytic benefit in terms of activity and selectivity. In this research project, we build on the Katz research group's recent discovery of how partial confinement at the active site, in the form of an environment provided by hemispherical 1.4 nm-diameter cavities on the external surface of a zeotype (the first example of catalysts employing grafted complexes on the external surface of a zeotype), can enhance catalysis above and beyond what is possible with a disordered (amorphous) support. The proposal consists of a rigorous experimental program aimed to investigate the fundamental nature of the more favorable entropic barriers associated with these partially confined environments. By taking these additional steps to emulate the proficiency of nature's catalysts, new approaches to enhance catalysis on solid surfaces will emerge through this program. The ramifications and impact of this understanding are broad in terms of reaction classes, and include reactions and chemical products in varied industries, including the petrochemical space, because of the broad applicability of the mechanical constructs used for enhancing catalysis with these approaches."

The main theme of this proposal is to do just that, which is to catalytically activate, both selectively and under mild conditions, this parent hydrocarbon, and with zero emissions. The reaction we will investigate will involve replacing one C-H bond of methane or ethane (the two main components of natural gas) with a boryl fragment, in order to render it a more value-added reagent in chemical synthesis and applications. We will first explore well-defined catalysts for CH4 borylation using iridium and osmium, and then expand this methodology to a cheaper and earth abundant metal such as iron. Some of these precursors will be grafted onto oxide surfaces and further exploited for the catalytic borylation of natural gas. Our proposal plans to develop novel but simple to prepare metal complexes as catalysts for the borylation of these hydrocarbons, and explore tandem catalysis in order to better use the borane by-product inasmuch as maximize the atom-economical process associated with borylation. In order to block decomposition pathways and make these catalysts recyclable, we will immobilize these onto oxide supports and characterize these systems with a battery of spectroscopic and analytical techniques. These solid-supported catalysts will be then tested for the catalytic borylation of volatile hydrocarbons using high-throughput and high-pressure methods in addition to computational guided analysis of the reaction pathway. The latter will aid us in the optimization of reaction conditions and extend this borylation approach to a base metal such as iron."

Computational science and engineering (CSE) is a multidisciplinary approach that leverages scientific computing to develop practical problem-solving methods and to supply technical tools across the scientific discovery spectrum. The Program has a particular emphasis on HPC-enabled CSE that advances science and engineering in directions important to the US Department of Energy and to the US economy in general. Over the past half-century, HPC has been an essential tool for DOE’s success. Indeed, during this period, important missions, such as nuclear stockpile stewardship, have turned to HPC as an essential technology. Entire science disciplines, such as biology and cosmology, have been transformed through the augmentation of scientific observation via HPC. At government laboratories and in industry, Program alumni are helping push traditional HPC boundaries while contributing to discoveries in additive manufacturing, nanomaterials for next-generation batteries and transistors, and turbine and advanced nuclear reactor design. In addition, HPC is used to address national health needs that will eventually point to cures both by helping cancer researchers manage and analyze huge troves of data and by simulating biological mechanisms and accelerating drug development — including continuing to rise to the challenge of COVID-19 through a national HPC consortium anchored by DOE. An explosion in scientific and technological data has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated HPC to transform those data into scientific understanding. With access to more and more data and the proliferation of HPC, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are experiencing a renaissance, complementing the now well-established use of computational simulation. Indeed, in its September 2020 subcommittee report on “AI/ML, Data Intensive Science and High-Performance Computing”, the DOE Advanced Scientific Computing Advisory Committee (ASCAC) explicitly calls out the need for a fellowship program to train computational and data scientists to tackle exascale and data-intensive computing challenges. This collaboration of empirical and theory-based modeling will increasingly inform federal policymakers whose decisions affect American society and future generations. Mirroring this transformative change to computationally enabled science and technology has been a serious need for highly skilled and intellectually agile computational scientists who can support the fast-moving research environment at the DOE National Laboratories and in the national scientific community. In fact, the DOE CSGF program explicitly addresses this need. Financial support is provided through a grant which covers all expenses incurred by Krell Institute and it is anticipated funding from the grant will go directly to the Laboratories for the PIs who reside there."

This phenomenon could be harnessed to improve the outcome of traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. The objective of this research is to determine network, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that affect neuronal recovery from injury to help improve therapeutic strategies for treatment of neuronal injury. The NJIT and PCRF research team will determine the effects of cold atmospheric plasma on neural regeneration in live organism such as nematode and investigate possible mechanism of action. The rationale is that by regulating the operation parameters of devices that generate plasma in room temperature and atmospheric pressure, it is possible to find the therapeutic window between neuronal regeneration and harm. The system of laser microsurgery will allow a precise, repeatable injury to an axon or dendrite of neurons with no collateral damage in a live organism and application of plasma reproducible in energy, time, and space. The project will aim to characterize the plasma properties needed for regeneration by two innovative plasma producing devices, assess the efficacy of the treatment, the induced physiological levels of radical species, and test the interaction with candidate genes. When completed, the study will have both basic science and therapeutic impacts. By testing the effect on neuronal regeneration and its mechanism of action, the study will contribute to the fundamental understanding bioactive properties of plasma in live organisms. By characterizing the novel design of the plasma generating devices, the study will expand the therapeutic potential of plasma.

The objective of this project is to utilize first-principles computational approaches to understand optical excitations within low-dimensional materials, with the goal of designing new materials by modifying the chemical and physical structure on the nanoscale. Controlling the nature and migration properties of excitons is a challenge because of the complex relationship between electrons, atomic vibrations (phonons), spins, defects, disorder, and dynamics. By analysis of highly accurate quantum mechanics-based calculations, we will determine how to decompose these complexities into simple, physically intuitive models. We will study the optical properties of three classes of low-dimensional materials: We will (1) elucidate the role of atomic vibration on the nature of excitons in magnetic layered materials; (2) build a model of exciton decoherence in defective single-walled carbon nanotubes; and (3) develop a simple model of stacked two-dimensional materials, including interlayer Raman-active phonons, to provide simple tuning parameters for modification of excitonic properties. These studies will enable the formation of physically motivated design rules for new organic and inorganic nanostructures. The proposed studies include large-scale calculations that will effectively utilize DOE high performance computing centers.

Quantum Transduction with Abundant Elements for Cleaner Energy,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023393,"Flatte, Michael",Michael.Flatte@universityofiowa,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","QUANTUM TRANSDUCTION WITH ABUNDANT ELEMENTS FOR CLEANER ENERGY M. E. Flatté, University of Iowa (Principal Investigator) D. R. Candido, University of Iowa (Co-Investigator) D. Paudyal, Ames National Laboratory (Laboratory Collaborator) Quantum transduction is an essential step in quantum information processing. One example of quantum transduction is the conversion of quantum information from microwave to optical quanta, which allows quantum information produced by quantum computers to be communicated long distances with low loss. Communication of quantum information is typically conducted by encoding it in some aspect of an elementary excitation of the electromagnetic field (a photon) at optical frequencies (~ 200 THz). Quantum computers, however, usually process quantum information encoded in microwave photons at frequencies of a few GHz, i.e. more than 10,000 times smaller in frequency and energy. Quantum transduction requires high-fidelity operations enabled by some medium that has nonlinear optical properties. Current leaders in microwave to optical quantum transduction are electro-optic approaches, using nonlinear materials whose optical properties respond to electric fields such as lithium niobate, and rare-earth-ion-spin approaches, using materials with optical transitions whose absorption or emission depend on the magnetic orientation of electrons in the core of a defect. For rare-earth-ion-spin approaches the microwave excitation reorients the spin, changing the optical properties, providing a mechanism to convert microwave excitations to optical ones. An example system for such a rare-earth-ion-spin approach is erbium ions doped into the transparent material yttrium orthovanadate. The main challenges with rare-earth-ion-spin quantum transduction are the coupling strength between microwave and optical excitations, the optical loss due to impurities in the material, and the cost or accessibility of the required materials. For cost and accessibility (critical materials concerns) it is yttrium that is the principal concern as erbium is used in very small quantities (parts per million) by comparison. This project is a collaboration involving the University of Iowa and Ames National Laboratory to investigate the properties of materials with abundant rare-earth elements such as cerium orthovanadate and cerium orthophosphate, where cerium is replacing the yttrium in more typically explored materials. The team will calculate the ground-state magnetism, low-temperature microwave response of the magnetic system, magnetic excitations and optical properties. The hypotheses are that these calculations and advances in theories simulating these materials will identify rare-earth materials with abundant elements that provide comparable or superior fidelity and efficiency of microwave to optical quantum transduction in addition to comparable or superior quantum memory density with comparable (or longer) memory times to current materials containing rare elements such as yttrium. The University of Iowa, in collaboration with Ames National Laboratory, will refine and employ first-principles theory to assess the utility of these materials. Electronic structure and atomistic models will be developed, with improved descriptions of fundamental interactions of the ion with the solid-state host. Codes developed at the University of Iowa will be used to (1) investigate longer-range exchange interactions between rare earth spins, (2) clarify the coupling of microwaves to those spins, (3) explore the coupling of optical fields to different orbital states, and (4) mitigate the effect of defects that might otherwise diminish the fidelity and efficiency of transduction. This project will establish a fundamental understanding of rare-earth hosts with abundant elements (with cerium replacing rare elements) for quantum information science, and identify whether the current advances in rare earth solids for quantum information science can be translated to specific hosts consisting entirely of abundant elements. This will provide clear targets for clean-energy rare-earth quantum information materials. In addition to advancing the understanding of cerium-based hosts, this project will improve the theoretical understanding of rare earth solids in general and assist in translating novel rare earth materials physics to real-world quantum information science applications for quantum transduction and memories."

Recent advances in organic synthesis have opened the materials field to this new family of polymers which are seen as –SO2– equivalents of the carbonyl-containing high-commodity polymers, polyureas and polyurethanes, respectively. Preliminary results reveal that polysulfamides exhibit superior physical properties including high decomposition temperatures and tunable glass transition temperatures. Further, they can be depolymerized back to monomers simply by heating in aqueous acids making them inherently amenable to chemical recycling. These exciting initial findings suggest that polysulfamides and polysulfamates have the potential to outcompete commercially available plastics. However, for these new classes of polymers to ultimately replace polyureas and polyurethanes, there is a need for a fundamental understanding of their structural, thermal, and mechanical properties as well as the underlying molecular interactions that drive them.

This will require development of novel optical probes, novel detectors, and dedicated optical imaging modalities. Quantum-enabled technologies could provide advantages over classical tools and hence are the topic of this project. We will take a multi-pronged approach to quantum-enabled MP imaging. We will develop non-invasive methods to visualize MP changes from the nanometer level to individual bacterial cells up to whole microbial communities and study their modes of bioelectrical communications. We will use quantum-enabled voltage sensitive probes, novel single-photon counting detectors, and novel imaging modalities that utilize both classical and non-classical. We will compare and contrast the performances of these modalities, and explore their ‘quantum advantage’ for MP imaging. The objectives of our project are: (1) Development of optical probes: We will develop, optimize, and compare quantum dots and lifetime-based voltage sensing dyes (2) Development of advanced detectors: We will develop time-gated single-photon avalanche diode array imagers and time-correlated single-photon counting avalanche diode arrays (3) Development of classical light lifetime-based MP imaging: We will develop fluorescence lifetime-based MP imaging using the detectors developed in (2).

Plant biomass is made of several different types of cells. Each one of these types has different physical and chemical characteristics and functions. Thus, understanding how genes determine if a given cell will become of a given type allows us to determine how a cell’s identity and properties are controlled. While we and others have uncovered the role of genes that control the development of cells in plant biomass, these studies have been generally limited to a few of these genes. Uncovering the function of all the genes involved in the development of cell types that compose plant biomass creates the opportunity to manipulate this biomass composition, making it more suitable to produce energy. In this project, we propose to apply single-cell transcriptomics to the analysis of Populus and Sorghum stems to identify the genes involved in determining the cellular composition of plant biomass. We previously developed the method of single-cell transcriptomics to characterize all genes expressed in individual cells, as they differentiate from meristematic cells to each of the fully developed cells that are part of plant biomass. Here we will apply these approaches to analyze the development of biomass from the bioenergy crops Populus and Sorghum. Our specific objectives are to (1) define the function of each gene during the development of the main cell types that determine Populus and Sorghum biomass and their cell-wall composition; (2) understand how cells evolve from one type to another, by identifying which genes control that process; and (3) validate their function to confirm their role in biomass development and their potential for enhancing biomass yield and properties. Achieving these objectives will provide new routes to modify biomass properties in Populus and Sorghum and, consequently, the value of their biomass for bioenergy production."

For example, the quantum anomalous Hall effect has been demonstrated in magnetic topological insulators, which offers the potential for tunable transport through dissipationless states that are of interest for on-chip interconnects, new metrology standards, or efficient spintronics memory devices. Layered materials are uniquely well suited toward this end as magnetic and electronic properties can be intertwined in these materials, leading to tunable magneto-electric effects via new terms in Maxwell equations for the material response. The PIs’ approach starts with two classes of layered topological materials: one with magnetic moments added to the surface, and one with magnetic planes integrated into the layered structure itself. The added susceptibility of topological states in these materials to the real-space structure of the physical specimen places a priority on sample growth and surface preparation in ultrahigh vacuum, and importantly, on in situ characterization with surface-, spin- and momentum-resolved probes. Atomistic theory will be used in the interpretation of the measured electronic density of states, and comparison with spin transport theory provides new methods for quantifying the magnetic interactions with the topological states.

Detection and subsequent response to faults and failures caused by natural events, component degradation, and cyber-attacks is critical. The sheer magnitude of this sprawling system is of particular concern, with millions of potential cyber-intrusion access points in hardware, software, and network connections. Effective monitoring systems must do more than rely on simple logical protocols. The overall goal of this research is to investigate efficient, adaptable neuromorphic computing solutions to increase resilience of the power grid under natural and adversarial failure conditions. To achieve this goal, the project addresses several objectives: (1) Deploying grid models onto real-time simulators with failure and attack scenarios; (2) Implementing spike representation encoding of system parameters; (3) Designing and optimizing spiking neuromorphic architectures; (4) Benchmarking performance of the neuromorphic approach using multiple criteria. Power grid operation will be simulated in real-time, for which system parameters and state variables will be streamed through a neuromorphic spiking neural network (SNN) platform. The SNN will interface with the system via standard protocols, encode the data in spike representations, and process these event-based spatiotemporal patterns (STPs) to detect correlations and anomalies. Real-time response will be provided through a separate response SNN. Modeling and simulation will also guide neuromorphic SNN architecture development, paired with hardware validation and testing. SNNs have been selected for the neuromorphic platform due to their ability to handle streaming information from a large number of input sources. SNNs are able to employ a wide variety of training algorithms on the global and local levels, and this effort will focus on evolutionary optimization (a genetic algorithm) paired with Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning localized at the synapses. The STPs on which SNNs operate provide very rich, high-dimensional representations of information. Combining these methods holds particular promise for extremely accurate and rapid detection of abnormal operating conditions in a broad range of distributed systems including the power grid. Outcomes of the research are also applicable to many industrial settings utilizing a variety of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and to edge computing and other complex distributed networks for which reliability and resilience are of concern.

Two issues with which models have struggled will be examined in order to provide potential improvements particularly for projections of the future climate. The first is the basic global temperature reaction to increasing GHGs often defined as the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) or a related metric, the transient climate response (TCR). Empirical evidence suggests the climate system shows lower sensitivity than models indicate, sometimes much lower. However, direct calculations of ECS and TCR, which then are used to identify the direct impact of GHGs alone, is degraded due issues such as (a) the unknown influence of natural variations, (c) the relatively short time-scale of good observations, and (c) the uncertainty in the actual forcing of the GHGs themselves. We will examine “Fast-Feedback Processes” which are not confounded by the difficulties just mentioned, so that a clearer relationship between a generic forcing and the associated response will be possible. Two key variables we shall use are the tropospheric temperature and the heat flux leaving the planet because the heat that escapes to space (part of the sensitivity calculation) originates mostly from the troposphere, not the surface, hence the two metrics are directly connected. We shall then relate these shorter-term metrics to ECS and TCR to better understand the magnitude of the longer-term climate response to perturbations in forcing. The second issue is known as Arctic Amplification (AA) in which the Arctic air temperatures are anticipated to warm faster than the globe as a whole. Models have consistently underestimated AA compared with observations. Our approach is to examine stable boundary layer (SBL) processes which are only crudely depicted in climate models. Using a high-resolution model of the Arctic we shall be able to analyze the fluxes of energy in the SBL that are highly non-linear and dependent on subtle changes that impact the rate at which heat is mixed from the deeper atmosphere above to the cold surface layer. The roles of aerosols, GHGs and surface roughness will be important as their presence can disrupt the delicate formation of the very cold surface layer, leading to higher surface temperatures through greater vertical mixing which we hypothesize is the reason for the observed extra warming at the surface. These stability characteristics are only very crudely mimicked in climate models and we shall determine to what extent a better representation of the SBL might lead to a better match with the temperature changes observed."

Brock, Wayne State University (Principal Investigator) Zhenfei Liu, Wayne State University (Co-Investigator) Jier Huang, Marquette University (Co-Investigator) Efficient and cost-effective solar-driven photocatalysis is of considerable interest because the direct conversion of solar energy to fuels enables clean, renewable energy that is truly distributed, bypassing the need for an integrated system of photovoltaics coupled to electrolyzers or batteries, and associated energy conversion losses. The key challenge to this endeavor is to develop a photocatalytic architecture that is capable of integrating multiple essential components (e.g., photosensitizer, charge transport mediator, catalyst, etc.) that are needed to drive the complex series of events required for efficient photocatalysis. This proposal aims to address this challenge, focusing on overall water splitting, by integrating quantum dots (QDs) with different functionalities into a 3-D macroscopic architecture (a gel) capable of regulating the flow of energy and carriers while preserving access to the active surface of the constituent nanoparticles via an inter-connected pore network. The primary focus of this application is to establish the relationship between the properties of individual QDs/catalyst moieties and their integrated composites, with a specific emphasis on how geometry, domain size, and interfacial linkers dictate exciton formation/delocalization, charge separation, charge transport, charge transfer, and catalysis within the ensemble. This understanding will be pursued through a complementary experimental-computational approach focusing initially on CdS and ZnSe QDs because their quantum-confined energy profiles are suitable for visible light absorption, water reduction, and water oxidation, and when combined, they exhibit a Type II band alignment, favoring charge separation. The following project objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Elucidate the native characteristics of single-component CdS and ZnSe QD gels linked by di- or polychalcogenide linkers relative to discrete QDs via computational modeling and interrogation of photophysical and transport properties correlated to photocatalytic water reduction. Objective 2: Unveil the photocatalytic and photophysical properties of co-gels comprising CdS (photosensitizer, electron transport network) and ZnSe (hole transport network) as a function of chalcogenide linker and degree of component mixing, aided by computational modeling. Objective 3: Establish the effect of water reduction (Pt) and water oxidation (IrO2) catalyst introduction to the CdS-ZnSe gel network as a function of the catalyst electronic structure, size, loading, and environment, on the photophysical characteristics of the assemblies and the photocatalytic water splitting efficiency. Combine with the developing computational model to develop a set of design rules that enable formation of integrated multicomponent systems in which complex phenomena are orchestrated to facilitate conversion of light to solar fuels. These objectives will be accomplished by the joint efforts of the three PIs who combine their complementary expertise in materials design, theory, and photophysical measurements to address important knowledge gaps that limit our ability to regulate interactions in integrated multicomponent systems for efficient overall water splitting. Methods to be used include solution-phase QD assembly/photodeposition, diagnostic photocatalytic water splitting studies, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, and static and dynamic time-resolved spectroscopies. The expected impact of our work lies in the insight that will be gained into the fundamental differences between QD gels and discrete QDs, which will lead to quantitative structure-property relationships that will facilitate the rational design of efficient and robust photocatalytic systems that are essential for sustainable solar fuels development. Moreover, the proposed material design strategy and the fundamental principles elucidated will result in a structural model that can be employed for future development of other photoactive materials, thus broadly impacting solar energy conversion fields including photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and light emitting devices."

This multiscale framework will enable simulations of the real-time dynamics of nonequilibrium excited state proton-coupled electron transfer, quantum decoherence, vibronic energy transfer, and ultrafast radiolysis, as well as their associated time-resolved multidimensional spectroscopies. The first goal is to develop the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) time-dependent complete active space approach, in which specified nuclei, typically protons, are treated quantum mechanically on the same level as the electrons. Propagation of a time-dependent, multireference nuclear-electronic wavefunction will allow the calculation of vibrational, electronic, and vibronic spectra as well as nuclear-electronic dynamics. The second goal is to couple this time-dependent NEO approach with chemical environments modeled with a time-dependent polarizable continuum or molecular mechanics, thereby describing the time-evolving mutual polarization between the NEO quantum system and its environment. The third goal is to develop the framework to perform nonadiabatic surface hopping dynamics on the NEO vibronic surfaces. The combination of these methods will enable multiscale simulations of nuclear-electronic quantum dynamics beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in complex environments. These methods will be used to probe the fundamental physical principles underlying proton transfer events in water radiolysis and excited state energy and proton transfer in photochemical processes. These computational approaches will be validated by comparison to multidimensional spectroscopic experiments. The educational effort will be aimed at broadening participation in computational chemical sciences by increasing the diversity of the scientific computing workforce. The specific goal is to recruit Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students from the University of Hawai?i to participate in a summer research program at the University of Washington through a synergistic partnership between three institutions. An important outcome of this project will be a sustainable, reusable, and interoperable NEO-based open-source software ecosystem. A research community will be built around this software to ensure that the future development is community driven and sustainable.

Specifically, the principal investigators (PIs) of this project have documented (1) statistically significant changes in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) region and its air-sea coupling dynamics, and (2) the dynamics of two-way tropical-extratropical coupling between the North Pacific and Central Tropical Pacific (NP-CP), which involve the extratropical precursor dynamics of El Niño.

This project will develop new understanding and novel approaches aimed at diagnosing and comparing the dynamical processes of PDV in ESMs, going beyond the analysis of the dominant variance patterns, and will also expand our ability to implement performance evaluation metrics that better capture key processes of ESM behavior. Approach & Hypothesis: By combining existing re-analysis products and climate model ensembles of Earth System Models with empirical dynamical models (EDMs) and high-resolution simulations of the E3SM, this proposal will examine the following hypothesis. Hypothesis-1: The KOE global teleconnections to PDV and the dynamics of two-way coupling between tropics and extratropics energize two dominant Pacific “dynamical” modes, the KOE Mode and the NP-CP Mode, which are changing under anthropogenic forcing (addressed in TASK 1: Diagnose “dynamical” modes of variability in a changing climate using EDMs). Hypothesis-2: The KOE air-sea interactions and resulting large-scale teleconnections are critical for the KOE and NP-CP mode. Increasing the resolution of climate models used in CMIP projections over the KOE region is necessary to improve the representation and predictability of North Pacific climate modes and extremes (addressed in TASK 2: Assess the effects of KOE air-sea interactions in the representation of PDV in ESMs and high-resolution simulations of E3SM). Hypothesis-3: The dynamics and changes in the NP-CP mode have led to the observed positive trend in climate variance in the Northeast Pacific and Central Tropical Pacific SSTs, which is linked to the recent marine heatwaves and precipitation extremes over North America (addressed in TASK 3: Using EDM dynamic filtering on observations and ESMs simulations to diagnose the impacts of the NP-CP mode on climate extremes). Science Team: The PIs bring complementary expertise in the theory and EDM diagnostic modeling of Pacific climate variability (Di Lorenzo, Capotondi), ENSO dynamics (Capotondi, Stevenson), E3SM modeling (Stevenson), and coupled climate modeling with ESMs (Stevenson, Di Lorenzo and Capotondi). The PIs will also collaborate with Luke Van Roekel, an E3SM developer at Los Alamos National Laboratory, to conduct the E3SM high-resolution sensitivity simulations. Dr. Matthew Newman (UC Boulder) and Dr. Dillon Amaya (NOAA) will also collaborate on the climate extremes diagnostic for the EDM, E3SM, and ESMs simulations. Broader Implications: The PDV and climate change control both large-amplitude transitions in marine ecosystems and the statistics of climate and weather extremes in the Pacific basin. More recently, the interactions between PDV and climate change have been implicated in the dynamics and evolutions of prolonged extreme conditions over North America, yet the mechanisms controlling the PDV phase and predictability remain unclear because of the wide range of model-dependent expressions that have not been diagnosed from a mechanistic point of view in ESMs. This proposal will provide the basis for a dynamical interpretation of the differences in the current suite of coupled climate models and associated representation errors. The improved understanding and modeling of the dynamics of PDV will provide a mechanistic-based framework for predicting societally relevant indicators linked to droughts, heatwaves, and ecosystem services. All tools and diagnostics developed in this project will become available to the ESM community."

The field of ionic separations spans a wide range of applications such as the removal of contaminants in ground water treatment, nutrient recovery from wastewater, rare earth metal extraction, and metal recovery from mining effluents. These applications are relevant to the energy storage and power generation sectors, as well as securing supply chains for critical materials that are vital to the U.S. economy (e.g., electronics sector). A major challenge in separations using electrochemical methods is to be able to target specific ions and remove them selectively from mixtures while keeping the energy use low. The molecular-level properties of materials play a central role in selective separations; however, the relationship between molecular design and interactions to ionic separations under different external stimuli, such as electric fields, is complex and all relationships between the interactions across various spatiotemporal scales is often unknown. This project employs a data science driven approach, based on machine learning, to predict polymeric ion-exchange materials properties that govern selective and high-flux ionic separations. Machine learning is an effective tool that identifies data trends that are not so obvious and offers future predictions for improving materials and separation platform efficiency without a priori knowledge of the relationships in the system under study. Notably, this project examines water-splitting in bipolar junctions for exploiting pH modulation for selective ionic separations. Ion partitioning and transport through ionomer materials are also examined in the context of selective separations. Molecular simulations are incorporated into a machine learning framework that leverages surrogate models and transfer learning to yield accurate simulations and to rationally guide the next generation of materials for ionic separations."

Anderson, University of Wisconsin-Madison (Principal Investigator) Dr. William Capecchi, University of Wisconsin-Madison (Co-Investigator) The LTX-b program is a key contributor to worldwide spherical tokamak research. It is unique in a fusion research point of view as the only device with a full liquid lithium wall. Liquid metal plasma-facing surfaces are perhaps the best alternative to tungsten plasma facing components. While liquid metals will undergo erosion and redeposition just like their solid counterparts, there is no attendant modification of mechanical or thermal properties. Helium retention does not pose an issue to a liquid wall (immune to welling), nor does neutron embrittlement; recirculation continually re-forms the wall. In a more general scientific context, LTX-b operates in a regime of much lower collisionality than other machines of its size. Combined with the small physical size and mature diagnostic set, it is an ideal candidate for full-device modeling. It allows exploring a new region in parameter space defined by the low-recycling boundary of the liquid lithium, and can aid in development of predictive capability in fusion science. Previous research on LTX has proven the benefit of the low recycling wall by achieving a flat electron temperature profile as a consequence of the boundary condition, not due to transport, and leads to a high temperature at the boundary. The current approach to plasma-material interactions is to strongly cool the plasma edge by recycling, gas injection and radiation. This ensures edge particle energies are below the sputtering threshold of the heavy solid first wall material, but negatively impacts plasma performance. The low recycling walls in LTX-b result in a very hot, low-density edge with particle energies above the sputtering peak. This regime is consistent and compatible only with liquid lithium plasma facing components. No damage occurs to the wall and the hot edge enables access to enhanced fusion performance regimes. Highest impact research in the spherical tokamak (ST) geometry will address scientific issues on topics including plasma-boundary interface, energetic particles and wave-particle interactions, and transport physics. Auxiliary heating will enable research on these fronts and is a necessity for probing transport physics in the flat-temperature regime created by the low-recycling boundary. LTX-b is the only machine in the world that can perform these studies. This proposal is to collaboratively support the auxiliary heating effort using Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) and to study that fast ion physics that it enables. NBI is predicted to more than double the plasma temperature, and additionally is a source of highly energetic ions within the plasma. Transport properties are uncovered by combining thermal measurements with advanced modeling. The addition of a neutral particle analyzer (NPA) adds important information on the ion distribution, and can measure energetic particle driven instabilities and non-classical transport. Anticipated Major Outcomes: (1) Leverage considerable experience of UW-Madison technical staff to optimize heating beam performance. (2) Play integral role in conducting NBI heating experiments and data analysis (3) Perform advanced modeling, including TRANSP/NUBEAM of fast ion deposition and full orbit particle following, to support experimental measurements. (4) Commission a NPA for diagnosing fast ion physics and NBI impact on bulk hydrogen distribution. (5) Investigate fast ion confinement and Alfvenic instabilities in LTX-b including fast ion losses to a liquid lithium wall."
Solar Energy Conversion in Photosystem I Studied Using Time-Resolved Visible and Infrared Difference Spectroscopy,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0017937,"Hastings, Gary","Gary.Hastings@georgiastateuniversityresearchfoundation,inc.","['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","In photosystem I, solar energy capture results in the transfer of electrons via a series of protein-bound pigments across a biological membrane. Electron transfer in photosystem I is highly efficient. This efficiency arises because the pigments involved in electron transfer have gained some unique properties. These unique properties result from a variety of pigment-protein interactions. A phylloquinone molecule (also known as vitamin K1) functions as an intermediary in electron transfer of photosystem I, occupying the so-called A1 protein binding site. It is a particularly interesting species because it is one of the most reducing quinones in all of biology. The molecular mechanisms (pigment-protein interactions) that allow phylloquinone in photosystem I to function at such an extreme are poorly understood. Foreign quinones can also be incorporated into the A1 binding site in photosystem I, and these incorporated quinones also function at an extreme. The goal of this project is to gain a molecular-level understanding of the factors that modulate the functional properties of quinones that occupy the A1 binding site in photosystem I. There are three distinct aspects to the experimental work that will be undertaken: 1. Native and modified photosystem I samples will be prepared. Photosystem I will be modified either by incorporating different quinones into the A1 binding site, or by using site directed mutagenesis to disrupt specific pigment-protein interactions. 2. Time-resolved spectroscopy in the visible spectral region will be used to gain information on the functional properties of native and modified photosystem I samples, at 298 and 77 K. Electron transfer reactions in photosystem I occur on timescales from femtoseconds to seconds. We will therefore employ multiple different time-resolved spectrometers that allow us to study electron transfer in photosystem I with time resolutions from femtoseconds to seconds. 3. Time-resolved infrared difference spectroscopy will be used to probe the molecular details of electron transfer in native and modified photosystem I samples, at 298 and 77 K. Infrared difference spectroscopy is molecular-specific, and with time resolution the overall functional properties of the incorporated quinones can be assessed. Nanosecond and microsecond time-resolved infrared difference spectroscopy will be used to study photosystem I at 298 and 77 K, respectively. Previously, only work at 77 K had been undertaken. For studies of photosystem I under physiological conditions (at room temperature (~298 K)) two different laser-based time-resolved infrared spectrometers will be used. Previously we have developed and used two distinctly different computational methods to assess and analyze the data that is obtained. First, a kinetic modeling approach was developed, and this will be extended and used to relate the bioenergetics of electron transfer to important functional properties (such as redox potentials) of the quinones in the protein binding site. Second, a density functional theory based QM:MM method aimed at simulating the time-resolved infrared difference spectra was developed. This approach will also be extended and used to assess the spectra that will be obtained. The molecular models constructed for this QM:MM computational approach will also be used to simulate and interpret electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic data that has been obtained."

In particular, the discovery that titanium oxide (TiO2) photocatalyzes the dissociation of water has triggered broad interest and intensive studies of water adsorption on TiO2 over decades. However, there is still limited information on the interfaces of TiO2 with liquid water and aqueous solutions, which are the relevant systems in most practical applications. The main goal of this project is to obtain a comprehensive picture of the surfaces and aqueous interfaces of TiO2 through first principles-based simulations, as this understanding can also help improve the ability to control their properties and those of other oxide interfaces as well. Specific systems/processes to be investigated in this renewal project include: the aqueous interface of amorphous TiO2, a widely used coating material in biomedical engineering and electrochemistry; carboxylic acid adsorption on TiO2 surfaces from dilute solution, one of the most common processes used for the functionalization of TiO2 and other metal oxide surfaces; the hydration structure of iridium oxide, which is widely considered as the current state-of-the-art anode material for the oxygen evolution reaction; and electron transfer across the aqueous interfaces of wide band gap oxides, a process affecting the production of H2 in water radiolysis. Our approach is based on quantum mechanical simulations combined with enhanced sampling and machine learning techniques, which allow us to model systems and phenomena spanning a wide range of size and time scales through accurate yet computationally efficient interatomic potentials based on deep neural networks."

This project aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the factors that dictate activity and selectivity during electrochemical partial oxidation of multi-carbon organic molecules derived from biomass. Selective conversions of alcohols to aldehydes, and aldehydes to carboxylic acids will be considered. More specifically we will develop principles for the rational design of catalysts that promote acidic partial oxidations of furfural and 5-hydoxymethyfurfural. These represent biomass-derived platform chemicals for an array of value-added products and serve as proxies for oxidation of alcohol and aldehyde functional groups in general. The basic goal is to understand the requirements for controlling the oxidative progression of the oxygenate functional groups (aldehyde to acid, alcohol to aldehyde vs. acid) while also avoiding undesired pathways that lead to poisoning species—for example, C-C cleavage steps that lead to adsorbed CO or overoxidation of acids to adsorbed carboxylates (R-COO). Work will center around investigation of three possible mechanisms that can break scaling relations between the adsorption energies of key intermediates and rate determining transition states. These include (i) formation of alloy catalysts that violate common correlations between adsorption energies and the d-electron energy center of the constituent metals; (ii) formation of catalyst heterostructures that interface metals and metal-oxides that obey different scaling relations; and (iii) modification of electrolyte composition with anions that can adsorb to catalysts and selectively influence particular adsorbate interactions. The investigations will involve well- defined material synthesis, comparative kinetics, and in-situ and operando spectroscopies, supported by quantum chemical simulations. Applying these tools to a systematic sampling of materials and operating conditions, mechanistic hypotheses will be tested, and tunable materials design strategies as well as reaction engineering approaches will be developed to circumvent apparent limitations. The ultimate goal is to enable design of viable catalytic systems for a wide range of organic electro-oxidation reactions."
"The mechanisms, impacts and predictability of extreme El Nino events in E3SM and other Earth system models: quantifying the role of westerly wind bursts",Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023134,"Fedorov, Alexey",Alexey.Fedorov@yaleuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","The mechanisms, impacts, and predictability of extreme El Niño events in E3SM and other Earth system models: quantifying the role of westerly wind bursts Alexey Fedorov, Yale University (Lead Investigator) Eli Tziperman, Harvard University (Co-Investigator) El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of inter-annual climate variability. This climate mode is excited by ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific but its global teleconnections extend far beyond the tropics. Yet, it is extreme El Niño events that have the largest impacts on global climate and weather patterns, ecosystems, and human health. Three such extreme El Niño have occurred in recent decades (1982, 1997, and 2015), leading to billions of dollars in damages worldwide. Several other El Niño events in the observational record were only slightly weaker. With rising temperatures, should we expect more frequent and/or even stronger extreme El Niño events? Studies disagree however on whether the probability and magnitude of extreme El Niño events would increase with global warming, which can be largely explained by major differences in the physical mechanisms that control extreme events across climate models and their divergent responses to rising CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Three key ingredients contribute to the occurrence of extreme El Niño events. The first one is westerly wind bursts (WWBs). Lasting several weeks, they occur in the western and central equatorial Pacific at the onset and during the development of El Niño events. Several strong initial bursts in winter, followed by a sequence of WWBs coupled to the underlying sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during El Niño development, can result in a strong positive Bjerknes feedback, leading to a strong El Niño. This positive feedback is responsible for the rapid growth of SST anomalies during El Niño development. Recharge and the subsequent discharge of ocean heat content (OHC) in the western equatorial Pacific is another factor – a larger initial OHC may lead to a stronger El Niño event. Finally, the nonlinearity of wind stress response to SST anomalies related to shifts in atmospheric convection can also amplify El Niño by further strengthening the Bjerknes feedback. When these factors operate together, conditions can become right for the development of an extreme El Niño. Nevertheless, even a strong initial OHC and strong WWBs early in the year do not always lead to an extreme event (as happened for example during the weak 2014 El Niño). Some strong events appear to develop even in the absence of a strong initial OHC (e.g., as in 1982). Furthermore, how climate models replicate these factors can be different between the models and the observations, and across different climate models. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this project is to quantify how the interplay between WWBs, ocean heat content, and convective nonlinearities controls the occurrence of extreme El Niño events in Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and other Earth system models in the present and future climates. To achieve this goal, firstly the project will systematically analyze the temporal and spatial WWB characteristics and their links to extreme El Niño events, using preindustrial, historical, and future climate simulations, and available observations. Then, a broad hierarchy of numerical experiments will be conducted with the aim to investigate the mechanisms and impacts of WWBs. Specifically, mechanism denial experiments will be used to identify the main factors responsible for WWBs, how they are related to tropical cyclones, and how they affect ENSO events. Further, WWB-ENSO interactions will be examined in modified coupled simulations (using the so-called “wind shaving” approach) limiting the effect on the ocean of wind stress induced by WWBs, allowing us to rigorously quantify the impacts of WWBs on ENSO statistics as well as on individual events. We will be able to assess the relative roles of WWBs, OHC, and convection-related nonlinearities in the development of extreme events. We will also investigate the effects of climate warming on WWBs and on their interaction with ENSO. The contribution of WWBs to the skewness and kurtosis of ENSO and their changes with global warming will be examined (these important nonlinear parameters are controlled by strong El Niño events, and many models fail to realistically reproduce them). Ultimately, this project will lead to a better understanding of El Niño dynamics, especially of the occurrence and predictability of extreme El Niño events, with broad socioeconomic benefits stemming from the vast impacts of such events. It will also investigate potential future changes in extreme events with global warming and may help improve ENSO simulation by E3SM and other climate models. Finally, the project will support a postdoctoral associate at Yale University and a graduate student at Harvard University."

Existing wave energy converter (WEC) systems have various shortcomings that present barriers to entry for many offshore power markets, such as cost, reliability, and scalability to support the wide range of power demands across different applications. OPT has developed a concept for a Mass-on-Spring Wave Energy Converter (MOSWEC) which overcomes the shortcomings of existing WECs. The MOSWEC “power module” utilizes a mass-spring oscillator (MSO) housed in an airtight compartment near the bottom of the buoy which can be incorporated into a stand-alone PowerBuoy® by adding a flotation collar around the top, coupled to other MOSWEC power modules to form a larger PowerBuoy®, or scaled up for larger power. All moving parts are isolated from external elements. A buoy using the MOSWEC approach can be much shorter than many other WEC buoys, resulting in lower structural loads, simpler moorings and umbilicals, and simpler launch and recovery operations. The design is inherently modular and scalable, allowing it to address varying power demands across different applications. In the Phase I study, OPT completed conceptual design of the MOSWEC system and analyzed various design configurations to verify estimated power levels of different modular and scaled approaches. A base building block with a 3-tonne reaction mass was developed that is estimated to achieve an average peak power of 2 kW, with different configurations providing power levels up to nearly 30 kW. In addition, two main applications were evaluated for technical and commercial feasibility – integration of a subsea AUV docking station and a topside sensor payload for maritime domain awareness. While both applications were confirmed to be technically feasible, the topside monitoring payload for maritime domain awareness was found to have more near term commercial viability. Development of the MOSWEC technology is anticipated to accelerate market adoption of WECs in several applications, reducing the need for crewed vessel patrols and displacing carbon-emitting sources for subsea power applications. For Phase II, OPT proposes to complete detail design, build, and ocean testing of the initial prototype with a 3-tonne reaction mass, referred to as the “M3” MOSWEC. The M3 prototype will be deployed with a topside payload consisting of radar, camera, and AIS to serve as an offshore vessel monitoring system that has applications in defense and security, monitoring of illegal fishing and marine protected areas, enforcement of safety exclusion zones for offshore construction, and tracking vessels traffic in ports or shipping routes."

A prime example is the field of nuclear forensics, where the elemental/isotopic analysis of individual µm-scale particles of actinide-containing materials is critical to ongoing nuclear non- proliferation efforts. The ability to accurately identify, collect, and relocate individual µm-scale particles thus plays a direct role in ensuring national security, but more broadly these capabilities are increasingly desired across a wide variety of technological sectors where the need to fabricate and manipulate materials on smaller and smaller length scales continues to increase. An instrumental platform has been designed with the ability to efficiently locate individual µm- to nm-scale particles, collect said particles in a non-destructive, non-contaminating manner, and relocate the particles to another substrate for further analysis. The platform employs a simple, widely applicable approach combining optical imaging for fast particle identification and a micromanipulation system for particle relocation, both controlled through custom software capable of automating many aspects of the particle manipulation process. An instrumental platform was constructed and shown to be capable of identifying individual particles of refractory materials with dimensions between 0.1 and 1000 µm, collecting specific particles, and relocating them to another location for further analysis. The developed micromanipulation platform was evaluated using relevant model particle systems and found to be fast and highly reproducible. Phase I thoroughly demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed technology, showing that it can serve as an ideal tool for the manipulation of µm-scale particles and is compatible with any desired ex situ analytical methods. Phase II will focus on the continued development of the manipulation platform demonstrated in Phase I with the ultimate goal of producing a functional prototype system for commercialization. The developed system will be optimized using particle systems relevant to customer needs. Prototyping, software development, customer outreach, and beta-testing in Phase II will produce a robust commercial-ready platform, capable of meeting the needs of current and emerging high- tech applications. The described instrumental platform is customizable and directly applicable to many commercial industries and advanced sectors, including microanalytical fields such as semiconductors, electronics, smart materials, sensors, and nanotechnology. Industries will benefit from the platform’s ability to manipulate specific particles in a nondestructive, noncontaminating manner, enabling the development of domestic high tech manufacturing economies.

Developing solution to this problem at this moment can be impactful because: (1) The prospects of sustained fusion energy is increasing but structural materials technology to build them have not evolved, (2) The development of 4th generation fission reactors to replace ageing nuclear power plants need affordable materials to withstand higher irradiation damage and temperature, and (3) Advanced fuel development program for current fission reactors needs affordable fabrication process to increase the safety, fuel burnup while reduce the radioactive wastes. Hence, development of affordable ODS alloy synthesis and fabrication processes help the nuclear power plants to become more economical and safer. The exceptional properties of nano structured ODS alloys are attributed to their microstructural conditions of oxide nanoclusters featuring very high number density, matrix/particle interfaces capable of trapping helium, and uniform distribution. Use of conventional manufacturing techniques that involve melting will destroy these unique microstructural features. In Phase I, feasibility of consolidating a microstructurally sensitive ODS alloy powder and extruding them into thin-walled tubes in single step was demonstrated using SolidStirTM extrusion technology without destroying the microstructure. In Phase II, we propose to develop and commercialize a scaled-up version of the SolidStir extrusion system to fabricate thin-walled ODS tubes to be used in verity of nuclear and non-nuclear applications. In addition, we also explore feasibility of economically in-situ synthesis ODS alloys during the fabrication process. Successful development and demonstration of the proposed technology for fabricating nano structured ODS ferritic alloys will be directly impactful on current and future advanced nuclear programs in combating the climate crisis and providing energy security. Most importantly, the proposed manufacturing route has the potential to become a path breaking manufacturing route for microstructurally sensitive materials such as mechanically alloyed powders and harder to fabricate high temperature materials that will make the power generation more efficient and safer."

This award supports researchers at Louisiana State University in an experimental program that aims to improve our understanding of the structure and decay properties of atomic nuclei far from stability. Unstable nuclei with many more neutrons than protons typically undergo nuclear beta decay followed by the emission of electromagnetic radiation. For very neutron-rich isotopes a new decay path is possible: beta decay followed by neutron emission. This phenomenon, known as beta-delayed neutron emission, is important for the study of nuclear structure, nuclear astrophysics, nuclear energy, and other applied fields. Our research involves studies of beta-delayed neutron emission using recoil-ion time-of-flight spectroscopy as well as beta-decay studies using internal conversion electron and gamma-ray spectroscopy, all using new instrumentation. Beta-delayed neutron emission studies will be performed with the BEtA Recoil-ion trap (BEARtrap) at the CAlifornium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) to the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). We will perform gamma-ray and conversion-electron spectroscopy of neutron-rich isotopes using two new spectrometers coupled to established gamma-ray spectrometers at ANL and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)"
Allosteric control of electron transfer in nitrogenase-like enzymes,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020965,"Antony, Edwin",Edwin.Antony@saintlouisuniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Allosteric control of electron transfer in nitrogenase-like enzymes Our long-term goal is to understand how enzymes such as nitrogenase and nitrogenase-like enzymes catalyze ATP-dependent multi-electron substrate reduction reactions. The structural design of these enzymes and how they mediate long-range electron transfer (ET) over a series of sophisticated metal centers have served as blueprints for the design of bio-inspired catalysts. Here, we focus on the mechanism of action of two nitrogenase-like enzymes: DPOR (Dark-operative Protochlorophyllide OxidoReductase) and COR (Chlorophyllide a OxidoReductase). Nitrogenase fixes atmospheric dinitrogen in the biological nitrogen cycle, and both DPOR and COR catalyze key reduction reactions in the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathway that is essential for photosynthesis. In addition to their significance in life-sustaining fundamental biological processes, DPOR, COR, and nitrogenase serve as excellent model systems to decipher electron transfer processes that are hallmarks of several reductive enzymes. Nitrogenase and nitrogenase-like enzymes are made of two component proteins: an electron donor and electron acceptor component. The component proteins transiently assemble in the presence of ATP to transfer an electron. Interestingly, the complex is made of two identical halves with the acceptor component arranged in an a2b2 symmetry. Our work has established that the two halves function in an asymmetric manner with catalytic events on one half allosterically controlling the other. The mechanistic and functional significance of this allosteric control is not understood. However, perturbing activities in one half stalls substrate reduction in the entire protein complex. We aim to decipher how assembly of the component proteins, electron transfer, ATP binding and hydrolysis, and substrate reduction contribute to establishing and coordinating allostery within the enzyme complex. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To determine the role of individual catalytic events in establishing asymmetry using single molecule TIRF microscopy. 2) To determine whether asymmetric substrate reduction in conserved in nitrogenase-like enzymes. 3) To develop cryo-EM approaches to obtain structural snapshots of the entire sequence of asymmetric events. Results from the proposed study will yield a mechanistic map of how the two symmetric catalytic halves work together to establish and maintain the sequential-site mechanism through multiple electron cycles to achieve substrate reduction. Understanding the workings of enzymes like nitrogenase, DPOR, and COR that mediate multi-electron redox chemistry is vital for designing bio-inspired tools that enable reduction of nitrogen and other substrates. The research will also train scientists and students in developing single molecule and cryo-EM tools to investigate important biological questions."

Ginsberg, University of California, Berkeley (Principal Investigator) David Limmer, University of California, Berkeley (Co-Principal Investigator) Dmitri Talapin, University of Chicago (Co-Investigator) Samuel Teitelbaum, Arizona State University (Co-Investigator) Building materials out of nanoscale crystals initially suspended in solution has become a vibrant research field because it bears many advantages in material synthesis, including the ability to design materials from the bottom up. For example, the optical and electronic properties of new energy efficient materials can ideally be achieved through the design of the individual nanocrystals and the way they interact with one another to form a solid. These nanocrystals, each only tens of atoms across, are now easily manipulated as building blocks to form larger-scale ordered ‘superlattice’ structures even though their interparticle interactions are much weaker than interatomic ones in traditional solids. These interactions have, however, typically been too weak to support material properties such as the high conductivities observed in traditional solids. This project therefore investigates the underexplored assembly of nanocrystal superlattices with much stronger interparticle interactions than have previously been achieved by decorating the nanocrystals with short, highly charged inorganic molecules and initially solubilizing them in less conventional electrolyte solutions. It characterizes the isolated cases for which the atomic constituents of the nanocrystal have allowed the strong interparticle interactions needed for high conductivity and compares these cases to other ones to devise strategies to improve them to ensure that the desirable superlattice properties can be generally achieved. The superlattice formation process in this system will be observed through small angle X-ray scattering to elucidate its mechanisms under various conditions using novel in situ reactors. The microscopic nanocrystal clusters that are precursors to superlattice formation will also be characterized using nascent microsecond X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy in order to gain insight into the superlattice nucleation mechanisms. The light-induced pre- and post-formation non-equilibrium relaxation dynamics will be followed with ultrafast time resolution using frontier wide- and small-angle X-ray scattering approaches, respectively, at X-ray free electron laser facilities in order to identify and compare the microscopic physical properties that dictate interparticle interactions for differing nanocrystal compositions. These experiments will also serve to investigate the possibility to optically promote the formation of ordered structures out of equilibrium for nanocrystal systems that cannot yet be thus assembled. Together with synthetic design, molecular simulation, and theory, these multiscale studies will identify key aspects that promote or preclude the formation of well-ordered superlattices in which the nanocrystals can strongly couple to one another and will relate them to their emergent properties to enable the development of a series of more sophisticated bottom-up formation strategies to create novel materials with unprecedented electronic, optical, and photochemical functionalities and new energy harvesting, transducing, and storing functionalities. Ultimately, this project will open a new paradigm in the study and control of complex functional energy materials by revealing which microscopic factors most substantially determine the emergent macroscopic structures and the different means by which these outcomes can be controlled through subtle variations in formation conditions."
Fundamental chemical kinetics of siloxane and silicon compounds,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019184,"Wooldridge, Margaret",Margaret.Wooldridge@regentsoftheuniversityofmichigan,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']",". Siloxanes and other silicon compounds play significant roles as impurities in land-fill gas and as primary feedstock materials for high-value and large-volume products, yet the fundamental reaction chemistry of gas-phase silicon compounds remains largely unexplored. The proposed work integrates two complementary experimental efforts to significantly advance the science of gas-phase silicon reaction chemistry. The primary research focus is on the elementary thermal reactions of siloxanes and their decomposition products with a progression in the chemical structure of the compounds studied to elucidate the effects of bond structure. An additional area of interest is the interaction of gas-phase species with silica nanoparticles that are formed naturally as products of the thermal reactions of siloxanes and during oxidation. Experiments will be conducted using the University of Michigan (UM) rapid compression facility (RCF) and the shock tube facility (STF) at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The combination of experimental approaches will allow a broad and complementary range of state conditions to be studied with temperatures in the range of 700-2000 K and pressures of 0.1-50 bar. With the RCF studies, rapid gas-sampling coupled with gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry will be applied to measure stable intermediates and products allowing reaction pathways to be identified and limiting elementary rate coefficients to be determined. Narrow-line laser absorption measurements will be used to measure the formation of the OH radical in the RCF systems as well as to measure the interaction of OH with silicon nanoparticles. Elementary rate coefficients and mechanisms of the thermal decomposition reactions will be determined in studies at ANL with a combination of optical measurements and online mass spectrometry. In addition, the portable ANL mini-STF will be used at the UM to conduct simultaneous laser absorption and time-of-flight mass spectrometry measurements. Together the UM and ANL data sets will be the foundation for accurate models of gas-phase silicon chemistry over a wide range of conditions that is relevant for improving the synthesis of high-cost and high volume materials and for improving energy conversion, durability and control in systems that are challenged by silicon impurities. These would be the first measurements to systematically address such a large spectrum of fundamental gas-phase silicon chemistry and consideration of particle formation kinetics. Successful outcomes will include multiple categories of pioneering data, and directly address the two DOE BES Grand Challenges of Synthesizing new forms of matter with tailored properties and Understanding and controlling material properties emerging from complex atomic and electronic interactions."

Fredrickson, University of Wisconsin-Madison (Principal Investigator) Rie T. Fredrickson, University of Wisconsin-Madison (co-Principal Investigator) Intermetallic phases--the broad family of solid state compounds formed from combinations of metals--represent a vast and under-explored source of potential functional materials. Their wide variety of geometrical arrangements at the atomic level underlies a similarly diverse array of properties, including superconductivity, magnetism, thermoelectric effects, shape memory, and catalysis. Even more intriguing is the existence of complex intermetallic phases in which building blocks or modules from different simpler materials are conglomerated, offering opportunities for modular functionality or emergent properties from the interactions of these components. Realizing this promise, however, is made difficult by two limiting factors: (1) the challenge of designing the synthesis of such materials, and (2) the need for an understanding of the relationship between their geometrical features and their properties. This project, funded by the Office of Basic Energy Science's Materials Chemistry program, takes a theory- and data-guided approach to addressing these issues through the pursuit of three synergistic research objectives: the development of a predictive theory of modular intermetallic structures, the synthesis and characterization of new intermetallics embodying this phenomenon, and the joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the structure-properties relationships in new series of compounds. The theoretical framework for modular intermetallic structures developed in this work focuses on the regions of shared atoms at the interfaces between the building blocks of complex structures. These interface units are initially identified through the examination of existing intermetallic intergrowth structures. Using theoretical tools developed by the PI's group, particularly the Density Functional Theory-Chemical Pressure (DFT-CP) analysis, the driving forces are identified that can motivate fragments of different structures to merge at these interface units. These results are distilled into chemical pressure (CP)-based metrics for the favorability of interface formation between pairs of different structures, as well as the preferred orientations of their interfaces. These models will then be tested and refined by comparing the predictions to the intergrowth structures obtained in searches of the structural literature for compounds containing specific interface units. The theoretical foundation being laid provides the basis for the synthesis and structure determination of new families of modular intermetallic compounds. Here, structural databases are mined for pairs of simple crystal structures that share common geometrical motifs that could serve as interface units. The favorability of their intergrowth are assessed using DFT-CP analysis. Based on these results, ternary systems will be explored synthetically whose binary subsystems contain structures deemed compatible. The synthetic products will be analyzed with powder X-ray diffraction, single crystal X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Through a comparison of the structures of the new phases obtained with the expectations of theory, the concepts for modular intermetallic structures will be refined. In addition, new interface units encountered in these structures will be fed back into the theoretical activities of this project. As new compounds emerge, the modular nature of their structures will be connected to their physical properties. Models for structure-properties relationships will first be developed based on computational proxies for properties, such as the nature of the electrons occupying states at the boundary between filled and empty energy levels, and the stresses arising in the packing of atoms in the materials. The anticipated physical properties and new functionalities of modular structures will be then compared to their parent structures, while the predictions will be tested against experimental measurements, most often of the magnetic properties and heat capacities, as carried out with superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. The successful completion of this project would yield design principles for thermodynamically stable nanostructured materials that allow the navigation of their structure-properties relationships. This work will also contribute to cyber-infrastructure through the continued development of the Intermetallic Reactivity Database and associated theoretical tools for leveraging bonding analysis in the synthesis and design of new intermetallic phases."

The industry has conventionally relied upon the chlor-alkali process and the Solvay process to extract chlorine from salt to produce some of the largest scale chemical commodities, such as chlorine, hydrochloric acid, sodium carbonate, and sodium hydroxide. The chlor-alkali process, however, is too energy intensive, results in excessive greenhouse gas emissions, and supplies products in ratios that are disproportionate to demand. The Solvay and mining approaches to producing sodium carbonate are unearthing carbon dioxide for release into the atmosphere at a time when industry should instead be using captured carbon to produce valuable carbonate products. A new process is undergoing development to profitably extract chlorine from salt systems. This extraction of chlorine enables diverse options for subsequent separations or synthesis of other salable minerals and chemicals. This flexible approach to extracting chlorine has the potential to substantially displace the chlor- alkali process, Solvay process, and mining processes for producing sodium carbonate. The processing options include the opportunity to spontaneously and directly absorb carbon dioxide from air through mineral carbonation on the domestic scale of about 10 million tonnes per year. The Phase I and II projects demonstrated the technical feasibility of the chlorine extraction process. A transport membrane condenser technology can benefit the process by enhancing the collection of hydrochloric acid and heat. The program has also demonstrated the technical feasibility of incorporating the chlorine extraction process into a larger approach to profitably process bitterns and other mixed sea salt systems into salable minerals. These bitterns are a rich mineral resource that is a byproduct of salt production through the solar evaporation of seawater that is presently not being exploited. The techno- economic analysis of the Phase II project, however, quantified a strong potential for the proposed technology to finally enable the profitable processing of bitterns into salable minerals. The efficient extraction of chlorine drives the profitability of the overall process. The Phase IIA project will complete the scale up of the chlorine extraction and membrane-based collection process to a semi-continuous prototype and further develop the techno-economic analyses to substantiate the process profitability and commercialization. The large-scale extraction of chlorine, minerals, and other products central to the chemical industry from previously unusable salt commodities would enhance the productivity of the salt industry, improve resource management, and increase energy efficiency in domestic manufacturing. With potential process scales on the order of several million tons of mixed salt per year, the resulting byproducts of the process will lower the feedstock costs for fertilizer, plastics, water treatment, metal/steel, paper/pulp, and carbon sequestration industries."

Although chiral phenomena have been studied extensively in organic realm, relevant study on inorganic condensed matter systems has been limited, but it would potentially open up exciting opportunity if chiral inorganic counterparts can be achieved in the well-defined crystalline form. As compared with biological and organic chiral systems, crystalline chiral inorganic matters can offer better control of periodicity and morphology from the atomic scale, thus representing unique test beds to understand and tailor chiroptical response and chirality-dependent physical processes, including chirality-induced spin selectivity at high temperature. The objective of this project is to advance a new class of well-defined chiral metals and their hybrid nanostructures from the bottom-up, and employ them as emerging condensed matter platform to explore chirality-spin coupling effects via materials design. This project will adopt a two-pronged approach by combining novel ultrafast all optical spectroscopic tools with precisely tailored materials controls from the bottom-up to investigate a few chirality entangled spin-dependent processes. This project directly addresses several of the missions of the DOE BES program, and is aimed at developing a new type of synergistically coupled inorganic chiral nanostructures to allow integration of structural chirality with other functionalities, including plasmons, excitons and spin. This initiative is highly interdisciplinary, and the results should impact a broad range of condensed matter physics and nanoscience. This work should also stimulate substantial theoretical interest in designing and modeling of chiral inorganic nanostructures to achieve desirable properties and functionalities.

Through new design concepts together with creation and development of versatile structural platforms, this project aims to advance fundamental materials-design science and to generate both scientific and technological impact in energy-related applications such as fuel storage (e.g., H2, CH4), gas separation (e.g., C2H2/CO2 , C2H4/C­2H6), and harmful gas removal and sequestration (e.g., CO2, NH3). A unique feature of this project is its ability to generate a highly stable materials platform with unmatched tunability. Such materials can exhibit high uptake capacity, high gas selectivity, and variable binding energy, all of which are desirable for energy-efficient gas storage and separation applications. The porous material type created by the PI's group is a highly successful and versatile platform known as pacs, based on metal-organic frameworks with uniformly partitioned pores. The pore-partition agent contributes dramatically to the stability and exceptional gas uptake properties of the pacs materials, even with low binding energy which is beneficial for low-energy adsorbent regeneration. The research proposed in this project will take the project to a new level of multi-modular design by taking advantage of strong synergistic effects and multi-directional structure directing mechanisms between the framework formation, pore space partition, and heterometallic trimer formation. This project employs a comprehensive approach for the design, discovery, and fundamental understanding of the pacs materials. The research project integrates synthesis, crystal structure determination, and topology analysis, as well as other various characterizations. Sorption properties of various gases under different temperature and pressure, together with breakthrough experiments of mixed gases, will be evaluated to develop composition-structure-property correlations. The results will further serve as feedback to refine materials design strategies. These materials represent a new generation of porous materials capable of integrating high-density guest binding sites with tunable guest-binding affinity.

In measuring we continue to create, or assemble, large mechanical property and microstructure databases on leading candidate tempered martensitic steels (TMS or RAFM) and nanostructured ferritic alloys (NFA or ODS) structural materials for use in He-rich irradiation environments. We model He transport, fate and consequences under intense displacement damage conditions. We further derive what we call reduced order models, that are verified, fine-tuned and calibrated by fits to the large experimental databases. These models provide quantitative engineering predictions of changes in constitutive properties, fracture toughness and void swelling as a function of the combination the relevant variables like dpa, dpa rate, He/dpa and temperature (Ti) as well as test, or service, condition variables, like temperature, stress state and strain/loading rate. The databases indicates that TMS alloys will suffer severe embrittlement in the fusion environment at high fluence due to the synergistic effects of dpa and He on irradiation hardening along with weakening of grain boundaries. High He also reduces the incubation dpa for void swelling that may reach levels of 15% or more at 200 dpa.

Since their first demonstration for having significant ORR activity in acidic media by Ozkan and her group in 2006, carbon-based electrocatalysts have shown potential to replace more expensive alternatives for various applications. Nitrogen-doped carbon (CNx) materials have a heterogeneous structure with many proposed active sites, which present unique challenges in gaining fundamental understanding on the catalytic activity of these materials. The work outlined in this proposal will focus on understanding the active sites and mechanistic steps for ORR, OER and BER on these materials, using fundamental approaches based on catalysis, electrochemistry and computational modeling. The primary objectives of the project are (i) develop an understanding of the active sites and mechanistic steps involved in ORR, OER and BER over CNx catalysts, (ii) develop synthesis strategies that will afford better control of the various N sites on CNx, (iii) develop strategies for using probe molecules to identify/quantify active sites, (iv) develop strategies for tuning the properties of these materials by doping with other heteroatoms, and (v) integrate the ex-situ, in-situ and operando characterization studies with DFT-based modeling efforts to complement and leverage the strengths and limitations of the two approaches and through these studies gain insight into the surface restructuring that takes place under operating conditions. Our work plan will include varying the synthesis techniques and parameters, including chemical and electrochemical routes and use of different precursors, with different nitrogen groups and chemical structures. We plan to use selective poisons and site blockers to help identify and quantify active sites and design doping (P, B, O, halogen) strategies to enhance the CNx activity/selectivity by changing the electronic structure around the active sites. We also plan to integrate a range of new in situ/operando experimental characterization techniques, consisting of near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), IR and Raman spectroscopy, and near-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. To enable operando characterization, we will use custom built electrochemical cells designed in our labs to explore the surface restructuring under operating conditions. DFT will be used to assist in interpreting the spectroscopy by predicting XPS binding energy shifts along with adsorbate vibrational spectroscopy. Electrocatalytic activity and selectivity testing combined with DFT predictions of activity for specific CNx models will establish refined structure-activity relationships. Our previous work on CNx materials as electrocatalysts have shown promising activity for many low-temperature applications in acidic media, such as ORR catalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC), as OER catalysts in regenerative fuel cells, and as oxygen depolarized cathodes in hydrochloric acid or bromic acid electrolysis. Although CNx materials as electrocatalysts have been studied for some time, there are widely differing views on the active sites and the mechanistic steps in ORR and OER. And to the best of our knowledge, other than our preliminary work, there are no reports on using CNx for BER. Any electrocatalytic system that can have multi-functional characteristics is of great practical interest. The relevance to the DOE-BES mission lies in the need to acquire a fundamental understanding of the catalytic and electrocatalytic phenomena involved in oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and halide evolution reactions. While the questions to be addressed in the study and the approaches to be taken to answer them are fundamental, the results will have far-reaching implications for the energy future."
Entanglement Enhanced Quantum Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy Imaging Lab on a Chip,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023337,"Yi, Xu",Xu.Yi@therectorandvisitorsoftheuniversityofvirginia,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Stimulated Raman spectroscopy imaging is used in numerous biological imaging applications for its capability of resolving dense or overlapping vibrational spectral bands as well as spatially differentiating the molecular distribution. However, both spectral and spatial resolutions of classical nondestructive stimulated Raman bio-imaging are constrained by the input optical power to avoid photodamaging of biological samples. Integrating quantum enhancement into nonlinear bioimaging will allow imaging of biomolecular distributions at resolutions not reachable by classical techniques. In this project, we propose to develop a chip-based quantum Raman (qRam) spectroscopic approach for the characterization of the molecular distribution of plant cells, specifically for plants that have been subjected to stress. Plant biomass is a natural resource for biofuel, and is predominately made up of cell walls, a three-dimensional complex of multiple polymer networks. Understanding the interaction and cooperation among the various wall polymers is necessary both for fundamental plant biology and for devising strategies to alter the qualitative composition of wall materials for the sake of achieving more efficient utilization of biomass as an energy source. The proposed qRam will be used to measure Raman spectral shifts in tension wood, a type of efficient biofuel, with spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity beyond the state-of-art classical Raman spectroscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Our demonstration, if successful, will be an important step forward toward the quantum-enhanced characterization of biomass."

Details of this architecture naturally support a target that is illuminated by two opposed beams. Several preliminary designs have been developed to exploit this space, including a novel Direct-Drive Hybrid target design, termed the DDH, which seeks to benefit from recent advances in the field. Physics-based modeling would inform Xcimer of the tradeoffs in this approach, identify risks and options for improvement, and lead to an integrated system with reduced cost and complexity. This program would leverage the unique tools and expertise available at the University of Rochester's (UR's) Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE). The codes LILAC and DRACO have been developed and validated against an extensive set of experimental data, and include the necessary aspects of laser absorption, x-ray production, and hydrodynamics. Xcimer Energy and LLE will work to implement a version of the hybrid design in both codes, and LLE will evaluate aspects of the DDH in 1-D and 2-D. Outputs will reduce uncertainty with respect to hybrid drive, the techniques used to obtain good implosion symmetry with two-sided illumination, and the potential for high gain. Findings could apply broadly to many types of driver, increase the parameter space available to IFE, and motivate more extensive partnerships in the broader community."

Electrocatalytic reactions at the core of artificial photosynthesis, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries involve multiple electron-transfer steps. Arguably, for a given type of mono-functional catalysts, e.g., transition metals, the adsorption-energy scaling relations of descriptor species, e.g., *CO, *OH, and *H, with kinetics-determining intermediates and transition states limit the efficiency of electrical/chemical energy conversions. One of the possible strategies to break such linear correlations is to design multi-functional sites with solid solutions of two or multiple elements. While the concept has been conceived for decades, predictive models are needed to formulate this type of materials with commercially viable catalytic performance. To narrow down the scope, we are investigating electrocatalytic CO2 reduction at binary solid solutions of Cu with non-precious d10 metals (e.g., Zn, Ga, Sn, and Bi) toward 2e- transfer products, such as CO because of its easy separation and as a sustainable feedstock for synthesis of hydrocarbons/alcohols. We hypothesize that by harnessing intermediate-specific electronic structure responses of chemical bonding at metal-electrolyte interfaces, solid solutions of Cu with weakly CO-binding d10-metals can be designed such that the kinetics of CO2 reduction toward CO at multi-functional sites is optimized while the competing HCOO- and H2 evolution pathways are suppressed to some extent. With graph representations of solvated adsorbate-substrate systems, a transferrable and physically interpretable deep learning framework that hybridizes convolutional neural networks and Newns-Anderson-type Hamiltonians can be developed to predict energetics of elementary charge-transfer steps, and thereby unraveling experimentally actionable factors governing interfacial electrokinetics. Research results from this project will help guide technological developments in enhancing our energy and raw materials dependence on domestic feedstocks, and have the potential for diverse transformations across the field of catalysis. The open-source data science tools will advance the theoretical development of interfacial electrocatalysis and our basic understanding of structure-reactivity relationships of heterogeneous catalysts for energy and environmental applications. The integration of ab initio simulations, physics-based models, and deep learning algorithms offers exceptional possibilities to facilitate materials development and create the opportunity to enter a new paradigm in catalyst design based on fundamentals and materials data rather than trial and error."
Understanding Twinning and Deformation in High Entropy Alloys,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023232,"Aidhy, Dilpuneet",Dilpuneet.Aidhy@clemsonuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","One of the most critical challenges in the alloy industry is to achieve a combination of both high strength and high ductility in one alloy. While it is commonly observed that there is a trade-off between the two properties, mechanical deformation studies have shown that it can be achieved by changing the deformation mechanism from slip to twinning if twin boundaries could be induced in the microstructure. On the one hand, twin boundaries act as barriers to dislocations, whereas on the other hand, they provide long and smooth pathways that promote glide of dislocations. Recently, some compositions of multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs), including high entropy alloys (HEAs), are found to possess the unique combination of high strength and high ductility and seem to break away from the normal trade-off trend. In these alloys, the formation of large number of twin boundaries is correlated to their low stacking fault energy (SFE). This lowering of SFE has been further tied to the formation of specific local atomic-level chemistries via segregation at the stacking faults. The objective of this work is to understand the underlying key features at the atomic level that result in lowered SFE. Based on recent results, we hypothesize that the increase in charge density at the stacking fault due to specific atomic chemistry results in reduced SFE. In this proposal, we will focus on Ni-based MPEAs whose deformation twinning and segregation responses have been studied recently. Using atomistic calculations including density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported by machine-learning data-science methods, we will elucidate the effect of specific local nearest-neighbor chemistries that could lower SFE and facilitate twin boundary formation in MPEAs. The successful completion of this project will lead to a fundamental understanding of the correlation between alloy chemistry and twinning. In addition, a machine-learning-based computational approach will be formulated to predict accurate SFE from DFT, which is currently a major bottleneck in DFT. Finally, this work will advance data-science methods applied to materials science, which is a rapidly growing area of national interest."
"Diagrammatic Monte Carlo Approach to Real-frequency Response Functions and the Spin-Fermion Model of Hot Spots

Prokofiev, University of Massachusetts, Amherst (Principal Investigator) I. Tupitsyn, University of Massachusetts, Amherst (Co-Investigator) We address two outstanding problems in the field of interacting quantum matter, namely the computation of frequency and momentum resolved response functions for Coulomb systems and the Fermi surface reconstruction at the so-called hot spots in doped Mott insulators (Spin-Fermion model). After decades of research efforts, recent breakthrough advances in the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method (DiagMC) finally allow us to solve both problems with controlled accuracy. DiagMC combines advantages of two radically different, but equally universal, techniques: Feynman diagrams within the analytical quantum-field theoretical framework and Monte Carlo sampling of complex configuration spaces. The diagrammatic approach has been very successful in producing accurate data for phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties, but, until recently, the dynamic response was out of reach because finite temperature calculations were performed in the imaginary time/frequency domain and real-frequency results were recovered by performing an ill-conditioned numerical analytic continuation procedure. The breakthrough observation is that real-frequency answers can be computed directly from Feynman diagrams using analytic techniques, including cases with renormalized propagators and retarded effective interactions. We will develop the DiagMC method capable of computing momentum and real-frequency resolved response functions at finite temperature for a homogeneous electron gas, and using them for precise characterization of the dynamic exchange-correlation kernel (key quantity in the formulation of the time-dependent density functional theory) and studies of optical and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra in metals. The Spin-Fermion model was formulated as a semi-phenomenological theory for near critical metals. It has found a wide range of applications in the physics of cuprates and iron-based superconductors to explain the ``strange metal"" behavior and to suggest a possible pairing mechanism for high-temperature superconductivity. The remarkable effect of strong correlations within the Spin-Fermion model is the Fermi surface deformation (reconstruction) that results in the formation of flat regions satisfying the nesting condition (hot-spots) for the interaction. All existing results on the model rely on various uncontrolled approximations. We aim at producing systematic error-free solutions for weak and intermediate range coupling in combination with studies of how an effective field theory emerges from microscopic models. Precise numerical methods advance our understanding of microscopic and collective quantum phenomena and are of vital interdisciplinary importance for both fundamental and applied areas. This research contributes to the broad community effort aimed at advancing the interdisciplinary field of Precision Many-Body Physics with researchers from different sub-fields of natural sciences combining their analytical, numerical, and experimental expertise to achieve ``precise understanding of properties of strongly correlated many-body systems"" by (i) developing effective descriptions and scenarios addressing the relevant degrees of freedom; (ii) performing precise experiments that challenge established paradigms; (iii) developing new, more accurate and effective methods and techniques, capable of describing many strongly interacting degrees of freedom with controlled accuracy; (iv) cross-validating theoretical predictions against accurate experimental data."

These modern systems can operate at higher magnetic fields and elevated temperatures enabling more practical, compact systems, but one of key challenges associated with HTS is a slow propagation of the normal zone that complicates early detection of thermal runaway (quench). Traditional approaches such as voltage-based techniques are often insensitive to early indications of quench due to modern systems requiring field ramping rates up to several Tesla a second (T/s) causing additional plasma currents which impose strong time-varying ac magnetic fields on the conductor, leading to additional inductive voltage noise which further complicates voltage-based quench detection. We propose unique non-voltage quench detection based upon mechanical stress wave propagation. Over the last ten years, Etegent has been developing a new sensing technology which utilizes the propagation of stress waves through a solid metallic (or other solid materials) waveguide. This approach is akin to fiber-optic sensors except rather than transmitting optical energy via an optical fiber, the vibrational (ultrasonic) energy is transmitted through a solid fiber-like waveguide. Like fiber-optic sensors, the waveguide can be built into a monitored object to measure local variation of strain or temperature, but unlike fiber-optic sensors, mechanical waveguides are constructed of robust materials, and operate at much lower frequencies, eliminating the need for expensive, complex, and highly sensitive receivers and data processing equipment. This approach is expected to be both robust to the challenging environment of HTS, while providing additional quench detection sensitivity. During Phase I, Etegent will work with our partner, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Accelerator Technology & Applied Physics Division we plan to evaluate the suitability and practical limitations of a mechanical stress waveguide temperature sensor. The plan includes testing the sensor at cryogenic temperatures, integrating the sensor into high temperature superconductor cables, and developing an actionable plan to further the development. Cryogenic distributed temperature sensing technology have many potential benefits in additional to HTS magnet quench detection. HTS-based infrastructure such as superconducting grid and machinery such as HTS-based motors and generators can equally benefit from this technology. Beyond the quench detection application, a broader use is anticipated in space and rocket applications, cryogenic thermal monitoring in a variety of industrial and future transportation applications, medical equipment, cryo-electronic devices and quantum computing."

Conventional approaches for demonstrating compliance rely on the expertise of individuals for interpreting data, configuring proper estimations, performing calculations, etc. Additionally, changes in facility configurations requires significant personnel effort in configuring equipment, reanalyzing data, and rerunning calculations. A low cost, automatic, and accurate approach is to create a software package that contains data acquisition, data preprocessing, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for interpreting the data, and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). In Phase I, we used actual data obtained from JLab to validate our algorithms. The first step is to apply advanced deep learning and machine learning algorithms to predict radiation levels. Several conventional and deep learning algorithms were developed. Our results clearly showed that the radiation prediction is very accurate. The benefit of these results is significant; the results imply that in cases where a detector fails to respond, or whose response is erratic, the estimated measurement result can be reconstructed using a simple model similar to what was implemented. The second step is to construct a dense radiation map based on very sparse sensor measurements in a given laboratory. More than five conventional and one deep learning based inpainting algorithms have been investigated. The dense maps generated by using one of the inpainting algorithms are also accurate. Therefore, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach. In Phase II, we will develop a software prototype containing radiation prediction algorithms, dense radiation map algorithms, and background radiation prediction algorithms. Actual data will be used to evaluate the prototype. Our direct customers include the DOE facilities, nuclear power plants, medical research facilities, and possibly nuclear submarines.

Exploiting the progress in nanofabrication and characterization of functionalized 3D-printed microscopic building blocks, we will target the most challenging question in active matter: What are the fundamental principles controlling the hierarchical organization of materials out of equilibrium? The main research thrusts include: (i) Fabricating active microblocks with multiresponsive behaviors, (ii) exploring novel types of self-propulsion, (iii) enabling large-scale hierarchical self-assemblies of microblocks, and (iv) developing novel theoretical approaches.

Invizyne Technologies has developed cell-free enzymatic systems that have the potential to increase the overall efficiency of the conversion process and bring down the cost of renewable products. A Techno Economic Analysis identified the cost of using purified cofactors as a main driver of cost of cell-free bioconversions. Bringing down the cost of cofactors will be a critical improvement that will allow for the widespread adoption of this technology. We will bring down the cost of cofactors by developing an alternative process to incorporate low-cost crude cofactor mixes from microbial waste streams. In phase I we quantified the cofactor pools in industrial strains of yeast and E. coli and demonstrated that they can be effectively integrated into a cell-free enzymatic reaction to make terpenes. In phase II we enriched these lysates in for high concentrations of ATP and used them to produce long chain carotenoid Beta carotene. In phase IIA we plan to continue development on generating ATP from microbial waste and implementing cell free enzymatic pathways to run inside this enriched cofactor lysate. The crude cofactors sourced from industrial E. coli or yeast to produce an initial carotenoid product called astaxanthin. Our end goal is to produce astaxanthin at industrial relevant titers and scales (10g/L at a 10L scale). Cell free enzymatic bioconversions have the potential to revolutionize the green chemicals industry by lowering the overall cost of production. This cell free approach can also make bio-based chemicals that are impossible to produce in organisms because of their toxicity and therefore can be used to make rare and expensive chemicals more accessible."

Project Description: GENESIS addresses the bottleneck created by conventional intuition-guided synthesis - an inefficient, rate-limiting process - by pioneering a science-based approach to synthesis that will transform how we search for new functional materials. We will resolve synthesis pathways experimentally to interrogate how the composition, structure, and heterogeneity of multi-component reactive system evolve following a free-energy pathway. Developments of in situ diagnostics for synthesis will be leveraged to build a fundamental understanding of the interplay between synthesis conditions, reaction pathways, and material products over Å-to-mm length scales. Potential Impact of the Project: The primary impact of GENESIS will be an improved understanding of synthesis reaction mechanisms, especially in the areas that bridge and combine energy deposition and diffusion across length scales. Specifically, we will produce a framework for understanding how to effectively stabilize materials in states that are far from their global thermodynamic minimum—a relatively unexplored and poorly understood frontier of materials research – by utilizing theory and modeling in combination with diffraction and spectroscopy tools sensitive to atomic scale processes, and x-ray imaging tools to experimentally capture interfacial and particle-wide phenomena. The de novo prediction of synthesis routes will facilitate the realization of new materials identified within other DOE research programs, such as the EFRCs, that identify hypothetical materials through computational materials discovery, or materials that implement new design rules for higher capacity batteries and more selective catalysts. The tools that have been designed and developed for science-based synthesis, will be deployed, for example at DOE user facilities, so a broader community can control the synthesis of families of materials beyond those of specific interest to GENESIS."

Thus one needs spin polarized beams and therefore the ability to simulate and optimize the beam polarization. Our proposed work deals with spin dynamics in electron (positron) storage rings. It has two interrelated parts, the simulation of the polarization via Monte Carlo spin-orbit tracking and the optimization of the polarization. We concentrate on extending the software to facilitate these by developing the tools of the software library Bmad at Cornell University. These tools could be beneficial to future colliders with spin polarization such as the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), and electron-positron colliders such as the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). The scientific focus of these machines will be the study of the nucleon and nuclear structure, and testing of the Standard Model of particle physics, respectively. The numerical-optimization part of our work focuses on whether the electron polarization lifetime can be improved by optimizing the machine parameters via a procedure called spin matching. For circular colliders this includes optimizing the layout of the special spin rotators. Our proposed work on Monte Carlo spin-orbit tracking is based on a system of stochastic differential equations whose completion we accomplished in 2019 (by including, e.g., the Sokolov-Ternov effect). We believe that our numerical work and software will substantially improve older approaches w.r.t. efficiency and accuracy. Our Monte Carlo spin-orbit tracking will be developed together with Etienne Forest of KEK and thus it is primarily based on PTC/FPP, which is a software simulation toolkit designed by Forest. A secondary choice is to develop a multi-level stochastic ODE solver. Our spin matching work is based on existing facilities of Bmad and their further development. We aim also to include the beam-beam interaction which is challenging in colliders. The postdoc and the graduate student on this project will not only be able to contribute at a high level to numerical spin-orbit simulation in general, but they will also be fortunate to learn from several leaders in Accelerator Science and contribute to a state-of-the-art accelerator project. In addition they will get a great exposure to the world of applied science. All in all, these will prepare them well for a career in Accelerator Science in general and beam dynamics in particular."

In oxygenic photosynthesis, the initial charge separation events occurs with near unit quantum efficiency in the photosystem II reaction center (PSII RC). PSII is the only known natural enzyme that uses solar energy to split water. The primary motivation of the proposed work is to elucidate the design principles critical for our fundamental understanding of photosynthesis and for our ability to mimic PSII’s remarkable properties. This goal requires developing new approaches to connect structure to function; a particularly challenging task in PSII where the overlapping electronic transitions of the many pigments obscure their individual roles in the system’s electronic excited states and charge separation process. With the overarching goal of improving our understanding of the structure-function relationship in the PSII RC, we propose parallel studies of spectroscopically simpler systems including PSII grown under far red light, model dyads and other reaction centers including the purple bacterial reaction center (BRC) and the heliobacterial reaction center (HbRC). In these studies we address the following open questions: 1) How can we test and refine structure-based exciton models of photosynthetic reaction centers? 2) How can we relate structure to charge separation mechanisms in photosynthetic reaction centers? 3) Do electronic-vibrational resonances enhance photosynthetic energy transfer and charge separation? The proposed work builds on our previous development of simple and high signal-to-noise approaches to 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to establish a new multispectral paradigm that enables a direct view of electronic couplings, exciton and charge transfer states, revealing energy transfer and charge separation processes over a broad range of frequencies with ultrafast time resolution. Using broadband 2DES across the ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared regime, we will access multiple pigment transitions to aid in dissecting excitonic structure and obtain a wealth of spectroscopic markers of charge separation. By accessing mid-infrared transitions with 2DEV, we will exploit pigment-specific transitions to unravel the sequence of charge separation events and gain insight into electronic-vibrational coupling. Fluorescence-detected 2DES will offer improved ability to resolve weak electronic coupling and separate signal contributions. In addition, 2D electronic Stark spectroscopy promises to reveal charge transfer states and their role in charge separation. We will apply our full array of multispectral multidimensional spectroscopies to wild-type and mutant PSII RCs, BRCs and HbRCs to elucidate the role of the different pigments in the electronic structure and charge separation processes. Combined with simulation, these studies will enable us to test and refine electronic structure and charge separation models of the PSII RC, using the BRC and HbRC as parallel and spectroscopically simpler systems in which to test and validate our approach. These extensive studies of photosynthetic reaction centers address the fundamental structure-function relationship in these important systems to meet the grand challenge of elucidating the design principles used by nature for converting sunlight into chemical energy. The proposed studies will push the development of new methods for simulating multidimensional spectra and refining electronic structure. The newly developed experimental tools will be widely applicable to artificial light-harvesting systems to yield new information about the temporal dynamics and mechanisms of energy transfer and charge separation, giving important experimental feedback for improving their design."

The first catalyst is a transition-metal oxide that oxidizes chloride ion in solution to form hypochlorite ion, the key ingredient in household bleach. The second catalyst is a suspension of nanoparticles that speed up the reaction between the bleach formed in the first step and alcohol substrates that can be prepared from biomass-derived feedstocks such as ethanol, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and glycerol. Overall, these catalysts have the potential to generate high-value commodity chemicals such as acetic acid, diformylfuran, glyeraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone. The chemcial mechanisms of the individual catalyzed reactions are not well known—particularly for earth-abundant metal oxide catalysts. Therefore, the project develops the fundamental science needed to realize this tandem approach: preparing the catalysts, determining how size, shape, and defects in the catalyst particles affects the rate of each transformation, and using DOE facilities to probe any changes in the catalysts during chemical reactions. This research advances the DOE Catalysis Science mission of developing electromediated approaches to catalysis using earth-abundant materials. The tandem catalysis approach is frequently employed in molecular catalysis, but not in heterogeneous (particle) catalysis. A benefit of this work is to bridge concepts from these two communities in a effort to spark new ideas for catalyst design. Discovering how defects on metal oxide surfaces influence their reactivity has impact in a wide range of electrocatalytic and heterogeneous catalytic reactions."

Methanogenesis is further an essential component of the breakdown of organic matter in many environments that lack oxygen. In this project we have focus on understanding the microbial biochemistry underlying utilization of methylated substrates by methanogens; particularly methylamines. Growth and methane formation from methylamines by Methanosarcina spp. requires the prerequisite formation of methyl-CoM, the direct methane precursor. We have shown that enzyme systems have evolved for the methylation of CoM with trimethylamine (TMA), dimethylamine (DMA), and monomethylamine (MMA). Each methyltransferase preferentially binds TMA, DMA, or MMA as substrate to methylate a cognate corrinoid binding protein (aka, corrinoid protein). These distinct yet homologous corrinoid proteins are then demethylated by a single methyltransferase to methylate CoM for the ultimate production of methane. The three types of methylamine methyltransferases genes are not homologous, yet each contains an in-frame amber codon. In previous project periods we have shown this amber codon stands for pyrrolysine, an atypical genetically encoded amino acid, and shown how pyrrolysine is biosynthesized and genetically encoded. More recently we have shown pyrrolysine is essential for efficient catalysis by the TMA specific methyltransferase as homologs of the methyltransferase lacking the residue are instead methyltransferases for larger methylamines. For corrinoid proteins to function in passage of methyl groups from methylamines to CoM to form methane, the central cobalt ion of the corrinoid cofactor (similar to vitamin B12) must be in the highly reducing Co(I) state and return to this state after donating the methyl group to CoM. Accidental oxidation of the corrinoid protein to the Co(II) state inactivates methyl transfer. The redox potential required to reactivate the Co(II)-corrinoid to the Co(I)-state is much lower than generally available in biological systems. However, an iron-sulfur protein called RamA can catalyze the ATP dependent reduction of Co(II)corrinoid protein to the highly reducing Co(I) state. Our predicted structural models of the corrinoid protein-RamA complex have led us to heuristic hypotheses of how the FeS protein RamA couples ATP hydrolysis to the low potential reduction of the Co(II)-corrinoid protein. For this project period, we have devised experiments that test these hypotheses while we continue to characterize basic traits of the protein’s activity. We have established collaborations to solve the structure of RamA in complex with corrinoid protein; and measure the < -700 mV potential of the Co(II)/Co(I) states. The ATP binding domain of RamA is most similar to enzymes known as kinases, proteins that phosphorylate metabolites or proteins with ATP. We will determine if RamA carries out reactions which are hallmarks of kinases, such as an ATP:Pi exchange reaction. We will also test if RamA phosphorylates itself or corrinoid protein during the catalytic cycle. Finally, we have evidence that an uncharacterized and soluble H2 dependent system exists in the model methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri which provides reducing power to RamA. Our preliminary data indicates RamA exists in complex with unknown proteins in cell extracts, and using flexible approaches we will identify proteins and cofactors required for RamA reduction with H2. If this effort is successful, it will lead to a defined ATP-dependent biological system capable of reducing a very low potential metal cofactor with H2, a compound of higher relative redox potential."

Piecuch, Michigan State University (Principal Investigator) This proposal describes a continuing effort to develop, disseminate, and apply new gen­erations of ab ini­tio electronic structure approaches and computer codes exploiting the exponential wave function ansatz of coupled-cluster (CC) theory, which enable precise modeling of mo­lecular processes and prop­erties relevant to energy science, including, but not limited to, com­bustion, ca­talysis, photochemis­try, and harnessing light to drive and control chemical reactivity. The emphasis is on meth­ods that offer high accuracy, ease of use, and lower com­putational costs com­pared to other ap­proaches that aim at similar precision, so that one can study complex molecular prob­lems with dozens or hun­dreds of at­oms, in addition to smaller systems, in a predictive and sys­tematically improvable manner, sup­porting ongoing experiments or in the absence of experimental information. The proposed new effort concentrates on (i) a novel CC formalism, abbreviated as CC(P;Q), and its extension to the electronically excited and open-shell states via the equation-of-motion (EOM) methodology, including states that display a substan­tial multireference character, in which the previously ex­ploited stochastic configuration interaction (CI) Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) propagations in the many-electron Hilbert space, used to identify the dominant higher–than–doubly excited de­terminants for the inclusion in the initial steps of the CC(P;Q) algorithm, are replaced by the selected CI approach ab­breviated as CIPSI; (ii) externally corrected CC (ec-CC) methods using the three- and four-body clusters ex­tracted from se­lected CI (e.g., CIPSI) runs and correcting the resulting energies for the missing many-electron corre­lation effects with the help of moment expansions similar to those defining the CC(P;Q) theories, along with the utilization of the selected-CI-driven ec-CC frame­work in formu­lating a new type of multireference CC technique, in which the relatively inex­pensive sequences of Hamiltonian diagonaliza­tions provide the desired multi­configurational reference states; and (iii) devel­opment of a new type of the adap­tive, self-correcting, “black-box” CC(P;Q) methodol­ogy, which will allow one to converge the high-level CC and EOMCC energetics in single- as well as mul­tireference situations at the small frac­tion of the computational effort and without having to rely on non-CC concepts. We will continue our work toward the de­velopment of semi-stochastic CC(P;Q) theo­ries, especially their extensions to excited and open-shell states, the cluster-analysis-driven FCIQMC framework aimed at recovering the exact, full CI, energetics in weakly as well as strongly correlated systems, new generations of approximate coupled-pair methods that can handle larger numbers of strongly correlated electrons with an ease of a single-reference CC computation, and extending the single and double elec­tron-attachment and ionization EOMCC meth­odologies to the triple elec­tron-at­tachment and triple ioniza­tion cases, which can be use­ful in studies of triradicals and inorganic chromo­phores, of interest in solar energy con­ver­sion schemes, which emerge out of d3 electronic configurations. We will also enrich the previously developed linear scal­ing, local correlation CC codes ex­ploiting the cluster-in-molecule framework, and their multi-level ex­tensions allowing one to mix dif­fer­ent levels of electronic structure theory in a single computation, which can take advantage of mod­ern, mas­sively par­allel com­puter plat­forms, by the active-space CC and CC(P;Q) op­tions. Among the pro­posed appli­ca­tions are radi­cal-radical reac­tions rele­vant to com­bustion, singlet–triplet gaps and elec­tronic excita­tion spectra of poly­acenes, elec­tronic structure of chains, rings, and three-dimensional lattices of hydro­gen atoms that can be used to model metal-insulator transitions, and computational studies of super pho­toreagents. The proposed approaches address some of the most important challenges of modern electronic structure theory, including the development of practical and system­atically improvable com­putational schemes aimed at an accurate description of chemical reaction pathways and molecular electronic exci­tations in the gas and condensed phases, and strongly correlated materials. The pro­posed methods will find use in a wide variety of molec­ular applications relevant to energy science and continue to be shared at no cost with the community via the GAMESS package and established open-source mechanisms, such as GitHub.

Interactive effects of press and pulse disturbances on biogeochemical cycling of a wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,89243021SSC000076,"Reed, Sasha",Sasha.Reed@usgeologicalsurvey,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Tropical forests represent one of Earth’s most active biogeochemical engines: Although only ~12% of the planet’s terrestrial surface supports tropical forests, they account for over 2/3 of live terrestrial plant biomass, nearly one-third of all soil carbon, and these forests exchange more carbon dioxide with the atmosphere than any other terrestrial biome. The primary objective of the proposed work is to use a one-of-a kind field warming experiment in Puerto Rico and a cutting-edge modeling approach to advance a robust, predictive understanding of how the individual and interacting disturbances of increasing temperatures and altered precipitation affect above- and belowground carbon cycling in tropical forested ecosystems. The Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment (TRACE) in Puerto Rico is the only field warming experiment in the world that integrates both plant and soil warming in a tropical forest, and thus is uniquely positioned to investigate and model the controls and interactions critical to forecasting tropical forest responses to a changing climate. In particular, TRACE has amassed an exceptional dataset of above- and belowground processes and conditions that include identification of the individual and interacting effects of multi-year in situ warming, natural extreme climatic disturbances (e.g., drought, large precipitation events), and associated changes to forest communities and biogeochemical cycles. With the help of TRACE’s long-time modeling partners, the project is ready to incorporate data from multiple facets of TRACE inquiry into a synthetic modeling framework, as well as iteratively collect new data to assess the potential for acclimation over the longer-term as well as advance the understanding and capacity to numerically represent these productive ecosystems. The team will integrate and scale complex above- and belowground processes using ELM, the land component of the DOE Earth System Model (E3SM), coupled with a model that represents vegetation demography (FATES). The effort proposed here enables the synthesis of whole-forest effects of warming and precipitation disturbance, from 1-meter deep in the soil to the tops of the canopy, and to directly address the DOE missions to develop fruitful dialogs between modelers and experimentalists and investigate ecosystem responses, feedbacks, and recovery from extremes events and chronic perturbations. Our ability to accurately represent tropical forests in climate models lags far behind that of many temperate ecosystems and, as a result, they account for numerous large uncertainties and biases in ESMs. We have developed an integrative, hypothesis-driven approach to directly address this large gap in existing state-of-the-art models and to significantly advance our understanding of how tropical forest carbon cycling will respond to global change."
"Exploring global aerosol cloud interactions in unprecedented numerical fidelity by combining breakthroughs in multi-scale modeling, GPU supercomputing & neural network process emulation.",Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023368,"Pritchard, Michael","Michael.Pritchard@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,irvine","['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","M. Pritchard, University of California, Irvine (Principal Investigator) P. Blossey, University of Washington, Seattle P.-L. Ma, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland W. Hannah, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) continue to represent one of the largest uncertainties in climate model projection due to multi-scale simulation challenges. Adequately representing the range of scales of important processes from the detailed kinetics of microphysical droplet nucleation around condensation nuclei, through their complex effects in modifying the spatial organization dynamics of cloud-forming updrafts, to their ultimate macroscale effects is a formidable computational challenge. As such the ACI dynamics simulated by current versions of the DOE’s most state of the art global climate models – including prototypes that resolve 2-4 km horizontal resolution natively -- are unsatisfying. They must rely on assumption-prone parameterizations for unresolved sub-km updraft statistics, which struggle to represent fundamental coherent turbulent spatial structures, as well as on an incomplete representation of the aerosol activation process occurring within these updrafts. We see computational opportunities to address both shortcomings with exciting new technology emerging in DOE’s modeling portfolio. Our approach is two-pronged. The first novel aspect is to run an advanced GPU-compatible version of the E3SM-Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF) at coarse exterior (2-degree) and ultra-fine (< 200-m) interior resolution. MMFs are an interesting class of climate model that copes with the demands of ultra-high horizontal resolution by embedding small micro-domains of explicit fine-scale dynamics within each grid cell of a conventional coarse resolution global climate model. GPUs, or ""graphical processor units,"" are advanced microprocessor chips having interesting computational capabilities especially for highly parallelized calculations such as the embedded cloud-resolving arrays used in MMFs. This simulation approach, also known as “cloud superparameterization” – though not without its own idealizations -- allows a global climate model to capture an unprecedented level of realistic detail in the spectrum of sub-cloud eddies that form low clouds, and which mediate ACI, including a satisfying regime dependence of ACI in the response of raining vs. non-raining cloud, with minimal parameterization assumptions. The second novel aspect of our proposed work is to then exploit the MMF together with modern machine learning methods to build a credible emulator of aerosol activation. Aerosol activation is the process through which small particles such as soot, dust or sea salt mediate the initial formation of cloud droplets that can then grow to become large enough to precipitate; more aerosol tends to distribute liquid water across more droplets, inducing significant changes in the reflectivity of clouds and thus their energetic importance to the climate system. Our improved numerical representation of this nucleation process will be achieved by harvesting our MMF’s high- resolution atmospheric state information to drive millions of computationally expensive “parcel model” calculations – a form of detailed microphysics computation that takes into account non-equilibrium explicit kinetics of transient aerosol activation dynamics that are traditionally neglected. This allows us to build a machine learning “training library” of paired inputs and outputs that we intend to use to develop a neural network parameterization of high-fidelity aerosol activation on the microphysical scale. Outsourcing the costly explicit parcel model calculations to neural networks can dramatically reduce the cost of using them routinely in the global climate model. Thus we will predict aerosol activation in the E3SM-MMF, replacing a traditional Abdul-Razzak scheme that must make considerably more assumptions about aerosol nucleation physics, in a way that can also interact with the MMF's resolved, sub-km eddies to produce modifications of the essential dynamics at the heart of aerosol-cloud interactions, to understand their sensitivity to avoiding traditionally necessary process approximations. The model development aspect of this work exploits a newfound ability generated following several years of sustained investment within the DOE Exascale Computing Project to run MMFs at unprecedented throughput and resolution on GPU-based LCFs. Prototypes of the E3SM-MMF have been proven in concept to achieve impressive throughput for resolutions previously unthinkable. This dramatically reduces the historic barrier to admitting sub-km turbulence on planetary scales and is possible on today’s DOE clusters using E3SM-MMF. Meanwhile, neural network emulators, once trained using automated architecture scans and emerging software to deploy forward inferences within climate simulation code dramatically reduce the computational barrier to the inclusion of explicit aerosol activation kinetics. We will thus construct a customized experimental configuration of the E3SM-MMF climate model having ~1-degree exterior resolution, ~200-m 3D embedded nterior resolution, and modified microphysics including a new high fidelity emulator of aerosol activation. The main science goal will then be to deploy the modeling framework on a suite of nudged- and free-running simulations to shed new light on multi-scale aerosol-cloud interaction dynamics and their water cycle implications at a substantially higher degree of freedom, and lower degree of process approximation, than has previously been possible."

We will introduce a higher level of abstraction at theoperator regressionlevel that can be expressed using deep neural layers, kernels, graphs and spiking neural networks (SNNs), and implemented in the next generation of power-efficient advanced computing architectures. The threepillarsof our research are neural operators, graph networks, and SNNs, with threecross-cutting themeson the mathematics of machine learning, uncertainty quantification (UQ) and trustworthy PIMI, and causal inference. These pillars allow co-design of mathematics and computing hardware to augment foundational understanding and optimal control of complex systems spanning extremely disparate scales, e.g., climate modeling processes, as well as embedded systems and systems-of-systems requiring causal inference and physics-informed modeling. We have assembleda new teamof applied mathematicians, computer scientists, neuroscientists and application scientists aiming to change this paradigm by developing newefficientneural operators for the post-Moore era with PIMI. The goals of SEA-CROGS are to bring rigorous and scalable PIMI to computational science and engineering (CSE) while simultaneously advancing PIMI in a pull-push interaction. Challenges and Three Proposed Research Areas (RAs):Our group has developed the two main pillars of SciML, namely neural PDEs (PINNs) and neural operators (DeepOnet), but significant problems remain related to theory, generalization, efficiency, scalability, and excessive computational cost. To tackle the issues of tremendous resolution demands for climate models, representation and automation of complex systems, and the requirements for low-power and real-time inference in embedded systems, we urgently need aparadigm shift. InRA-I, we will focus on the theory and new algorithmic developments of operator regression networks, including multimodality training, continual learning, multitasking, and hybrid discretization-surrogate formulations.In RA-II, we will develop graph neural and kernel networks for operator regression, and we will deal with causal inference and complexity of multiscale/multiphysics systems at scale. One aspect of the proposed research will be focused on the development of a Computational Graph Completion (CGC) framework for representing, organizing, and reasoning with computational knowledge in analogy with category theory that has served as a mathematical model for breaking up mathematical models into their fundamental pieces analyzed through their functorial relationships. We will also develop a foundational theory for Graph-Informed Neural Networks (GINNs), a hybrid approach combining deep learning with probabilistic graphical models. InRA-III, we will develop physics-informed SNNs and spiking neural operators. The event-driven behavior of SNNs can be efficiently implemented on neuromorphic hardware to yield > 100x magnitude energy efficiency compared to that of conventional deep learning on GPUs. However, no previous works have focused on regression, and training SNNs remains a challenge due to the non-differentiability of the spiking neurons. Management, Dissemination and DEI. SEA-CROGS will organize student and postdoc exchanges, webinars, workshops, summer schools, research-visit exchanges, with significant new activities on recruiting and engaging underrepresented groups, and a close partnership with Spelman College.

Determining Scale-Dependent Shear Strength in the Crust,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023097,"Brodsky, Emily",Emily.Brodsky@theregentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Under the natural loading of the overlying crust, rocks fail in shear. Characterizing and predicting the conditions of failure is key to the sustainability of any subterranean human activity including carbon sequestration, geothermal energy, groundwater management, and oil and gas reservoir management. Much of what we know about the shear failure of rocks has its origins in earthquake physics and geotechnical engineering, where laboratory experiments are commonly performed on centimeter-scale samples. These results are then extrapolated to field settings where failure can occur on kilometer-scale structures. Such extrapolation is potentially problematic given the known scale-dependence of tensile strength, and the presence of geological structures at the relevant scales. Thus, scaling shear stress is a grand challenge in the geosciences with implications for humanity’s ability to meet the most pressing challenges of mitigating global climate change. Here we attack this problem using three approaches: We will capitalize on exhumed fault surfaces as multi-scale archives of the shear strength of rocks. Specifically, we will pursue a hypothesis based on scaling arguments that the aspect ratio of asperities reflects the rock strength. We will use a theory of multi-scale elastoplastic contacts to rigorously determine the relationship between roughness and strength. We will measure the relative abundance of triggered earthquakes as a function of applied stress. We will use both the stresses generated by injection and those generated by other earthquakes as probes of the in situ distribution of stresses required for failure. We will perform laboratory experiments on analog materials to capture the dynamics of fully confined ruptures. The experiments provide insight into the correct interpretation of stress drops and failure stresses for events that only partially break an interface. Most natural events are confined in this sense and the lack of such confinement is one of the most conspicuous issues differentiating centimeter-scale rock mechanics experiments from natural faults. This work combines theoretical, experimental and observational approaches towards a better description of shear strength in the crust at the scale of relevance for earthquakes and other failure events. The proposed work will be performed by postdocs and graduate students at UC Santa Cruz."
Extreme Moist Transport Events as a Driver of Arctic Amplification,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023070,"Feldl, Nicole",Nicole.Feldl@theregentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Extreme Moist Transport Events as a Driver of Arctic Amplification Nicole Feldl, University of California, Santa Cruz (Principal Investigator) Hansi Singh, University of Victoria/Columbia University (Co-Principal Investigator) Philip Rasch, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory/University of Washington (Collaborator) Hailong Wang, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Collaborator) Bryce Harrop, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Collaborator) Poleward moisture transport into the Arctic occurs via short-lived, episodic intrusions of warm, moist air masses. These extreme transport events are associated with an enhanced greenhouse effect that is expected to slow sea-ice growth in winter and hasten the start of spring melt season. Yet, their impact on the Arctic energy balance averaged over longer time scales has been difficult to quantify, in part due to the challenge in separating local and remote Arctic moisture sources. Additionally, though much of the poleward moisture transport into the Arctic occurs via moist intrusions, popular diagnostic frameworks emphasize only a modest contribution of atmospheric energy transport to Arctic amplification. To reconcile these contradictory findings, this project will advance a process-oriented understanding of the role of moist intrusions in driving Arctic warming via pre-conditioning sea ice for rapid ablation during the warm season and therefore initiating positive local feedbacks. Numerical water tracers in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) will be used to quantify how moist intrusions, both at present and in a warmer world, draw moisture from source regions outside the polar cap and inject it over the polar cap. Source-aware radiative locking experiments in E3SM will reveal how moist intrusions and their vertical structure help sustain water vapor and cloud feedbacks over the Arctic, and thereby elicit sea ice retreat and its attendant feedbacks. A multi-model analysis of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) will enable characterization of how jet stream characteristics, such as position and sinuosity, control present-day and future moist-intrusion climatologies. Lastly, biases in model representation of moist intrusions and their impacts will be assessed through a like-for-like application of causal inference techniques, which can establish causality in the absence of targeted model experiments, to E3SM experiments, the CMIP6 ensemble, and reanalysis products. Through the coordinated activities of E3SM experiments and statistical approaches rooted in AI techniques, this project will systematically uncover how the large-scale environment governs the climatology of moist intrusions and how, in aggregate, these extreme transport events drive Arctic summertime sea ice loss and warming across an ensemble of coupled Earth system models."

These control electronics are connected to the quantum circuits using coaxial cables adding to the system thermal noise and increasing the latency of the quantum computations. A cryogenic control panel at <4 K and physically closer to qubits will solve these issues. There are multiple approaches to address the cryogenic logic, but the problem of cryogenic memory remains unsolved. Without a cryogenic memory, ongoing attempts to increase qubits will lead to a “cryogenic memory wall” for quantum systems, where processing will be restricted by the narrow bandwidth afforded by limited co-axial cables. As the United States government and private companies race towards bigger and more practical quantum computers, the importance of quantum system control will become crucial. An efficient cryogenic control panel with non-volatile memory will provide a strategic edge to domestic quantum technologies aiming for the quantum advantage. It is without a doubt that the DOE’s investments in quantum hardware will benefit from a cryogenic non-volatile memory. It will also assist other DOE QIS threads including quantum timing, sensing, and communications as well as high energy physics (HEP) applications. Cerfe Labs spun out from Arm Holdings to commercialize a novel memory technology (CeRAM) based on correlated electron materials. In phase I, Cerfe Labs has demonstrated the first sub-1 K non-volatile memory that is compatible with CMOS processing and meets quantum computers requirements. As a proof of concept, we fabricated CeRAM devices (5 and 10 µm) using spin-on deposition and tested them using DC sweeps as well as microsecond pulses at varying temperatures from 300 K down to 870 mK. As expected from the correlated electron materials physics, the devices showed good performance across the wide temperature range. We successfully operated devices for up to 1000 cycles without damage and retained the memory state for more than 12 hours, exhibiting CeRAM’s non-volatile behavior. In phase II, we plan to optimize the memory for the cryogenic operation including magnetron sputtering for higher quality films that will enable smaller device sizes, lower power and higher speed operations, array development, and packaging suitable for cryogenic temperatures. With initial data from phase II, we plan to engage customers (private and government) in the co-development of cryogenic memory to meet the requirement of specific quantum technologies. At the end of phase II, we will have a fabrication process that will be compatible and can be transferred to the fabrication facility. A successful DOE QIS-focused program allows us to mature our technology at larger dimensions and lower bit counts required by the QIS, and then proceed towards a much higher memory density demanded by commercial applications such as embedded processor memory and stand-alone non-volatile memory. Our first QIS product (phase III) will be a 16 kb memory for storing quantum gate waveforms, addresses, and other control instructions. With continued development, we plan to further increase the cryogenic memory density for implementing error corrections and other advanced quantum algorithms."

Extensive use of commercial cloud computing resources in the scientific community has the potential to lower costs, accelerate research, and enhance collaboration. However, cloud computing utilization is often suboptimal. Users typically overprovision to accommodate potential surges in server use, as well as to ensure that stateful applications, which cannot tolerate any downtime, are not interrupted. To reduce wasteful spending and enable more efficient usage of cloud resources, a technology is being developed that consolidates idle workloads and over-sized software containers to take advantage of deeply discounted server space such as the Spot Market. The technology is a combination of two separate products. The first module spawns containers on discounted VM instances (Spot Instances), and dynamically relocates containers between such instances, based on availability and price. A second technology packs idle containers onto a small number of VMs during the idle period, and relocates containers onto different VMs when workload increases, without any service interruption. This lack of service disruption is a fundamental departure from current market solutions that offer “cloud optimization” requiring manually re-architecting cloud infrastructure with significant downtime during testing and redeployment. In Phase I, live migration of government High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads within a single public cloud was demonstrated. The measured savings were up to 80% as compared to on demand costs, with the same performance (i.e., 5x the amount of compute for the same cost). The ability to do similar migrations with similar value in other public clouds is required to address substantial commercial opportunities and DOE user needs. Also, demonstrating a successful hybrid cloud live migration of workloads between on-premises private cloud to the public cloud could lead to significant cost savings without changing a line of code for the application, presenting a potential approach for migrating to the cloud in an inexpensive and low-risk manner. Finally, successfully establishing the platform to support GPUs could result in a potentially large number of highly compute-intensive DOE applications being run in the spot market of multiple public GovClouds at significant cost savings. During the Phase II award, multi-public cloud support will be developed, hybrid cloud support established, and capabilities extended to GPU processing."

Although iPP and PE constitute nearly two-thirds of the plastic produced worldwide, efforts to recycle them are challenged by their immiscible properties that lead to low- quality blended products. This has led to the investigation of compatibilizers additives, which can be added to such iPP/PE mixtures to improve their structural integrity for future use. However, existing compatibilizers require high additive loadings (5-10 wt%), resulting in plasticization, which deteriorates the physical properties of produced blends and effectively relegates them to limited or downcycling purposes. To overcome the significant challenges associated with recycling PE and iPP from mixed waste streams, Intermix is developing cost-efficient methods to generate novel tapered block copolymers (TPBs) for the compatibilization of PE and iPP, resulting in blends with desired tensile strength characteristics. Enabling upcycling processes, copolymer blocks will be developed to create structures with well-controlled, enhanced properties, even compared to virgin plastics. In Phase I, the team investigated various copolymer block structures, testing them on ocean plastics and demonstrating their strong performance as a compatibilizer for real- world plastic waste. Promisingly, ocean plastics compatibilized with as little as 2 wt% of Intermix’s additive exhibited a strain a break of >800%, as compared to 20% for the un- compatibilized ocean plastic blend and ~1700% for HDPE and ~600% for iPP homopolymers, respectively. Building on the Phase I successes, Intermix’s proposed research will be comprised of three objectives: 1) Development of catalytic system based on chain transfer chemistry, enabling efficient block copolymer synthesis, 2) Investigation of the rheological and impact properties of compatibilized PE/iPP copolymers, informing the development of application-specific compositions, and 3) Production scaleup to multi-kilogram scale, establishing scalability and delivering the compatibilizer volumes needed for pilot testing. Completion of these objectives will establish the commercial feasibility of the technology, demonstrating its processability and scalability and validating its performance in compatibilizing real-world plastic waste. This innovation opens the door for iPP/HDPE blends to be specifically engineered to exhibit desired mechanical properties using the unique characteristics offered by iPP (strength) and HDPE (flexibility), without degrading the resulting blends with high levels of compatibilizer additive. The proposed technology will provide exciting opportunities to recycle the world's top two polymers through simple melt blending, obviating the need for separation and lowering associated costs. Further, the technology will encourage higher recycling rates for these materials while supporting the sustainable production of new materials of equal or increased value, thus addressing critical recycling challenges presented by mixed waste. The successful development and commercialization of this technology will serve to facilitate the transition to a more circular plastics economy, from supplying manufacturers with high-value recycled plastics, to enabling the development of novel polymer materials for specialized applications such as transport, aerospace, and defense."

Chem. Int. Ed. 58, 16390 –16394 (2019)). In particular, the propylene/propane separation performance of LIPS/VPLT ZIF membranes confined (entirely or partially) inside mesopores is remarkably superior to that of most conventional ZIF membranes consisting of unconfined (deposited on the external surface of porous supports) polycrystalline films. However, a fundamental understanding of the factors that lead to such performance is not available. It is hypothesized that the mesoporous support, which serves as the matrix of the selective ZIF component of the membrane, through interfacial interactions plays a vital role in affecting the ZIF structure. The combination of LIPS with VPLT is an essential part of a methodology for testing this hypothesis. This research consists of four interwoven methodological challenges: (i) extension of the LIPS/VPLT methods to create a range of membrane nanostructures; (ii) adsorption isotherm and diffusivity determination using a combination of experiments and mathematical analysis; (iii) structure determination; and (iv) molecular-level understanding using simulations. Task 1 will be performed at JHU (Tsapatsis) to address (i) and (ii) above, while Task 2 will encompass characterization methods (iii) and be accomplished at Brookhaven National Lab and SBU (Boscoboinik). Task 3 focusses on simulations (iv), and it will be performed at UMN (Siepmann). Overall, this research elucidates structural characteristics that are responsible for the high performance of confined ZIF nanocomposites in order to extend the use of LIPS and VPLT to other confined metal organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites."

Water is one of civilization’s fundamental deliverables and is channeled into canals across much of the planet. The planetary water cycle is also accelerating due to the rise in global temperature, putting more water faster into many watersheds. This presents a unique opportunity to generate industrial-scale power within this nexus, while being environmentally benign, and while using existing infrastructure. Canal authorities in America and worldwide have an inherent interest in generating power from slow-moving water on their canal systems, because major benefits accrue to water districts that have been able to develop electrical power. Hydropower generation within water districts provides revenue and jobs primarily in rural areas, while providing power to the national grid. However, there are serious impediments to this development, such as massive civil works, environmental impacts, costs, and regulation. Consequently, most districts opt not to develop their resources. The principle of suction-augmentation represents a transformative approach to efficiently, economically, and sustainably developing this new energy resource. Success of this SBIR project could establish a new energy industry that harvests the vast kinetic energy in civilization’s waterway networks, an untapped segment of the blue economy. In this Phase II research, a newly invented hydrokinetic turbine, which targets the slow and narrow channels of waterways, will be tested, and validated to optimize its ability to harvest this energy. The research will consist of flume testing, numerical studies, and a demonstration project. Potential public benefits are many. Deriving income through more effectively exploiting the power potential of these constructed waterway systems will allow districts to invest to save water, improve water quality, conserve, and improve habitat, protect species, improve waterway and related infrastructure, and better serve the needs of irrigators, which include the need for power for pumps. This will create jobs, support local agricultural economies, while also offering the potential for providing a large volume of carbon-free base load power to the grid."
A Unified Model for Epitaxy of Metastable Crystal Polytypes at the Nanoscale,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023222,"Goldman, Rachel",Rachel.Goldman@regentsoftheuniversityofmichigan,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","A Unified Model for Epitaxy of Metastable Crystal Polytypes at the Nanoscale Rachel S. Goldman, University of Michigan (Principal Investigator) Liang Qi, University of Michigan (co-Investigator) Judith C. Yang, University of Pittsburgh (co-Investigator) Stephen House, University of Pittsburgh (co-Investigator) Interest in nanoscale crystal growth has exploded in recent years due to the extraordinary properties that emerge at the nanometer scale. Since the first demonstration of micro-wire formation in the 1960s, there have been several reports on metal catalyst-based growth of nanowires (NWs) ranging from metals to semiconductors to complex oxides. Generally, liquid metal droplets act as catalysts, which allow gaseous species to be transformed into a nanoscale crystal in the vicinity of the vapor-liquid-solid triple junction. In the case of epitaxy, NW growth often occurs via a self-catalyzed process, in which liquid metal droplets are consumed during the nucleation and/or transformation process. However, for complex materials, the mechanisms for polytype selection at the nanoscale remain elusive. In contrast to bulk systems whose polytype selection is determined by thermodynamics, it has been hypothesized that metastable NW polytype selection is governed by surface/interface energies, surface diffusivities, and/or droplet angles that determine ABC vs. AB stacking of atomic planes, resulting in zincblende (ZB) or wurtzite (WZ) polytypes. For ZB-polytype-preferring materials, such as III-As and III-P, ZB vs. WZ polytype selection has been described by empirical “contact angle” models, enabling the design and fabrication of NW polytype superlattices. However, for GaN, a WZ-polytype preferring material, the “contact angle” models would predict ZB polytype selection, independent of contact angle. Indeed, for WZ-polytype-preferring materials – such as GaN, InN, AlN, and ZnO – an approach for controlled switching between WZ and ZB has yet to be identified. We recently discovered an approach to coax self-catalyzed GaN NWs to form the ZB polytype. In this project, we will build upon these results to determine the underlying fundamental mechanisms for ZB vs. WZ polytype selection during nanoscale epitaxy of WZ-polytype preferring materials. Building upon our findings to date, we aim to move beyond existing empirical models to develop a unified physics-based atomistic model for nanoscale epitaxy of metastable crystal polytypes. Our predictive model will include the effects of surface polarity and other atomistic processes not captured by classical nucleation theory. We will examine WZ-polytype preferring materials, including wide-bandgap semiconductors, InN, AlN, and ZnO, that find energy applications ranging from solid-state lighting to high-power electronics. This project consists of a combined computational-experimental-statistical approach to develop a predictive framework for epitaxy of metastable crystal polytypes in confined geometries. We will use ab initio calculations and atomistic simulations of interfacial structures, energetics, and kinetics to reveal the nucleation/growth mechanisms related to polytype selection and morphological evolution. A feedback loop between atomistic simulations and in situ characterization will be used to predict the growth rates of WZ and ZB polytypes. In another feedback loop, models for polytype selection during nucleation will be verified and improved by machine-learning-aided characterization of NW polytype selection. We explore three main hypotheses: (1) Polytype selection is controlled by WZ vs. ZB nucleation rates in given environments rather than by adatom diffusion, (2) The energy barrier for nucleation of ZB GaN inside liquid Ga droplets or at solid-liquid interfaces is lower than that for WZ III-N at triple-phase junctions. Therefore, the ratio of ZB to WZ III-N nucleation rates may be controlled by Ga (or In)/N flux ratios, growth rates, and temperatures, and (3) An atomistic understanding of WZ vs. ZB nucleation mechanisms in given environments will inform strategies for nanoscale epitaxy of stable/metastable polytypes, heterostructures (WZ/ZB/WZ QDs-in-NWs), and high-precision NW polytype superlattices. This project directly addresses Basic Research Needs for Transformative Manufacturing, with a tightly integrated feedback loop between epitaxy processing (Goldman), theory and modeling (Qi), and machine-learning aided characterization via in situ and ex situ TEM (House, Yang)."

SPARC-X will exploit a recent breakthrough in electronic structure methodologies: systematically improvable, strictly local, orthonormal, discontinuous real-space bases that efficiently and systematically capture the local chemistry of the system. With further adaptation using new machine-learning techniques and the use of the massively parallel Spectral Quadrature (SQ) electronic structure method, the algorithmic complexity and prefactor associated with DFT calculations involving semilocal as well as hybrid functionals will be dramatically reduced. Using petascale computational resources, SPARC-X will enable quantum mechanical simulations at length and time scales previously accessible only by empirical approaches, e.g., 100,000 atoms for a few picoseconds using semilocal functionals or 1,000 atoms for a few nanoseconds using hybrid functionals. Using future exascale resources, the sizes and times targeted are two orders of magnitude larger. Such a capability has applications in a wide variety of chemical sciences, including reactive interfaces where large length- and/or long time-scales are needed and traditional force fields fail. This is particularly important in the dynamics of catalysis, where bond breaking and formation must be understood in detail. This project will develop, test, and apply the SPARC-X framework to understand the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 systems with and without Au co-catalysts for nitrogen transformations. This integrated development and application strategy will ensure that SPARC-X is a robust, efficient, and scalable software package for quantum simulations on current petascale and future exascale computing resources."

Despite decades of research, the generation of H2 from efficient, light-driven water splitting is still a tremendous unmet challenge. The water oxidation half-reaction of water splitting is particularly problematic given its sluggish kinetics and requirement for harsh oxidizing conditions. Our overall vision for this project is to develop, characterize, and optimize systems for aqueous proton reduction to H2 in which the electrons are delivered from a living organism to an H2-forming photocatalyst. This potentially transformative approach provides a route to producing H2 from water that does not rely on water oxidation, while also using sustainable sources of electrons and energy to drive the photochemistry. The central goal of this project is to address fundamental principles that will enable the creation of an entirely new type of system for carbon-neutral hydrogen production. Our systems will make use of the outstanding photocatalytic properties of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, which are established as highly active and robust photocatalysts that yield H2 in a reaction driven by visible light. As opposed to getting electrons needed to complete the photocatalytic cycle from oxidizing water, or delivered from sacrificial molecules, here electrons are delivered from the microbe Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Interfacing microorganisms with nanomaterials is an attractive approach to building systems for artificial photosynthesis that harness the extraordinary properties of both components. Our approach is unique and flexible, in that it leverages extraordinary potential in nanomaterial catalyst development with microbial respiration via extracellular electron transfer. Specific goals for this project include understanding interfaces between nanomaterials and microorganisms, elucidating charge-transfer reactions at bio-nano interfaces, determining the role of microbial nutrients and electron shuttles in charge transfer and hydrogen production in a bio-nano system, and the investigation of factors that limit the durability of hydrogen production activity. The team of PIs on this project brings a synergistic collaboration involving new theory based on data-driven artificial intelligence approaches, innovative development of bio-nano systems for photochemical H2 production, nanomaterials synthesis, photophysical characterization and state-of-the-art spectroscopic imaging, and living material synthesis and biological genetic manipulation. Our proposed research will provide fundamental knowledge to advance hydrogen production using clean energy sources, one of the significant challenges for achieving carbon-neutral hydrogen. This project squarely intersects several priority areas of research for the DOE through the proposed studies of complex bio-nano interfaces, focus on renewable and living systems, and control over relevant photochemical processes. In sum, this project will provide critical and necessary knowledge for preparing next generation carbon-neutral H2 production systems."

This phenomenon was called the Rashomon Effect by Leo Breiman. The set of good models is called the Rashomon Set, and the goal of this project is to locate, store, and study the Rashomon sets for classes of interpretable models, including decision trees and generalized additive models. In a sense, our project changes the paradigm of machine learning from the goal of producing optimal models to the goal of producing all feasible models. Simply put: it often makes little sense to use the single model that was output by a machine learning algorithm when there are many that could have explained the data equally well. Thus, rather than giving the user only the single model output by a machine learning algorithm, our approach gives them a choice. Enabling this choice empowers users the possibility of finding a model that could actually be used in practice. The objective of this project is to find and study the Rashomon sets of various model types, including decision trees and generalized additive models. Specifically, we propose to study variable importance of models in the Rashomon set, robustness of the Rashomon set to changes in the data, and embeddings of different types of Rashomon sets for different loss functions. We also propose methodology for sampling models within the Rashomon set, as well as user interfaces. When the Rashomon set cannot be enumerated, our goal will be instead to create a large polytope inside the Rashomon set for users to explore. Our goal is for users to enjoy exploring the Rashomon set to find models that not only agree with the data, but also agree with intuition and outside knowledge.

Our interdisciplinary team spans the needed expertise in quantum optics theory and experiment and in bioimaging, plant- and micro-biology. A multi-pass microscope interrogates a sample multiple times in a programmable and deterministic fashion. This leads to a metrological advantage for imaging weak scatterers. This enhanced sensitivity can yield a significant reduction in damage imparted to the sample or can reduce image acquisition time. The approach can enter a quantum non-destructive regime. In this regime the photon interaction with the image target is fully coherent, and the imaging process becomes quantum non-destructive when conditioned upon the detection of single photons. Recent theoretical analysis has shown that this imaging approach saturates quantum information bounds and compares favorably with bounds obtained using squeezed and other entangled probe states, but avoids the technical complexity associated with the production of such states. In the proposed work, we seek to demonstrate a scanning confocal multi-pass configuration, enabling dose efficient stimulated Raman imaging. This configuration will enable volumetric, chemically specific, imaging of thick samples. We anticipate Raman sensitivity gains of a factor of ten or more, substantially improving the state-of-the-art."

Fernandes, University of Minnesota (Principal Investigator) Materials that display strong electronic correlations provide a rich platform not only to explore promising technological applications, but also to elucidate how distinct electronic phases of matter interact with each other. In many cases of interest, these electronic states are not independent competing phases, but intertwined quantum orders in which different electronic degrees of freedom are entangled. This gives rise to complex microscopic behaviors and unique macroscopic phenomena whose descriptions remain a major challenge in condensed matter physics. An appealing and concrete realization of the idea of intertwined orders is that of vestigial orders emerging from a primary phase, which provides a natural extension of the concept of liquid crystalline phases to the quantum realm. The overarching goal of this proposal is to substantially advance the understanding of intertwined orders by focusing on their intricate interplay with the degrees of freedom of the underlying lattices that host them. More than just a passive spectator, the lattice degrees of freedom can modify, constrain, and even enable unique collective electronic behavior. Moreover, the recent realization of correlated electronic states in two-dimensional moiré superlattices has shined the spotlight on non-crystalline lattices, whose properties are rather distinct from those of standard crystal lattices. Therefore, progress in understanding intertwined orders requires addressing not only the role of the electron-electron interactions, but also of the electron-lattice interactions in less explored regimes. The innovative aspect of this proposal is its focus on the behavior of intertwined and vestigial orders in both crystalline and non-crystalline elastic media. Promising research directions are identified to shed new light on the entanglement between the intrinsic elastic fluctuations and the collective electronic phenomena of two classes of systems of broad contemporary appeal: electronic liquid crystals and twisted moiré systems. A synergistic effort is also proposed to extend the framework of vestigial electronic orders to novel settings, such as twisted bilayer graphene, and to novel phases, such as condensates of four-electron bound states. In particular, the research program consists of three thrusts of experimental relevance that will be investigated by a battery of complementary theoretical approaches, from field-theoretical methods to classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. These research thrusts focus on the elucidation of the coupling between electronic nematicity and distinct types of elastic excitations on various crystal lattices; the understanding of the impact of the electron-phason coupling on the correlated phenomena displayed by moiré superlattices; and the realization of cascades of vestigial orders emerging from a single mother phase, including little explored charge-4e and spin-tensorial orders. Successful completion of the proposed work will facilitate the discovery of novel electronic phenomena, provide unique insights for the interpretation of contemporary experiments, guide future empirical explorations, and open new paths towards the ultimate goal of controlling and elucidating intertwined states of matter in correlated materials."

Auerbach (Chemistry), Wei Fan (Chemical Engineering) University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 Zeolites represent a major cornerstone of today’s energy industry as the most-used petrochemical catalyst by weight in the world, powered by their size- and shape-selective nanoporous channels and cavities. These fascinating and important materials stand to play an even bigger role in future technologies such as biomass conversion to biofuels and carbon dioxide capture. For those applications, recent research has shown that having largely hydrophobic nanopores with targeted hydrophilic defects can dramatically improve performance. However, designing zeolite syntheses that produce such targeted defect structures remains a grand challenge. Based on discoveries from our previous DOE funding period, we propose herein to examine a “3rd route” to zeolite formation – intermediate between the traditional hydroxide route (which can leave uncontrolled defects) and the fluoride route (which can produce defect-free, all-silica materials) – to yield design criteria for synthesizing all-silica materials with targeted defects using secondary structuredirecting agents (SDAs). Our previous research has also shown that 3rd route zeolite syntheses can accelerate crystallization by as much as a factor of 3 (so far). To expand this 3rd route to other zeolite systems, and to investigate the microscopic factors responsible for accelerated crystallizations, we propose to investigate and answer the following important questions: 1. How can targeted defects be engineered into Si-zeolites during F-mediated synthesis? 2. How can zeolite crystallization kinetics be altered and controlled using secondary SDAs? 3. What relationship exists between tuning defects and crystallization kinetics of zeolites? Answering these questions strongly complements other DOE-BES funded research, such as the Nanoporous Materials Genome Center, which is focused on screening known and hypothetical nanoporous materials for target applications in catalysis, separations, and storage. Such screening does not address the needed design principles for synthesizing target materials. Our research program aims to fill this critical gap in knowledge. Our team possesses unique capabilities in zeolite synthesis, in-situ characterization, molecular simulation, quantum chemistry, and data science — all with a focus on zeolite science. We have designed a tightly integrated research plan to apply this battery of methods towards understanding how utilizing secondary structure-directing agents in 3rd route syntheses can push controlled amounts of positive charge into as-made zeolites, requiring targeted defects to compensate charge. Gaining this understanding requires thorough characterization and complementary ab initio simulation – we have shown in our previous funding period that unprecedented atomic-level insights can be generated through our collaboration. Our proposed innovations in data science to compute Raman spectra, and applying Metadynamics within our Reaction Ensemble Monte Carlo approach for modeling crystallization kinetics will yield powerful and efficient simulation approaches for elucidating the 3rd route to zeolite synthesis. In the end, we will produce (i) new design principles for defect engineering in all-silica zeolites, (ii) new insights on the roles of secondary structure-directing agents for accelerating zeolite crystallization, (iii) new atomic-level knowledge on how using secondary structure-directing agents alters angles and rings in the very early stages of zeolite formation, and (iv) new methods for reducing fluoride levels in all-silica zeolite synthesis, crucial for allowing industrial scale syntheses of important nanoporous materials. And our broadest impact will be enhanced rational design in the fabrication of zeolites for advanced applications in a host of energy-relevant areas."

More specifically, we will assess the usefulness of ZNE under spatially and temporally correlated noise, which are often encountered in real-world scenarios. ZNE has received significant attention in the computing domain, both theoretically and in real experiments using quantum hardware, including quantum simulations of molecular and magnetic systems. Despite its success, the standard operating assumption for ZNE is that the noise is uncorrelated, which is at odds with many recent studies of NISQ devices. Similarly, NISQ-era quantum magnetometry platforms have conveyed evidence of correlated noise environments. In order to reconcile ZNE with realistic noise environments, members of our team have recently shown that quantum control theory frameworks can be exploited to evaluate ZNE in quantum computing applications when subject to correlated noise. It is through this lens of quantum control theory that we will analyze the effect of ZNE on sensing scaling limits (i.e., the standard quantum limit and Heisenberg limit) and transfer insights gained from present-day quantum computing to the application of quantum sensing in noisy environments. We will achieve our objectives by leveraging the filter function formalism (FFF) from quantum control theory to design and evaluate ZNE protocols in the context of DC and AC magnetometry. Within the framework of dynamical error suppression, we will optimize the spatial and temporal resources of our protocols, while maintaining superior sensitivity compared to baseline protocols that do not employ ZNE. The ultimate test of ZNE's effectiveness will derive from a detailed comparison with other techniques for noise suppression in quantum sensing, namely dynamical decoupling and quantum error correction-based approaches. Having identified strengths and weaknesses of each method in the context of correlated noise, we will seek to develop hybrid protocols in which the different techniques work in concert, in order to maximize sensor performance. Our project offers potential impact for a variety of DOE interests. Quantum magnetometers facilitate the development of new measuring techniques for material characterization. For example, defect centers have become a promising technology in recent years for spin chemical potential, electrical transport, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Improving the sensitivity of quantum magnetometers in noisy environments potentially enables improved precision and accuracy in characterization techniques for quantum material design and development. The utility of quantum sensors for high energy physics (HEP) is also being increasingly recognized, including applications involving magnetometry, as explored in our proposal. These developments are witnessed by recent work on axion dark matter detection, either through nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, or through detection of weak AC magnetic fields that are theorized to be produced by axions. These and other HEP examples clearly indicate the value in exploring methodologies for optimizing sensor performance, using ZNE or other error mitigation techniques."

We developed significant domestic in-house manufacturing and chemistry capabilities that have not only allowed us to build high quality factor niobium cavities for quantum computers, but also to machine niobium and niobium-tin parts for novel accelerators for National Laboratories. In Phase I, we optimized the shape of the QWR and improved its geometric factor (proportional to Q-factor) by at least a factor of two. In Phase II we have developed the machining and chemistry techniques in order to improve the surface quality of the resonators, and therefore, their Q-factors. The tests performed in Phase II have demonstrated the increase of Q-factors by about an order of magnitude, and we expect better results in the remaining tests. Our collaborators at the University of Chicago have also developed, built, and tested the transmons that will be integrated into the niobium resonator. In this Phase IIB we propose to continue building-up the SRF capabilities gained through the quantum computer program, with a particular focus on developing and qualifying SRF component deep drawing and electron beam joining procedures, which are a critical need for DOE National Laboratories. In particular, we will revisit the fabrication technology of the cavity from the machining to forming and welding approach. We will make a niobium tube with a smooth interior, weld a cap with a machined inner conductor, and perform quality tests until the quality of the resonator meets industry standards. The results of this project will be the development of essential capabilities of SRF cavity fabrication in order for RadiaBeam to become a leading vendor of SRF products in the USA. As recently reported by DOE’s Snowmass Report, there is a need for high-quality, cost-competitive manufacturing of low to mid volume SRF products. In addition, the emerging discipline of quantum computing, although presently in its infancy, is rapidly growing and has an explosive commercial potential."

At the heart of this process is the semiconductor|liquid junction, whose chemistry and properties are dominated by the identity and structure of atoms at the semiconductor surface. The extent of electronic coupling between surface molecules and the semiconductor determines the band-edge structure and its interaction with the contacted electrolyte solution. Surface molecules with a high extent of electronic coupling exhibit unique electrochemical and physical abilities: efficient electron/hole transport, diffuse and polarizable surface orbitals, strong induced dipoles and conduits for hot-carrier or multi-exciton transfer. However, the underlying design principles regarding how to maximize electronic coupling between semiconductor and molecule remain understudied and underdeveloped. The goal of this work is to learn how to maximize electronic coupling between semiconductor and molecular species covalently attached to the surface. This proposal describes fundamental studies using bulk silicon — Si(111) — as a model semiconductor whose surface will be covalently modified with molecular precision to tune interfacial properties and surface orbital hybridization. We will use chemical modification conjugated acenes attached with different structural modes to test hypotheses regarding how chemical connectivity, orbital symmetry and orbital energy impact semiconductor|molecule electronic coupling. (Photo)Electrochemical tools such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), surface capacitance (C-V), dark and illuminated current-voltage behavior (J-V), solid state contacts (Si|Hg), will be employed to determine the extent of electronic coupling. Additionally, the model photoelectrocatalytic system pSi(111)|R|TiO2|Pt for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) will provide functional outcomes for the selected Si-Acene and Si-Anth-Metal constructs. Photophysical measurements including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), photoluminescence (PL), surface photovoltage (SPV), electronic sum frequency generation (ESFG), surface recombination velocity (SRV), and surface X-ray absorption and fine structure (GI-XAS/XAFS) will aid in confirming molecular attachments and the effect of molecular attachment on silicon band-edge energies as well as band-bending properties in the vacuum condition. Theoretical and Computational approaches will include symmetry-adapted Group Theory MO diagrams to semiconductor|molecule bonding, and DFT calculations to assess molecular contributions to the Si band structure (and vice versa). Through all of the above chemistry, measurements and theory — we will develop a rigorous, orbital-symmetry based approach to reliably predicting the extent of electronic coupling in semiconductor|molecule constructs and their impact on photoelectrochemical efficiencies. Such findings will impact future designs for attachment of molecular catalysts, photosensitizers, electron transfer, and conduits for hot-carriers or multi-excitonic states. The uncovered principles will provide guidelines for tuning other semiconductor materials like Si micro/nanowires, III-V bulk substrates, and II-VI or Si nanocrystals."

The boreal forest is a climatically sensitive ecosystem, and predicting impacts of global change requires identifying and incorporating appropriate drivers into models. To date, the boreal forest ecosystem is not well-represented in large-scale models of the Earth system used to understand and predict carbon allocation and carbon cycling, nor in demographic models of change in forest trees. A key gap in these allocation and regeneration models is the process of tree reproduction. Tree reproduction in boreal ecosystems is an important ecological process to which carbon and nutrients are allocated and it is critical for forest regeneration. Conifer trees dominate the boreal forest, and during years of high tree reproduction, there is an abundant production of reproductive tissues (i.e., cones and seeds). Projecting ecological impacts of climate change on boreal forests requires information on allocation of trees to reproduction (i.e., to seeds and other reproductive tissues) because: i) reproduction is a critical process in tree regeneration, which is key to the fate of future forests, and ii) carbon and nutrients are allocated to reproduction in addition to other processes (e.g., above- and belowground tree growth). Furthermore, the environmental factors that determine allocation to reproduction in trees (temperature, precipitation, nutrient availability and carbon dioxide concentration) are shifting due to global change. The objectives of the project are for the investigator to i) participate in the Department of Energy's Office of Science program in Biological and Environmental Research (BER) training and outreach activities, ii) conduct directed fact-finding on Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division research projects and new partnerships with individuals and groups at National Laboratories, ii) conduct meetings with potential collaborators at National Laboratories to discuss EESSD-relevant research ideas, and iv) to develop a plan for future research efforts. Successful completion of the project objectives will result in collaborations being developed and a plan of action for designing research projects that will create a fusion between empirical observational and experimental data that include tree reproduction with modeling approaches to advance understanding and predict responses of the boreal forest ecosystem to environmental change. This project will enable an investigator with expertise on patterns and drivers of boreal tree reproduction and climate change to engage with the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division in the Department of Energy's Office of Science program in Biological and Environmental Research.

Electron and nuclear spin dynamics play a central role in quantum materials and devices for high-density magnetic memory, spintronics, quantum sensing, and quantum computing. All these applications require stable and controllable spin-based systems, and therefore, a detailed understanding of the factors affecting electron and nuclear spin dynamics. Spin relaxation is responsible for the loss of magnetization in high-density memory applications, while spin decoherence is related to the loss of quantum information in qubits used in quantum sensing and computing. Spin-based molecular systems are ideal for fundamental studies of spin relaxation and decoherence, and valuable for practical quantum information science (QIS) applications because they are structurally well-defined and amenable to synthetic design and scale-up. The goals of this EPSCoR Implementation project are to (1) develop the design guidelines for spin-based molecular systems for QIS applications using state-of-the-art theoretical and experimental techniques; and (2) train the future QIS workforce for the State of Nevada and the DOE National Laboratories. This project will develop a comprehensive understanding of the contributions from different interactions (spin-vibration, hyperfine, spin-orbit and magnetic exchange) to the quantum dynamics of spin relaxation and decoherence in molecular systems. The research objectives are to 1) synthesize and characterize structurally controllable lanthanide (Ln) complexes, transition metal (TM) complexes and nanographenes (NGs) with interesting magnetic and magneto-optical properties to study spin dynamics; and 2) elucidate the role of different spin relaxation and decoherence mechanisms, and determine the design elements that will allow control of these mechanisms for QIS applications. Theory and computations will predict the structure and vibrational spectra of these molecular systems in the gas, solution, and crystal phases; calculate the energies of spin states and spin-vibrational and hyperfine couplings; and model the spin dynamics using the effective Hamiltonian approach and generalized quantum master equations to predict the spin relaxation and decoherence times. Experiments will focus on the synthesis and characterization of the same spin-based molecular systems. The electron spin relaxation and decoherence will be studied using the magnetometry and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques, while spin-vibrational couplings will be probed with advanced 2D spectroscopies. The experimentally obtained structures, energy spectra and couplings, as well as spin relaxation and decoherence times will be used to validate the theory, while theoretical predictions will guide the development of new molecular systems with improved magnetic, magneto-optical, and quantum information storage and processing properties. This project will lead to a holistic understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and spin dynamics by elucidating the temperature dependence of various contributions to spin relaxation and decoherence mechanisms in different environments. This knowledge will pave the way for the development of stable and controllable spin systems amenable to synthetic design and scale-up, critical for future applications in QIS. The project will train the future QIS workforce for the State of Nevada and the DOE National Laboratories by 1) strengthening the collaborations between University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), Argonne National Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory through the PI’s, co-PIs’, postdocs’ and graduate students’ visits to these National Laboratories; 2) developing a multidisciplinary course in Quantum Information Science, co-taught by the project’s investigators; and 3) expanding UNR’s interdisciplinary Chemical Physics Graduate Program to include the Department of Chemical & Materials Engineering."
Novel Approaches to Eliminating Thermally Induced Birefringence in High Average-Power Laser Amplifiers,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0021856,"Offermann, Dustin","Dustin.Offermann@vossscientific,llc","['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Novel Approaches to Eliminating Thermally Induced Birefringence in High Average-Power Laser Amplifiers-Voss Scientific, LLC, 418 Washington SE, Albuquerque, NM 87108 Offermann, Dustin, Principal Investigator, dustino@vosssci.com Voss, Donald, Business Official, donv@vosssci.com Amount: $1,149,999 The development of high average-power lasers is fundamentally challenged by the onset of thermally induced birefringence in typical gain media. This depolarization caused by birefringence is spatially dependent and difficult to correct. The result is a significant loss of energy and beam uniformity. The best-known solutions for this problem involve paired numbers of passes through identically stressed gain media with some means of rotating the beam polarization 90-degrees, wholesale. The subsequent pass will then undo the effects of the prior pass with varying degrees of success. This is not always feasible given the cost and complexity of adding amplifier stages and/or the costs (or even existence) of the optics required to rotate the polarization. Other solutions include changing the gain configuration so that the thermal stresses are along the axis of the gain instead of radially. This translates to not using cylindrical rod amplifiers and forgoing the many design and efficiency benefits associated with rods. The novel solution proposed here is the implementation of phase retarder plates which uses a custom fabricated meta-surface to convert linearly polarized light into radially or azimuthally polarized light, and then back again. The thermally induced birefringent axes of YAG and glass-based amplifier rods are in the radial and azimuthal direction. Thus, such a change in polarization would prevent the laser from seeing the birefringence and eliminate the depolarization effect. During the Phase I, Voss Scientific demonstrated fabrication of nanostructures which showed a high degree of polarization control. Depolarization mitigation using radially polarized light was also demonstrated using a lower-power- handling, commercial phase retarder as a surrogate for the meta-surface phase retarder. Meta-surfaces fabricated using silicon were tested for their laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) which was found to be less than 200 mJ/cm2 for 1-ns pulses at 1064 nm. Alternative materials to silicon were identified and also tested for LIDT which exceeded 1.5 J/cm2. During the Phase II project, the meta-surface will be redesigned and optimized using the new materials. Fabrication techniques using silicon should be directly transferable. The goal of the Phase II project is the demonstration of a laser system that uses the meta-surface phase retarder. The successful demonstration of the technology proposed will enable the drastic reduction in size, complexity, and cost of high average-power lasers and just as importantly, greatly improve beam quality. Furthermore, mechanism by which the meta-surface works to mitigate birefringence works independent of changes in the magnitude of the thermal birefringence in the gain. In principle, the meta-surface optics can be scaled to very large apertures, making them uniquely suitable for use in high energy (>100 J) lasers, like those sought by the DOE. A broad range of potential applications for such lasers exist, including hadron therapy, isotope production, and inertial fusion energy."

However, fusion research and development is still limited by steep production costs, long-lead times, and the difficulty of machining scroll vacuum pumps from stainless-steel. Stainless-steel is universally recognized as the only reliable means to contain radioactive T in fusion vacuum trains but little research has been conducted to evaluate the performance and permeability of alternative T handling materials that could significantly reduce capital cost, shorten development schedule, and simplify the adoption and commercialization of fusion reactor components. This SBIR proposes to conduct a T containment performance and permeability study to evaluate the effectiveness of safe T handling utilizing easily machined aluminum plated with nickel or other elements to replace state-of-the-art stainless-steel T containment. The project intends to show that alternative plated aluminum can maintain the same impermeability of stainless-steel throughout the expected lifetime of T handling components while maintaining or improving performance. Five test aluminum test sample coupons were manufactured at Air Squared’s Colorado Headquarters and tested for added adhesion, hardness, surface finish, thickness, plating buildup, and flatness. Then, two scroll vacuum pumps were fabricated and plated to be tested for their vacuum performance in a magnetic fusion tritiated environment in Phase II. In Phase II, Air Squared will evaluate additional methods of reducing costs, manufacturing lead times, and weigh of plated aluminum scroll roughing vacuum pumps while also increasing the T pump’s performance. Air Squared is confident that evaluating the performance and permeability of stainless-steel T containment alternatives will significantly reduce capital cost, shorten development schedules, and simplify commercialization of future nuclear fusion components. Verifying inexpensive, easily machined materials can safely handle radioactive working fluids will appreciably lower economic barriers to entry for and accelerate nuclear fusion research. Scroll vacuum pumps adapted with successfully evaluated materials after Phase II could be universally adopted and replace stainless-steel pumps worldwide at over sixty nuclear fusion research institutions."

For example, among the important chalcogenide-based systems (those containing sulfur, selenium and/or tellurium), CuIn1-xGaxSe2 (CIGS) serves as the absorber in commercialized thin-film solar cells, Ge2Sb2Te5 functions as the active media in mass-produced phase-change memory and optical disks, Bi2-xSbxTe3 underlies high-performance thermoelectric devices, and AgGaS2 represents an important non-linear optical material. Substantial contemporary fundamental research also focuses on these systems—for example, Cu2ZnSnS4 and related chemical systems are heavily pursued because of the prospects of replacing CIGS as an active photovoltaic absorber material with non-toxic and earth-abundant analogs (i.e., to reduce reliance on a constrained indium supply). A previous version of the program focused on a particular emerging class of tunable multinary chalcogenides based on a I2-II-IV-VI4 stoichiometry (I, II, IV and VI refer to elements in the named columns of the periodic table), to develop underlying structural and chemical design rules for these systems and to understand how the resulting crystal structures impact properties, particularly those that relate to more effective solar energy application. The current program uses a synergistic combination of computational and experimental tools to build upon this research base, targeting a broader array of structure-property relationships. Specific goals for the program include extending the range of chemical systems that can be predicted and understood by the design rules developed previously, focusing on using these design rules to allow for an increased range of relevant property tunability (e.g., particularly targeting control of the bandgaps and concentrations of electrical carriers in the semiconductors), and extending the program’s property focus to physical phenomena that rely on structural distortions and symmetry breaking (e.g., such properties underlie spin control and emerging low-power spintronic applications for computing). Accomplishment of these goals will provide foundational new understanding of the materials chemistry in an important chalcogenide-based semiconductor family, for which emerging application opportunities have already been envisioned. Additionally, the program seeks to effectively mentor and train undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers in the broad area of energy materials design, using an interdisciplinary and integrated approach incorporating synthesis, experiment and theory."

The new technology will provide compact string inverters for utility-scale photovoltaic farms having higher power ratings and higher power density, with a path to reduced cost and increased U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. The technology can contribute to grid reliability and will reduce the balance of system costs. DC-DC conversion to add dc-coupled battery storage to our revolutionary SiC solar string inverter technology is proposed. The add-on cost of the power electronics battery interface will be decreased from the current 4¢/W commercial state-of-the art to 1¢/W. This 4x reduction in capital cost will be achieved via our proprietary high-frequency SiC composite architecture technology and through integration of the dc-dc converter and dc-ac inverter functions into a single unit. The project will demonstrate full power prototype battery interfaces integrated into our inverters and will support ongoing certification efforts. In the Phase II project, we have demonstrated increased output power (200 kW per MPPT zone, and 400 kW for the two-zone system) without significant increases in cost or size; this decreases our high-volume price to below $0.035/W and increases our power density to over 8 kW/kg. This significant advancement was achieved through further optimization of the magnetics, power stage design, and improved thermal management system. These demonstrated cost, power density, and power rating metrics significantly beat the commercial state of the art, and we believe they can be achieved with US manufacturing. The impact of BREK technology on the market is demonstrated by our signed licensing and development agreement with Yaskawa Solectria Solar to develop a 500-kW solar inverter to their specifications, based on the results of this SBIR project. Inverters will be fully manufactured in the U.S. BREK also has a signed licensing and development agreement with Emporia Energy to develop a bidirectional EV charger, based on the BREK core SiC inverter technology. To date, we have raised $750k in seed funding from Angel investors and the State of Colorado. We have received feedback from potential customers, leading to two primary recommendations: (1) obtain UL certification and begin product testing at customer sites, and (2) incorporate dc-side battery storage into the string inverter product. Hence, in Phase IIB, we propose to add SiC-based dc-dc conversion with bidirectional power flow to integrate battery storage interface functionality. In addition, we will extend our grid support functionality to meet the IEEE 1547 (2018) standard. These customer-driven changes, combined with IEEE/UL certifications, will enable BREK to fully commercialize this technology.

Abundant availability of feedstock has led to industrialization of production. A significant cost-limiting factor to utilize cellulosic nanomaterials is dewatering/drying, “as cellulosic nanomaterials are not economical to ship long distances containing significant water content”. This represents a critical driver for increased costs of nanocellulose products. This program utilizes electrochemical based dewatering system and process to dewater cellulosic nanomaterials while maintaining material properties when dried and re-dispersed. This program will design, scale, and transition an electrochemical-based dewatering system and integrate with traditional drying technology to achieve low-cost and energy-efficient dewatering/drying of cellulosic nanomaterials. The projected environmental impact and energy costs of electro-dewatering and drying is considerably less than drying alone or traditional dewatering technologies plus drying for cellulosic nanomaterials. Developed and scaled an energy-efficient (70% reduction in energy requirements compared to thermal dewatering), environmentally beneficial (51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions), economical (31% reduction in cost/ton of dried material), and industrially viable electrochemical based dewatering approach to process up to 2 tons/year of dried nanocellulose at alpha- scale. The approach is capable of achieving >50wt.% final solids and 18 wt.% final solids, that could be rehydrated under vortex and confirmed for re-dispersibility. Material properties (structure, particle size) were maintained by the dewatered cellulosic nanomaterials. Transition the Phase II alpha-scale apparatus to a beta-scale system to process at least 20 tons/year of dried cellulose, integrate with a drying process, and install this integrated system at commercial biorefinery facility. The Phase II alpha-scale system will be used to evaluate cellulosic materials from multiple manufacturers. Phase IIB will conclude with a design for a gamma-scale system with the potential to process 200+ tons/year of dried cellulosic materials. TEA/LCA from Phase II will be updated and transition strategies will be developed for future full-scale implementation in Phase III and beyond. Benefits from an electrochemical technology for dewatering cellulosic nanomaterials include: (1) development of renewable materials; (2) increasing nanocellulose use in applications such as oil, gas, wastewater treatment; (3) reductions in cost and energy consumption; (4) progress toward sustainability. Innovation in nanocellulose separations will be beneficial for traditional industries such as paper production.

SOLUTION NMR FROM SINGLE-ATOM QUANTUM-SENSING TECHNOLOGY,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-FG02-05ER15693,"Casey, William","William.Casey@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,davis","['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Geochemists are intensely interested in the properties of aqueous solutions at elevated temperatures and pressures but determining the properties of aqueous solutions at extreme conditions is challenging. Models of aqueous solution chemistry are generally limited to pressures less than 0.5 GPa. We invented a method to extend Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments to 3-4 GPa of pressure, corresponding roughly to the bottom of the Earth's deepest crust, but extending the pressure range further will be difficult using the current technology. Our goals are to detect the NMR signals from solutes dissolved in water at elevated temperatures and pressures. Volume has traditionally been the problem. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) usually acquires signals from use of magnetic induction and Faraday coils. This detection method requires a large number of molecules with polarized spins because polarization is relatively inefficient; expensive superconducting magnets are required. Typical sample volumes for aqueous solutes is 0.01-2.0 milliliters, which are difficult to place under pressure in a spectrometer. Thus NMR research at high pressures and temperatures usually examines low pressures if a piston-cylinder apparatus is used, or only examines bulk materials if a diamond-anvil apparatus is used. Piston-cylinder technology can reach 3-4 GPa. Diamond-anvils can reach dozens of GPa, but only for very small samples of nanoliters or less. These volumes are too small to detect aqueous solutes using conventional NMR spectrometers; thus most work using such anvils focuses on bulk samples (e.g., neat alcohol) and not the solutes dissolved in the solvent. A new method of NMR detection could revolutionize spectroscopy on aqueous solutions of geochemical interest and derives from research on quantum information technology. Rather than employ powerful magnets and Faraday coils, the method uses the light released from single-atom defects in diamonds to give information about spin states and magnetic fields. The defects consist of a nitrogen atom coupled to a vacancy. One subclass attracts an additional unpaired electron so that the defect has a net negative charge and two unpaired electrons. These are referred to as N-V(-) centers. The unpaired electrons can exist in either paired or spin-polarized states and splitting of the spin-polarized states depends sensitively on relatively small magnetic fields. Electrons can be excited to the spin-polarized states with microwave radiation. Furthermore, the spin states can be excited by inexpensive laser light (532 nm) to excited states that preserve the ground-state spin populations. Decay of the excited-state populations, however, proceed via different pathways depending upon whether the electron spins are polarized or not. Thus the intensity of the red light that is released by the excited electrons contains information about their ground-state spin populations. Strategies exist to use the modulated intensities to yield information about nearby magnetism, including nuclear magnetism from nearby solutes in aqueous solutions. The promise of this new technology is elimination of superconducting magnets and large sample volumes for NMR spectroscopy on aqueous solutions of geochemical interest. Volumes could be reduced to nanoliters or less, which allows the method to be adapted to diamond-anvil technologies. Importantly, the volumes are now so small that previous inaccessible solutes could be studied, including radioactive materials that would be dangerous in large volumes. We propose to build a prototype instrument and demonstrate it on geochemically important nuclei. We think that this research, if successful, will transform geochemistry by making experiments up to dozens of GPa on aqueous solutions possible and by reducing the volumes to less than nanoliters. Our objectives are: (1) Construction and demonstration of an NMR spectrometer based upon the modulated light released by these excited N-V(-) defects. (2) Adaptation to a diamond-anvil cell using microwave antenna embedded in the diamond. (3) Establishment an array of NMR methods on aqueous solutions. This research expands the very type of research accessible to aqueous geochemists and allows testing of key predictions about the solution chemistry of fluids in the Earth. This goal fits into the needs identified in Basic Research Needs for Geosciences: Facilitating 21st Century Energy Systems of a confident ability to predict chemical reactivities. It also addresses the overarching goal of DOE/OBES research to: 'control reactivities at the scale of atoms and electrons'."

Such applications are multi-scale in the sense that quantities of interest that we seek to measure at the macroscopic scale are strongly driven by effects at much smaller/shorter scales. While the enormous multi-decade national investment in massively parallel computational resources has had a transformational impact on fields as diverse as aircraft development, the understanding of complex biological processes, subsurface reservoir management, and weather predictions, many of the plasma-driven problems of critical importance remain computationally intractable due to their multi-scale character. This center is motivated by the need to develop accurate long-term modeling of plasma systems for fusion energy and national security that are suitable for optimization and uncertainty quantification at the engineering scale. Plasma-mediated thermonuclear fusion (the subject of a recent Summit at the White House) promises clean energy that is environmentally responsible, which is essential to the survival of the human race and the health of the planet. Thermonuclear fusion also plays an important role in National Security. Developing the mathematical and computational capabilities to address such currently intractable multi-scale problems in plasma science will provide us a means to truly impact both clean energy and national security realms and will make accessible new opportunities to leverage the unique behaviors of plasmas for other engineering applications. Led by Michigan State University and Los Alamos National Laboratory, CHaRMET brings together national leaders from five universities and four national labs in the mathematical modeling of plasmas. The center seeks to build a first-of-its-kind holistic approach that will exploit structure within models to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and to bridge a wide range of length and time scales in plasma science. The curse of dimensionality is a critical challenge that is pervasive throughout computational science and refers to the observation that the resources needed to solve a problem on a computer scale exponentially with the dimension of the problem. Fundamental plasma models are seven dimensional and are presently computationally intractable (with existing mathematical methods and computational resources) to drive optimization and uncertainty quantification at the engineering scale of plasma systems. The CHaRMNET team will take a holistic approach based on (1) a synergistic theoretical and data-driven approach to hierarchical modeling, including a wide range of surrogates; (2) next-generation multi-resolution, mixed-model algorithms that provide a self-adaptive structure in terms of the methods and the models; and (3) structure and asymptotic preserving algorithms that enforce model consistency throughout the model hierarchy. A key component will be a comprehensive characterization of error and uncertainty that will enable automated model selection in addition to facilitating robust design, control, and decision making."

(1) To develop a proto-type high resolution (<1 km) version of the root-zone soil moisture product called SoilMERGE or SMERGE. (2) To characterize the biogeography and biodiversity Southern Great Plains reptiles and amphibians. These two objectives are linked as root zone soil moisture is a critical climate variable that has a more direct influence on plant growth than precipitation. Therefore, the developed downscaled version of SMERGE can be used as input for modeling biodiversity. Development of downscaled SMERGE will be facilitated Department of Energy (DOE) resources specifically data from the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) facility and modeling platforms such as the Energy Exascale Earth System Model. Methods to be Employed To facilitate downscaling of SMERGE, advanced machine learning algorithms will be applied and tested for accuracy. Our proposed approach incorporates independent variables that are both static (soil texture, elevation, aspect, slope) and dynamic (Normalized Vegetation Difference Index). Downscaled SMERGE will be validated using several approaches including comparison with in situ soil moisture data from ARM and model data from Model (E3SM). Reptile and amphibian biodiversity will be evaluated by comparison of models results with field collected data available via citizen science platforms and museum databases. Modeling will be used to construct the potential current distribution of reptile and amphibian species. Project Impact This project will have multiple impacts. It will serve as a catalysis for faculty research at Texas A&M International University (TAMIU) in areas of biological and environment research of interest to DOE. As such, this effort will build a bridge facilitating access for TAMIU faculty to DOE facilities. In addition, since TAMIU has an 89% Hispanic student body, most of which are both first-generation and low-income. Therefore, this project will very likely involve Hispanic students and hence broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the STEM fields. Thus, this effort will serve as a pipeline to recruit Hispanic students into STEM careers of interest to the DOE. Note that Texas A&M International University has not received DOE Biological and Environmental (BER) funding in the last seven years."

Our goal is to make NCAT the largest producer of African American Atmospheric Chemists/Physicists in the Nation by expanding sustainable research collaboration and professional network for NCAT faculty and students not only with R1 institutions but with Department of Energy Facilities to complement the current research by aerosol scientists and facilities at Center for Aerosol-gas Forensics Experiments (CAFÉ) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and participation in field measurements supported DOE’s Atmospheric System Research (ASR) and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) programs. One of the research priorities in a 2016 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on the future of atmospheric chemistry includes “quantifying trends in emissions from different regions of the world and their impacts on atmospheric composition and chemistry over scales from local to global and developing reliable approaches to integrating top down and bottom-up results for emission inventories.” The research in our group deals with particulate matter and gaseous emissions from biomass fuels native to Africa- a region not well studied. But air pollution impacts everyone no matter where one lives. The work in our group looks at detailed characterization the chemical composition and their light absorbing and scattering properties to be able to understand their impact on health and climate. The collaboration through this grant with LANL will allow us to use more advanced instrumentation to complement and validate measurements in our NCAT laboratory. This work has the potential for important societal impact, in part because wildfires are increasing in intensity and severity in many places. Furthermore (1) This project will directly increase the number of minorities trained in the field of atmospheric science by providing the opportunity for HBCU students to be trained in a state-of-the-art research facility field work and participate in aircraft observations and satellite observations.

Economic conditions across the United States are also placing greater strain on farmers and rural communities. The costs of farming are accelerating rapidly, and farmers need new ways to diversify their revenue. This proposal presents a plan to address these issues for farmers while increasing the availability of renewable energy by developing a commercially competitive photovoltaic solar tracker system optimized for deployments on commercial farms. Agricultural photovoltaics, or “agrivoltaics,” refers to the placement of agriculture and solar photovoltaic infrastructure on the same piece of land. The co-location of agriculture and photovoltaic solar is a symbiotic relationship where both the solar panels and the crops each help the other achieve higher performance. Our proposed agrivoltaics tracking system will provide several benefits for farmer communities, including diversification of revenues streams, protection from severe weather, reduced water usage, and better quality and productivity of crops. The proposed agrivoltaics tracking system will also reduce barriers for farmer communities to access clean renewable energy without having to sacrifice valuable farmland for a single use: energy generation. Through this Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project, VesprSolar will develop a photovoltaic tracker system that is optimized for agrivoltaics but meets the cost structure necessary for utility-scale adoption. This project will be completed in partnership with the University of Oklahoma and will explore radically innovative approaches to reduce the construction costs associated with materials and labor. Based on the principles of modularity and platform design, the agrivoltaics tracker developed will be a highly reconfigurable solution that can be adapted to a wider variety of crop requirements and site conditions, while maintaining high system performance. To date, much of the innovation in agrivoltaics structures today is occurring outside of the United States by companies and research institutions in China, Japan, Germany, and Italy. Very little intellectual property in the field of agrivoltaics structures has been developed by American companies and research institutions. This research presents an opportunity for the United States to establish itself as a leader in the global solar racking market for agrivoltaics and, more broadly, in multi-use integrated photovoltaic systems. The workplan for this research project involves several design iterations, conducting of a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis and Design for Manufacturing analysis, a number of sub-system level tests, analyses of supply chain and manufacturing processes, and a real-scale pilot test with a fully functional agricultural tracking prototype. In addition to the benefits to the farmer and the renewable energy sector, we believe that successful commercialization of this technology would result in 500+ jobs, resulting in $336 million in tax revenue for the federal government over the first 10 years of commercialization. Further, this research will create opportunities for the entire PV solar value chain (EPCs, Utility Companies) serving rural communities."

Securing these plants is an on-going expense that typically accounts for 7-12% of the total cost of power generation. Furthermore, research suggests that 20% of the entire workforce is comprised of physical security related personnel. To ensure that future nuclear energy production from advanced reactors is affordable, safe, and secure, new methods should be examined to optimize security using a realistic representation of the adversary’s ability to perform tasks in a combat environment. During SBIR Phase I, research was completed into integration methods for the Risk Informed Timeline (RIT) software and the data it produces. In support of this research, limited scope performance testing was conducted at an NRC-licensee to collect the necessary experimental data and develop distributions of probability of success for a specific breaching technique employed at exercises frequently across multiple NRC-licensee sites. These experimental random distributions were used to generate data files using the RIT software that were ingested into a prototype plugin module for use in a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) combat simulation. To illustrate the value of this data and prototype, the modeling and simulation tool was used to generate security metrics and a comparison was made for several attack scenarios from one of the NRC-licensees. To support this preliminary study, simulation results were compared for a set of attack scenarios where in one case the conservative assumption that all breaches succeeded 100% of the time and in the other the risk informed method applied random distributions to determine the likelihood of success for each of the relevant breaches. Additionally, a variant of each of the related scenarios was created that included reduced protective force posts. The results indicate there was a positive impact to the security system effectiveness and a reduction in the depth of penetration into the security layers that was measurable even for defensive strategies with fewer officers and thus lower operational costs. Phase II will focus on creating a production-quality and commercialized plugin module that works with the existing COTS modeling and simulation tool suite. Additionally, the RIT approach will be expanded from one task type in the prototype to include several more types of player tasks and actions in the COTS tool suite. This module will allow for industry specific performance data to be incorporated as a library of task times and probabilities of success. A commercialization of this tool, in combination with the COTS combat simulation, will allow existing and advanced reactor designers to develop a security strategy that is based upon realistic performance data for complex tasks that will likely result in lower operating costs."

The realization and sustainment of this type of advanced plasma scenarios in NSTX-U will demand robust integrated control of a large number of plasma properties, which include the shape of the plasma spatial profiles. In particular, active control of the current profile, together with appropriate rotation and pressure profile control, has been demonstrated to be a key condition for the realization and sustainment of high- confinement, MHD-stable, steady-state scenarios. The control of the plasma spatial profiles arises as one of the most challenging control problems in tokamaks due to the high dimensionality and nonlinearity exhibited by high-performance plasmas. A model-based approach emerges as the only possible way of tackling this challenging, nonlinear, high-dimensional, control-design problem, while enabling model-based scenario planning, real-time estimation, control integration, actuator sharing, and real-time optimization. The Lehigh University (LU) Plasma Control Group (PCG) has pioneered many control-oriented modeling and control-design techniques for advanced scenario control, strongly impacting not only the domestic programs but also major experiments around the world. The long-term research goal of the LU-PCG is to contribute from academia to the development and sustainment of disruption-free, high-performance, steady-state, advanced plasma scenarios in present tokamaks as a major pre-requisite for both ITER and prospective tokamak-based fusion power reactors. This goal is fulfilled by (i) developing both physics-oriented and control-oriented predictive dynamic models, (ii) introducing advanced control techniques as tools to elucidate the physics of fusion plasmas and to enable fusion power generation, (iii) developing fusion-driven control theory, (iv) supporting the work in this area at the U.S. fusion experimental facilities, (v) providing the expertise developed here in the U.S. to international tokamaks through collaboration agreements, the International Tokamak Physics Activity, and the ITER Scientist Fellow Network. The overall objective of this project, which is well aligned with LU-PCG’s long-term goal, is to continue and extend LU-PCG’s work on integration of physics and operation in NSTX-U, with the ultimate goals of developing control solutions to enable the realization of advanced scenarios, increasing the physics productivity of experimental time by providing improved and expanded control capabilities, and contributing to the resolution of important physics issues related to advanced burning plasmas. By building both on the long history of collaboration between LU-PCG and NSTX-U and on LU-PCG’s expertise arising from present and past work on model-based scenario optimization and control at different devices around the world (e.g., DIII-D, EAST, KSTAR, ITER), the work plan will focus on the following research priorities at NSTX-U: (1) Further development and validation of the Multi-Mode Model (MMM) anomalous-transport code; (2) Incorporation of enhanced version of MMM into PPPL’s TRANSP code to tackle several key physics research tasks; (3) Refinement and extension of control-oriented plasma-response models to enhance the prediction capabilities of LU’s Control-Oriented Transport SIMulator (COTSIM); (4) Model-based curation of diagnostic data for effective real-time reconstruction of those plasma properties needed for control and forecasting; (5) Development of integrated profile/scalar feedforward+feedback control schemes via off-line and on-line model-based optimization; (6) Coupling of COTSIM with MHD equilibrium solver to enable studies on integrated profile/scalar and shape/position control; (7) Coupling of COTSIM with reduced model of the scrape-off-layer and divertor regions to enable design of active control schemes for simultaneously attaining high-performance core-plasma conditions and safe divertor operation."

The lubricants, either oils or greases, aid in reducing friction, dissipating heat, prevent oxidation, and sealing of water and debris from vital areas of the equipment. During operation, equipment may be submerged or otherwise come in contact with water, posing a risk of the lubricant leaking into a sensitive environment. Development of a high-performance, bio-based, biodegradable, non-toxic, and non-bioaccumulating lubricant for use in hydropower facilities would significantly reduce the environmental risk posed by an otherwise green power generation technology. The objective of this DOE Phase IIB SBIR program is the commercialization of esterified propoxylated glycerol (EPG) as bioderived, biodegradable, non-toxic and non-bioaccumulating base oils and as sustainable, environmentally acceptable lubricants (EALs) for hydroelectric powerhouse applications such as turbine oils, hydraulic fluids, gear oils, and greases. There is a critical need for EALs with improved performance and pricing comparable to traditional oils so that operators can demonstrate good environmental stewardship and comply with impending government regulations. The purpose of the Phase II SBIR research program was to optimize and validate esterified propoxylated glycerol (EPG) composition(s) developed under the Phase I SBIR program as an EAL ISO VG 68 turbine oil formulations. The Phase II research program was successful as Tetramer was able to demonstrate that the performance of fully formulated EPG lubricant is better than the petroleum-based industry gold standard. Additionally, Tetramer produced about 600 kg of formulated EPG lubricant and shipped it to the EU for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) turbine rig test. The fully formulated EPG lubricant exceeded the performance standards under extreme conditions. Currently, 750,000 gallon/year production capacity has been demonstrated. During the proposed Phase IIB program, Tetramer will refine and validate the value proposition of the EPG EALs through performance tests to include efficiency claims in the value proposition. To extend the EPG lubricants market footprint, turbine OEM approvals will be sought. In addition, switch over from mineral oils to EALs will be de-risked by extensively testing of seal, paint, and other oil compatibility, such as used oils, inside the turbines. Beyond hydropower, the development of bioderived, biodegradable, non-toxic, and non- bioaccumulating base oils and sustainable, environmentally acceptable lubricants (EALs) has the potential to impact multiple applications and commercial uses including marine lubricants, process oils, industrial lubricants, and automotive lubricants."

The addition of carbon capture to these plants will significantly reduce carbon emissions, but the process requires energy and increases the electricity cost by 32 percent to 73 percent, depending on the type of plant. If carbon emissions could be greatly reduced from these plants, at low cost, this would represent a significant contribution to improving air and water quality, and the Department of Energy&rsquo;s goals of reducing capital costs of plant upgrades and enabling affordable capture would be supported. The Proposer and Subcontractor are collaborating on the proposed project, to develop a Compact Rapid Cycling Carbon Dioxide Capture system, for capturing pre combustion Carbon Dioxide. Under the Phase II effort, the process was designed into a power plant stream. The full scale system design was scaled down to a prototype reactor design, fabricated and tested, which included a capturing and releasing Carbon Dioxide cycle on one side, while transferring the needed and released heat to the power plant simulated stream, on the other side. By testing the prototype, which simulated a portion of the power plant, the results were relevant to the plant of interest, and were used to update the economic model, better defining the process cost. Under the Phase IIB project, a full scale prototype system will be designed and scaled down to a prototype, for proving tests. The prototype will be fabricated and wash coated with the Subcontractor&rsquo;s proven Molecular Basket Sorbents which, under the project, will be improved for optimum capture and wash coating. The prototype will be tested on simulated pre-combustion syngas, consistent with the syngas composition of the relevant power plants. The test data and technical and economic analyses will be used to produce a Techno Economic Analysis, of the plant, incorporating the proposed system. The major benefit from the successful execution of the proposed work, and the follow on commercialization of the proposed system, would be the reduction in net Carbon Dioxide emissions. Because of the low operating temperatures and the low heat of desorption, as compared to the baseline case in the solicitation, the proposed system can reduce the increase in the Cost of Electricity associated with carbon capture by 36 percent, resulting in a reduction of the Cost of Electricity by 9 percent. These initial estimates will be updated with a Techno Economic Analysis, to demonstrate the proposed system potential contribution to the DOE/Fossil Energy performance goals of Carbon Dioxide capture with 95 percent Carbon Dioxide purity, at a Cost of Electricity 30 percent less than baseline capture approaches."

More recently, a different class of compounds called “quantum materials” has emerged, where unique quantum interactions between the components produce specific and unusual behaviors such as topological insulation, unusual superconductivity, and transparency of electrical conductors. This project focuses on understanding the main concepts needed for a basic understanding of the doping phenomenology and indeed peculiarities in quantum materials from the perspective of condensed matter theory, with the hope of forging bridges to the chemists that have enabled the synthesis of some of the most interesting compounds in this field. A bottleneck in understanding such and other doping behaviors is that the conventional theoretical approach to doping quantum matter tacitly assumes that one could shift the Fermi energy at will without allowing the structure and electronic properties of doped solid to respond to this significant perturbation. In other words, most textbook description and indeed theoretical models of fee electrons in quantum materials assume “unreactive doping”. Such theories rarely predict different charge states (donor, acceptor) but focus on charge neutral doping (indeed, an oxymoron). The underlying problem is that host crystals are not “electronically rigid”, but instead are capable of rearranging structurally in response to introduction of carriers. Such “self-regulating responses” include the formation of localized or extended polarons, the appearance of an intrinsic Fermi level pinning energy, or destabilization of the crystal structure by doping. The proposed research allows for such effects. Here we use the “modern theory of doping” developed in the previous funding cycles that predicts the doping energy levels, polarons, and charge states, transition energies, along with a complete assessment of the response of the thermodynamics of the doped system. We have previously shown that a correct density functional description of some of the classic Mott insulators - ABO3 oxides with B=3d atom do possess band gaps, in contrast with previous expectations. We will take advantage of this important development; now that band gaps are present, we will use both the Density Functional Theory approach, as well as various extensions based on new functionals, combined with the modern theory of doping to elucidate the fundamental physics of doping quantum materials. The explorations are: (a) understand the chemical trends in dopability of ABO3 across the Periodic Table; (b) topological insulation induced by doping (BaBiO3); (c) spontaneous defect formation in quantum materials that have their Fermi level inside the valence band (Ba4Bi3); (d) doping of ABO3 compounds according to our determination of the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum band edges, being either d-d (“Mott”), or p-d, or d-p or p-s orbitals. These studies will establish new textbook knowledge on dopability of quantum matter."

The City’s challenges in responding to flooding events in real-time was brought into sharp focus in 2021 by the devastating results of Tropical Storm Henri and then Hurricane Ida. NYC experiences flooding events from excessive rainfall from storms nearly every year, and sometimes multiple times in the same year. It would benefit, in both financial and human terms, from better predictions for the areas most vulnerable to flooding for any storm event. The City is also concerned about combined sewer overflows because of their effect on water quality and recreational uses. Hence, it seeks to incorporate the best available information about the current and future extreme rainfall events. Understanding the scenarios that properly represent likely storm paths over the City and the associated space-time patterns of rainfall can help improve the operation and performance of hydrologic systems. The traditional design storm-based approach is inadequate for such spatial network simulations. As such, the proposed research seeks to develop a methodology to design extreme rainfall event scenarios considering changing large-scale climate patterns for informing spatial risk in the Greater New York City area. Furthermore, more robust knowledge of correlated extreme events and the resultant simultaneous infrastructure vulnerabilities can support the emergency management division, and will likely create more effective early warning information systems. The research questions that will be addressed are: (a) how space-time distributions of rainfall intensity for extreme rainfall events can best be estimated using multiple sources of rainfall, climate, and storms data; and (b) how these rainfall fields can best be used to assess risks of failure across a network of infrastructure systems. Precipitation estimates from numerical weather and climate models can have significant biases and not resolve the spatial scales relevant for urban flood hazard assessment. However, they resolve the large-scale features of moisture transport associated with the events of concern. In essence, the models capture the larger-scale feature of mesoscale convective systems, but not the fine details. The project will leverage these aspects of the climate models to develop a physics-informed stochastic approach that improves the specificity and accuracy of precipitation associated with future extreme rainfall events. The PIs at The City College of New York (CCNY) will collaborate with the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) scientists.

"Numerical Investigation of Fluid Flow and Space Charge in Liquid Argon Time Projection
Chamber (LArTPC) Detectors",Office of High Energy Physics,DE-SC0023125,"Tu, Shuang",Shuang.Tu@jacksonstateuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Numerical Investigation of Fluid Flow and Space Charge in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) Detectors Shuang Z. Tu, Jackson State University (Principal Investigator) The primary particle detection technology currently employed is the liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC). An LArTPC contains a volume of highly purified liquid argon in a strong electric field. Positive ions resulting from ionization and negative ions resulting from electron-impurity attachment drift slowly at the speed comparable to the fluid flow speed. Local ion accumulation in the active volume of the LArTPC causes distortions of the electric potential from its nominal form, which further causes drifting electrons to arrive at different places on the anode plane than they would had there been no distortions. Therefore, we need to first solve the LAr flow equations to obtain the accurate fluid velocity distribution and determine the ion distribution which can be used to calibrate the electric field afterwards. This proposed project is to continue and expand the work the PI started at Fermilab when he participated in the DOE Visiting Faculty Program (VFP) in the summer of 2021. The objectives of this work are to numerically investigate: the charge buildup inside LArTPCs using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package. the space charge effect on the detector's electric field. To achieve these objectives, we will develop a reliable computational tool that is able to solve for the flow velocity distribution inside the LArTPC, solve for the space charge distribution in the flow field and calculate the distorted electric field accurately and efficiently. In this project, our approaches will address the validity of some assumptions and simplifications made in previous simulations conducted by other researchers, hoping to achieve more accurate results. Our proposed work is summarized as follows: The new development will be based on the PI’s in-house hybrid finite volume/finite element incompressible flow solver. The gaseous argon ullage region will be included in the computational domain. A liquid argon vaporization model will be used to account for the phase change across the interface. The geometric modeling will include some structures previously omitted (such as the corrugations on cryostat walls and the frames holding the cathode plates). Models will be investigated to account for the electron-ion recombination, electron-impurity attachment and ion-ion mutual neutralization in the transport equation of space charges. A parallel electrostatic potential equation solver will be developed based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The electrostatic Poisson equation will be coupled with the space charge transport equation within a physical time step. Investigations will also be conducted regarding whether the flow can reach a steady state and whether the electric force on the fluid is negligible. The developed computational tool will be verified and validated by comparing numerical results with available ProtoDUNE-SP data. Adjustments in simulation parameters and boundary conditions can be made to reduce the discrepancy. The outcome of this project will be a computational software package that will be able to accomplish the aforementioned project objectives. Once verified and validated, the developed computational tool can be used by scientific community to study and understand the dynamics of the complex liquid argon flow, charge buildup and space charge effect in any surface LArTPCs such as SBND, ICARUS and DUNE Near Detectors, provided that the medium properties and detector geometries are known. It is hoped the work to be completed in this project will be valuable in improving the design and performance of such surface LArTPCs and make contributions in the future neutrino experiments."
CHEERS Accelerating the DOE Home Energy Score in California and the U.S.,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0023121,"Hodgson, Jim",Jim.Hodgson@consol,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","CHEERS Accelerating the DOE Home Energy ScoreTM in California and the U.S.-ConSol Home Energy Efficiency Rating Services, Inc., 1610 R Street, Suite 200, SACRAMENTO, CA 95811 Hodgson, Jim, Principal Investigator, jhodgson@cheers.org Hodgson, Jim, Business Official, jhodgson@cheers.org Amount: $199,983 Statement of the problem or situation that is being addressed in your application. The DOE and its national laboratories developed the Home Energy Score™ (HES) to encourage homeowners to improve their energy performance, lower costs and to share energy information through the MLS listing, appraisal, and financing channels. While the HES is an instrumental tool, it is currently underutilized and consists of technical, structural and sector barriers which need to be addressed in order to scale and many energy efficiency contractors are understandably overwhelmed by the added time and effort and lack of incentive to sell and deliver deep retrofit projects while simultaneously meeting the DOE HES program requirements; consequently, contractors may decide to forgo participation. Home Energy Rating System (HERS) Raters have the opportunity to play the critical Assessor role in producing a Home Energy Score (HES); this role has immense potential but currently is unfulfilled. Lastly, while utilities are interested in their customer base achieving greater energy efficiency, especially to help offset growing residential loads in states like California that are accelerating electrification, utilities do not have access to the market actors who are on the front line of influence to homeowners or review and approve their permits: HERS Raters, assessors, contractors and building departments. General statement of how this problem is being addressed: ConSol will integrate the Home Energy Score™ (HES) to its State of California, approved home energy rating services (HERS) platform (CHEERS) to develop a single tool for contractors nationwide to assess, record and install recommended cost, energy, and emissions saving measures to the 140 million single-family homes throughout the U.S. and 14 million homes in California (CHEERS+HES). The CHEERS high fidelity energy code permitting data will be integrated with HES for simple, accurate, easy-to-use home energy estimation and analysis and will directly gain access to the retrofit and renovations markets with the same upgraded platform. This innovative project will assist the utilities in supporting existing homes in their jurisdictions with HES and develop measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions. How is this problem being addressed? What is the overall project approach? In effort to expand the Home Energy Score™ (HES) by increasing the use of aggregable home energy asset data, ConSol proposes to integrate the DOE HES via Application Programming Interface (API) to its State of California approved home energy rating services platform (CHEERS). Once the CHEERS platform and HES are integrated (CHEERS+HES), this enhanced platform will be instantly available and actively deployed via Phase 1 pilot to HERS Raters, assessors and contractors in California to market-test the solution, understand the rate of adoption and identify opportunities for improvement prior to scaling nationally. The CHEERS high fidelity energy code permitting data will be integrated with HES for simple, accurate, easy-to-use home energy estimation and analysis and will directly gain access to the retrofit and renovations markets with the same upgraded platform. This innovative project will assist the building industry and homeowners with an easy-to-use assessment if energy and carbon impacts of existing homes, and assist the utilities in supporting existing homes in their jurisdictions with HES to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions. What is to be done in Phase I? During Phase I of this proposed project, ConSol will (1) design software architecture that links CHEERS to the Home Energy ScoreTM via API, (2) solicit partnership from one or more California utilities for a regional pilot, (3) test the new software with its HERS Raters and contractor network in the partnership utility jurisdiction, (4) launch a pilot version of the newly developed software with HERS Raters and contractors in the utility territory, and (5) explore California’s GoGreen energy efficiency homeowner lending program in parallel with the pilot. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits. Summarize the future applications or public benefits if the project is carried over into Phase II or Phase III and beyond. The CHEERS+HES commercialized product will be ready for national market scale following a successful Phase 1 performance. The CHEERS+HES adoption is estimated to reach a 5% adoption growth rate versus the 110,000 baseline, starting in Year 1 after Phase I completion, and continuing each year. As a direct benefit to the DOE, CHEERS will set a goal of 100,000 Home Energy Score assessments for existing home alterations within the first 10 years following Phase 1 performance. The technical benefits of this proposed project include the harmonized, automated, and seamless integration of the DOE HES into the widely used and market leading California energy registry, CHEERS. The social benefits include the aggregate energy, cost and GHG savings by allowing the broader public streamlined access to the CHEERS+HES measurement and the energy efficiency recommended measures that may result."
STEEP-CF: Storm Treatment Effects on Ecosystem Processes of Coastal Forests,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023099,"Vargas, Rodrigo",Rodrigo.Vargas@universityofdelaware,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Coastal forests and other coastal ecosystems are influenced by complex hydro-biogeochemical processes that are heavily impacted by climate change. Increased frequency and intensity of storm events and sea-level rise (SLR), already occurring and predicted to accelerate due to climate change, affect biogeochemical processes that ultimately shape ecosystem resiliency and can push these ecosystems into an alternative stable state. The result is that areas of coastal forests worldwide are transitioning from upland to wetland leaving behind “ghost forests” with an evident decline in aboveground carbon (C). That said, how these disturbances will affect less evident ecosystem processes, such as belowground C dynamics, is unclear. This lack of understanding is due to relatively less research on belowground processes, particularly at the ecosystem-scale, and the complex interplay between multiple biogeochemical pathways affected by altered hydrodynamics. We propose to improve integrated understanding and predictive capacity of ecosystem changes, feedbacks, and subsequent responses to different types of flood disturbances in coastal forests. Our overarching objective is to improve the understanding and process-based modeling of complex feedbacks between flooding events and soil C dynamics in a coastal temperate forest. We will use field and mesocosm experiments to improve biogeochemical modeling of flooding events in coastal temperate forests using a Model Experimental (ModEx) approach. We will take advantage of the ongoing DOE-funded TEMPEST (Terrestrial Ecosystem Manipulation to Probe the Effects of Storm Treatments), a large-scale manipulation experiment that has been established (but treatments have not started) to test flood disturbances of brackish and freshwater pulse events in a temperate coastal forest. We will additionally provide mechanistic understanding of the processes affected by these disturbance events by performing controlled mesocosm experiments on large intact soil columns obtained from the field site, where flooding events can be carefully manipulated and monitored. We will follow a ModEx approach, testing two different, cutting-edge biogeochemical models (one with emphasis on soil organic carbon (SOC) and the other on methanotrophs) to inform the coupled field-mesocosm experiments that will provide insights for future model refinement. We will address four knowledge gaps and four associated hypotheses. The knowledge gaps include: a) Feedbacks between hydrologic disturbance events & belowground processes; b) Mineral-mediated C release after flooding disturbances; c) Successive hydrologic disturbance impacts on soil CO2 and CH4 flux magnitudes and metabolic pathways; and d) Limitations of soil biogeochemical models under flooding scenarios. We will test our hypotheses on these knowledge gaps in our field and mesocosm experiments with a diverse array of techniques such as: automated measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes and stable isotopes, characterization of organo-mineral associations using NEXAFS-STXM at DOE synchrotron light sources, and using the Millennial model to simulate SOC, and the Soil Methanotrophy Model with respect to soil CH4 dynamics. We will follow a ModEx approach where information of current model assumptions will be used to define the methods and experiments, and then information from our experiments will be used to refine the models as part of the ModEx framework."

The costs of supporting a remotely located ocean observing platform are prohibitively high due to travel time to, and frequency with which, they require battery recharge and data download. Buoys that rely on solar power to charge the batteries are limited by low cloud cover, daylight, and high latitudes. Hybrid power generating approaches, such as designs that utilize liquid propane are also duration limited. The use of wind turbines on buoys creates sizing and stability issues, and, they tend to self destruct if they contact the ocean surface. They fluctuate in temperature significantly and are difficult to protect from water ingress over time. This project will develop a high-power density, commercially viable, compact, and lightweight WEC for powering end-user ocean observing instrumentation. Phase two will consist of the design, sub-system manufacture and testing, power take-of hardware-in-the-loop testing, revision, hull manufacturing, assembly, ocean deployment and testing of an instrumentation buoy. The proposed system will be of interest to scientists and regulators who desire to utilize it to characterize the environmental impacts of MHK devices in general, as well as general Ocean Observing tasks. Examples include pre-large scale WEC deployment site monitoring, ocean environment monitoring, tsunami warning systems, NAVY and DoD ocean sensing systems."
Applications of Nickelate perovskites for neuromorphic computing from electronic  structure and Machine Learning,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021375,"Romero, Aldo",Aldo.Romero@westvirginiauniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Applications of Nickelate perovskites for neuromorphic computing from electronic structure and Machine Learning Aldo Humberto Romero, West Virginia University (Principal Investigator) Subramanian Sankaranarayanan, Argonne National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) While the limit of Moore's law is presently being reached with current microelectronic technologies, we need to develop new paradigms that overcome this limitation. In that respect, neuromorphic computing is a concept that emulates the neural behavior and response of the human brain, and it has been recognized as a promising alternative approach. In this research project, we will perform multi-fidelity scale bridging to explore the potential use of materials with metal to insulator transition for neuromorphic applications. In particular, rare-earth nickelates are promising for such purposes, as the transition in these materials is quite sensitive to a broad set of different external stimuli. Our multi-fidelity approach will bridge the high-fidelity electronic structure calculations with classical potentials. We will bridge dynamical mean field theory with a classical atomistic representation via a deep learning force field. The neural network is trained with energies, charges, and forces obtained by accurate electronic structure theories based on Dynamical Mean Field Theory. The configurational space is generated from known crystal phases, ab initio molecular dynamics with exchange-correlation functionals corrected with the Hubbard model, disordered phases with different concentrations of oxygen vacancies, and nonsymmetrical positions and induced strain by grain interfaces or contact with a substrate. Strategies to train the model with a reduced number of training examples are obtained from active learning methods, and new structures for improving the learning process are generated by using machine learning autoencoders. This classical potential will be validated through a diversity of electronic structure methods and represents an important step to combine the flexibility and accuracy of first-principles electronic structure methods with the speed of classical potentials. The generated multi-fidelity surrogate model will be used to understand the role of strain, oxygen vacancies, proton doping, the variation of the crystal phase, substrate effects, vibrational effects as the octahedral rotation, grain boundaries and defect effects on the response of a Metal to Insulator Transition (MIT) in correlated materials. Long-time and large-scale simulations will help understand the role of different stimuli to control the hysteresis of the MIT, as it has been experimentally suggested. Selected configurations will be analyzed with higher-level theories to provide an accurate electronic description and to study how the orbitals and charges are rearranged under different conditions."
"A Multimetallic Approach to Dinitrogen Reduction, Ammonia Oxidation, and C-N Bond Formation",Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019179,"Thomas, Christine",Christine.Thomas@theohiostateuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","As scientists strive to find sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, ammonia has begun to receive attention as a carbon-free fuel that can be produced from naturally abundant chemical feedstocks (dinitrogen and hydrogen derived from water splitting). Ammonia is produced as a fertilizer industrially on a massive scale using the well-established Haber-Bosch process, but to realize a carbon-free fuel cycle, catalytic processes for the production of ammonia on-demand using milder conditions are required. Furthermore, to harness the energy stored in the N-H bonds of ammonia, catalysts that can oxidize ammonia to dinitrogen must be developed and this is a burgeoning area of interest among catalysis researchers. The proposed project will address both of these challenges using well-defined early/late heterobimetallic complexes to explore fundamental mechanistic aspects of both dinitrogen reduction and ammonia oxidation. Exploring the interaction of well-defined multimetallic complexes with dinitrogen provides a model for the multimetallic interaction and cleavage of N-N bonds by the catalytically active Fe(111) surface in the Haber-Bosch process and the FeMo-cofactor of nitrogenase enzymes. Along these lines, we propose to study the binding and activation of N2 using heterobimetallic complexes in which both metals play a role in binding N2. Catalytic N2 reduction and silylation will be investigated and stoichiometric reactions with these well-defined molecular systems will be used to isolate and identify key intermediates in the N2 activation/functionalization process to elucidate the role of metal-metal cooperativity. The oxidation of ammonia to dinitrogen involves the cleavage of six N-H bonds, and the N-H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) of ammonia has been shown to decrease substantially upon binding to transition metals. N-H bond cleavage can be accomplished via sequential reduction/protonation steps or hydrogen atom abstraction reactions and in a monometallic complex this involves the deprotonation of a metal-bound NHx fragment and oxidation of the NHx-bound transition metal center. In a multimetallic scenario, such as might be at play in a heterogeneous catalyst, the metal bound directly to the NHx fragment may not necessarily be the site of oxidation. We aim to use well-defined heterobimetallic complexes to probe this phenomenon by sterically protecting a redox-active metal center such that substrate binding can only occur at the second redox-inactive metal site. Thus, hydrogen atom abstraction from a H3N-M/M' complex requires proton and electron loss from two distinct sites in the molecule. A series of HxN-M/M' will be synthesized and the N-H BDFEs in these compounds will be determined experimentally by measuring the redox potentials and pKa’s of the complexes. These studies will allow us to probe the effect of a pendent “redox-active metalloligand” on N-H BDFEs and determine whether such a cooperative bimetallic approach has utility in the design of catalysts in the growing field of ammonia oxidation. Lastly, we propose to capitalize on the abundance of dinitrogen as a feedstock for the construction of C-N bonds in organic molecules directly from hydrocarbons via coupling C-H activation and N2 activation processes. Heterobimetallic complexes have been shown to both bind dinitrogen and activate C-H bonds. We propose to combine these two processes by developing methods to promote insertion of nitrogen into the metal-carbon bonds generated upon C-H activation. Both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions will be screened using bimetallic complexes and both organic and metal-containing products will be identified and characterized."

Goodenough and Arumugam Manthiram Project Title: Materials and Interfacial Chemistry for Next-Generation Electrical Energy Storage This project represents a collaborative scientific effort at the University of Texas at Austin to perform basic science research necessary for the realization of sustainable, ambient-temperature rechargeable sodium-based batteries at an affordable cost. Building on our prior work, the project focuses on fundamental materials research on the major cell components of sodium-based batteries, including cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, and their respective interfaces. The project involves an integrated approach encompassing innovative materials design, novel chemical synthesis and processing, advanced materials characterization, and in-depth electrochemical analysis. Specifically, structural, chemical, surface, and interfacial aspects of the materials involved are investigated. Cathode materials capable of delivering high energy densities, including insertion-reaction oxides, sulfur, organosulfur, and organic polymers, are pursued for sodium-based batteries. Although the insertion-reaction layered sodium transition-metal oxides are at the forefront of cathode development, complex issues related to their structural, chemical, thermal, and air instabilities are hampering their practical viability. This project aims to systematically investigate the factors causing the instabilities and overcome the challenges. For example, single-crystal layered oxides are pursued to reduce surface area, particle cracking, and aggressive reaction with the electrolyte. To develop sustainable, low-cost materials without the need for mining, abundantly available sulfur and organic polymers are pursued as cathodes. With sulfur, three-dimensional hosts are designed to enhance active material loading, and in-situ integrated catalyst-sulfur hybrids are investigated to enhance sulfur redox and suppress polysulfide shuttling. Also, localized high-concentration electrolytes are explored to form unique solvation structures and thereby alter the complex sulfur chemistry dynamics from a dissolution–precipitation process to a quasi-solid state conversion regime. The viability of sodium-based batteries depends on our ability to plate and strip sodium metal reversibly and safely over a large number of cycles without the formation and growth of sodium dendrites. Building on the understanding gained with lithium-metal systems through prior support, this project focuses on the development and fundamental understanding of different classes of solid electrolytes with tailored compositions, structures, and functions. To elucidate the challenges involved, the investigation includes the following: (i) glassy and glass-ceramic composite solid electrolyte separators with tailored composition and microstructure to allow for densified monolithic solid electrolytes and to suppress the formation and growth of sodium-metal dendrites; (ii) polymer-ceramic composite electrolytes to enable safe, fast charging with good interfacial contact; (iii) bilayer composite electrolytes for the operation of solid-state batteries based on a sodium-metal anode; and (iv) heterogeneous multilayered polymer-ceramic composite solid electrolytes with a broad electrochemical stability window. Even with many decades of concerted basic science research, the complexities and underlying theories associated with the interfacial chemistry of lithium-based batteries are still evolving. In comparison, sodium-based batteries are in their infancy, with far less information available on their degradation mechanisms and interfacial structures. The project will employ a suite of advanced characterization methodologies, with the developed electrode materials and solid or liquid electrolytes, to obtain the necessary in-depth basic science information needed to understand the interfacial challenges and make the sodium-based batteries competitively viable. The project provides broad training to students and postdoctoral fellows in materials design, characterization, and interfacial chemistry, with a keen attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The essential knowledge gained through this project addresses the following BES Grand Challenge with a broad impact in clean energy storage: How do remarkable properties of matter emerge from complex correlations of the atomic or electronic constituents and how can we control these properties?"

Wood forming cells in trees include fibers, which directly influence the biochemical makeup of wood, and these biochemical characteristics affect the ability to convert wood into bioenergy products. Other wood cell types include water conducting cells, which influence the transport of water and fast growth under permissive conditions, and the ability to withstand water stress during times of drought. Currently, our ability to manipulate wood formation for improved conversion to bioenergy is limited by our understanding of the fundamental processes underlying wood formation. This is because the relevant tissues and cell types lie beneath layers of outer and inner bark, and so are too deep for direct visualization using traditional microscopy methods. To address fundamental biological questions related to differentiation of wood-forming cells, cell wall biosynthesis, metabolic processes, signaling, and transport of materials within and among living cells, novel methods for accessing these cell types are required. Here, we propose to address this accessibility problem by developing and testing two powerful microscopy techniques. These methods will allow direct live-cell imaging of wood-forming cells deep within wood forming tissues. We will develop two different types of implantable imaging probes that will allow direct visualization of wood forming cells. One implantable probe is a cannula (cannula microscopy), a minimally invasive technique whereby an ultra-thin optical probe is inserted into the target tissue; the probe sends excitation light to target cells and retrieves fluorescence signals. The emitted fluorescence will be interpreted using hyperspectral imaging, which in other systems has been demonstrated to provide an unprecedented ability to resolve structures and molecular features at scales ranging from biochemical processes to multi-cellular tissue structures. A machine-learning based image-processing algorithm will convert the spatially scrambled fluorescent signals into images comparable to that of a traditional epifluorescence microscope. The second approach is a miniscope, which is an entirely miniaturized microscope that will be implanted under the tree's bark. This system's strengths are its flexible lens configurations, which will allow optimization for a variety of fields of view and resolutions, and the possibility of providing long-term imaging in remote field locations. Both implantable imaging probes will be fully tested for impact on the vascular cambium and wood differentiation. These microscopy approaches will be tested by applying them to the following problems: (1) analysis of lignification and imaging of lignin precursors; (2) vessel element differentiation, and the impact of abscisic acid levels on vessel cell properties; (3) fiber development in both tension wood and under normal conditions. The development and application of these new microscopy approaches alongside fundamental wood biology analyses will result in optimized resolution, field of view, and through persistent imaging of the same cells, provide novel insights into essential processes of wood formation that influence the resiliency of growth under suboptimal conditions and the cellular features that influence biomass energy conversion properties in poplar trees."

Ajoy, University of California, Berkeley (Principal Investigator) B. Gilbert, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) The bacteria and fungi which live on plant roots and in the surrounding soil constitute diverse, complex communities called rhizospheres. Many rhizosphere interactions are mutualistic, and some are essential to plant health. Recent studies have shown that plants may recruit bacteria and fungi to their roots by exuding nutrients for the microorganisms. The ability to determine causal relationships between root exudation, rhizosphere processes such as nutrient cycling, and plant health is critical to DOE bioenergy goals. Recently developed fabricated ecosystems (EcoFABs) enable researchers to reproducibly prepare root systems for characterization of plant and microbe responses to variable conditions. However, current classical bioimaging and ""exometabolomics"" techniques cannot provide adequate information on the location, timing, and chemistry of root exudates even in these engineered environments, and understanding the movement and interactions of nutrients has remained challenging. For example, analysis via liquid chromatography paired with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) requires rhizosphere metabolite samples to be moved ex-situ and destroyed, has poor spatial resolution, and provides data for only one instant in the rhizosphere’s evolution over time. In this project, we will implement emerging quantum-enabled sensors in diamond to perform chemical measurements in the rhizosphere via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to overcome current limitations in bioimaging. We will develop a prototype ""diamond quantum microscope"" which will interface with an EcoFAB to enable NMR measurement and imaging which detects and quantifies rhizosphere metabolites in-situ and non-destructively, with micrometer spatial resolution and sub-second temporal resolution. The imaging itself can be performed over wide fields-of-view (mm-cm), and continuously over hours-long periods. We will validate the performance of this microscope, and test guiding hypotheses, by comparing NMR measurements of metabolite identity and concentration to mass spectrometry measurements in EcoFABs. We will divide these goals into three thrusts: First, we will implement NMR measurement at low magnetic field via arrays of planar diamond single crystals incorporated into EcoFABs. Second, we will implement NMR measurement at high magnetic fields (yielding high chemical resolution) via diamond nanoparticles dispersed in the root system. Third, following validation of NMR-based metabolite tracking against mass spectrometry data, we will apply the two NMR measurement methods to infer root exudate functions based on chemistry, location, and timing. In particular, we will approach the topic of biochemical adaptation strategies under phosphorus nutrient limitation in switchgrass model systems. Our hypothesis-driven goals are (1) to discern whether different root exudates exhibit distinct temporal patterns and radial/lateral distributions that correlate with, and are vital to, rhizosphere function, and (2) to unravel how under conditions of P-limitation and the presence of low-solubility inorganic phosphate, switchgrass optimally directs carbon resources to P-mobilization. Thus, beyond our technique development aims of surpassing current limits of sensitivity and spatial resolution in bioimaging, we also seek to test the concept that a complex set of root exudates can be classified into ensembles sharing a function or interaction, based on their temporal and spatial patterns. Our team brings a strong track-record and diverse expertise in diamond-based quantum sensing of geochemicals, optically detected NMR, EcoFAB design, and characterization of the rhizosphere."

In the Colorado River Basin alone, mountain watersheds provide the primary water source for more than 40 million people. Accurately representing interactions among vegetation, terrain, and the hydrological cycle in mountain zones remains one of the critical unsolved challenges in integrated Earth system modeling. The complex topography and subsurface heterogeneity constrain water flow paths to produce hydrological heterogeneity that is currently not well represented in land-surface or hydrological models. In forested watersheds, trees mediate ecohydrological processes via physiological controls on water use and drought tolerance, but also via tree size, density and species composition, which alter precipitation interception and water retention. Therefore, plants respond and contribute to hydrological heterogeneity in ways that are only very recently integrated into some land surface models. This project aims to improve understanding and spatially explicit 3D prediction of tree-mediated water and energy fluxes and subsurface flow that together regulate ecohydrologic function in a forested subalpine watershed. Four hypotheses will be tested: Rooting depth and stem capacitance, more so than other hydraulic traits, explain the differences in diurnal and seasonal transpiration patterns and in growth sensitivity to climate across the dominant species in subalpine watersheds. Across forest stands, soil moisture, canopy water content, transpiration, and radial growth covary and depend on non-linear interactions between stand density, species dominance, and topographic setting. The highest canopy water content and transpiration rates are expected in broadleaf tree-dominated forest stands. Interannual differences in forest stand-scale soil moisture, canopy water content, transpiration, and growth are smallest in more convergent, high-elevation topographic positions with low incident solar radiation. Interannual differences are expected to be largest in convergent zones with high incident radiation, where maximum transpiration and the potential range of fluxes is very high. Forest structure and composition have little influence on seasonal soil moisture and transpiration dynamics at more convergent landscape positions where subsurface lateral flow contributions are higher, but have stronger influence on these dynamics in more divergent and neutral positions, particularly during periods of drought. The research approach integrates field measurements of tree hydraulic traits, transpiration, canopy water content, tree ring-width variation, and soil moisture; airborne observations of transpiration and canopy water content; and coupled 3D hydrologic-vegetation demographic modeling using ParFlow-ELM-FATES across a heterogeneous watershed in the Upper Colorado River basin. The project will partner with DOE’s field-based Watershed Function SFA and the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, hydrologic model developers at PNNL, and DOE’s computational facilities to achieve project goals. Project data will be archived in DOE’s ESS-DIVE archive."

Energy density breakthroughs would enable more efficient utilization of intermittent renewable sources (wind and solar) and the production of improved electric vehicles (rapid charge and extended range). While this transition is anticipated to bring enormous societal and environmental benefits, current Li-ion battery technology has reached maturity. Incremental and insignificant improvements in battery energy density will not satisfy the growing customer demand nor enable the renewable energy future we desire. The need for new and improved battery materials is widely recognized within the energy industry and research communities as the main bottleneck towards realizing next-generation electrochemical energy storage solutions. The proposed solution is to develop silicon-based battery materials with energy density levels that substantially exceed the standard graphite anode material. Most importantly, the silicon-based material described in this SBIR proposal is carefully engineered so that it can be (a) processed on a large scale so that it can meet the demand of the rapidly growing battery market and (b) introduced into current anode formulations without the need of any change to current battery manufacturing schemes. In other words, the proposed new battery material is a “drop-in” additive that can be easily integrated into current battery architecture to provide an immediate boost in performance. The performance of silicon-based additives for batteries is strongly dependent on the quality of feedstock silicon powders. It has been found that silicon nanoparticles produced via a low-temperature plasma process are superior to commercially available ones, as they enable significant improvement in various battery performance metrics. The applicant proposes to develop its own pilot-scale low-temperature plasma reactor, primarily based on proprietary technology developed by the University of Minnesota. A critical novelty in this approach will be using trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) as the chemical precursor, as this is significantly less expensive and safer to handle than the most commonly utilized silane (SiH4). Completing this project will provide the applicant with silicon particles that are superior in quality and significantly less expensive than currently commercially available. This will, in turn, allow the applicant to make significant progress towards a minimally viable product and enter the commercialization phase."

For more than a decade, the fabrication process, from creating the assembly to installation had an unacceptable chance of failure. There is a need including Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) has a need for glass-metal fritted fiber-optic faceplate assemblies for use with associated particle imaging (API) D-T neutron generators. Solving the glass-metal seal challenge in the above context is part of a larger effort to improve the state-of-the-art in associated particle imaging (API) D-T neutron generators. There is a strong preference to install fiber-optic faceplate assemblies over simpler monolithic glass viewports. Based on InnoSys’ current business of making high performance vacuum electronic devices (VEDs), circuits, and electronics including glass-metal fritted fabrication, assembly, and manufacturing, we propose to develop, implement, and commercialize a family of highly reliable, robust fiber optic glass to metal seals that can be reproducibly manufactured as vacuum barrier fiber optic coupling to at-atmosphere optical detector instrumentation. To address this problem and opportunity, the approach to be used in this DOE SBIR relies on the use of InnoSys’ core technology which includes glass to metal seals including frit seals of glass to metal that has been developed and matured into products and, as a result, InnoSys has all of the requisite, theoretical knowledge, simulation experience for glass to metal fabrication and sealing and related technical knowledge and capabilities to develop methodologies and approaches supported by fundamental physics and practical engineering to address this SBIR topic on glass to metal fritted fiber optic assemblies for applications specifically for alpha particle detection in neutron generators.

Elucidating the Dynamic Surfaces of Solar Photocatalysts to Solve the Durability Crisis,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023139,"Gregoire, John",John.Gregoire@californiainstituteoftechnology,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Solar photochemistry comprises the scientific basis for solar fuel generation technology, where concerted efforts have led and continue to lead to the discovery and understanding of molecules and materials for solar harvesting and selective chemical transformations. As the breadth of performant molecules and materials has expanded, the community has established that the greatest scientific challenges relate to the molecular-level processes that dictate durability with respect to both sustained performance and retention of the constituent atoms in each component material. Photocatalyst materials are central to solar fuels science and technology, providing multiple functionalities from solar harvesting, carrier transport, and catalysis of the desired chemical transformation. Nearly all photocatalysts, especially those that harvest visible light, have dynamic surfaces under operation due to interfacial reactions with the electrolyte. While scientific understanding and design principles for the semiconductor aspects of photocatalysts are well established, the dynamics of the photocatalyst-electrolyte interface and the implications for durability are relatively underexplored. The molecular-level processes that underlie the dynamics of this interface are not amenable to direct observation, motivating an approach to understand the molecular processes by establishing models that describe the consequences of an ensemble of molecular processes. Characterizing the ensemble effects and establishing the pertinent electrochemical environment parameters may be achieved by measuring the performance and aqueous concentrations of the photocatalyst’s constituent elements, especially the metal elements. The environmental parameters include illumination intensity and wavelength, temperature, electrochemical potential, pH, and other aspects of the electrolyte composition. Establishing a predictive model for the performance and aqueous metals concentrations as a function of these multiple parameters requires the combination of kinetic rate models and experimental data from which the model parameters can be learned. With existing experimental capabilities and the associated throughput of approximately 1 researcher-year per photocatalyst for comprehensive characterization, generating such data is prohibitively expensive to address a broad range of photocatalysts. By developing data science methods to guide and learn from automated experiments, we will accelerate the durability characterize of operational photocatalysts 100-fold. The resulting operational durability maps will provide unprecedented understanding of photocatalyst dynamics. The models will also be deployed to predict pairings of photocatalysts and electrochemical conditions that give rise to solid-electrolyte interfaces with efficient solar chemical conversion, which comprises the greatest opportunity for achieving the requisite decades-long durability for a deployable solar fuels technology. The proposed work is uniquely enabled by the state-of-the-art experiment automation and data science capabilities that have been developed over the past decade in Caltech’s High Throughput Experimentation group. By leveraging this expertise and capabilities, research support will be efficiently utilized to carry out the aggressive 3-phase research project based on 1) establishing the capability for operational durability mapping; 2) accelerating knowledge generation by integrating data science into the experiment workflow, and 3) learning the history-dependence of photocatalyst durability, which provides the basis for development of activity-regeneration protocols as well as predictions for device-level time scales. The proposed work will elevate durability science from the greatest vulnerability to the greatest asset of solar photochemistry basic sciences."

Annually, nearly 200 million metric tons of ethylene are produced worldwide, with demand steadily increasing. At present, ethylene is derived almost exclusively from fossil fuels and a small percentage from bioethanol by energy intensive processes, resulting in substantial carbon emissions. Biological production of ethylene is necessary for a sustainable bioeconomy. The long-term goal of this project is the development of robust and efficient pathways for the microbial conversion of renewable lignocellulose and CO2 feedstocks into impactful levels of ethylene. Many organisms utilize pathways requiring oxygen to synthesize ethylene, leading to combustion hazards. This is circumvented by the newly discovered anaerobic ethylene cycle, which enables oxygen-free conversion of abundant CO2 and lignocellulose feedstocks to ethylene. The anaerobic ethylene cycle converts methionine derivatives to ethylene and subsequently regenerates methionine via a specific and previously unknown reductase related to the nitrogenase family of enzymes. Gene homologs of the pathway are present in multiple industrially tractable photosynthetic and lignocellulosic bacteria. However, current metabolic models reveal that production of ethylene precursor compounds from methionine by tightly regulated secondary metabolic processes is a key flux constraint in all organisms. Based on the discovery by this team of a genetically regulated nitrogenase-like system and the key metabolic bottleneck that limits ethylene yields, the following Specific Aims will be addressed: Specific Aim 1: Overcome the known flux and regulation constrains of the anaerobic ethylene cycle. Specific Aim 2: Construct and employ systems-level predictive metabolic models of photosynthetic and lignocellulosic bacteria to identify points of regulation that support or compete with ethylene production. Specific Aim 3: Engineer photosynthetic and cellulolytic bacteria for high-yield ethylene production from CO2 and lignocellulose. These aims will be addressed through an integrative approach of i) metabolic and genetic engineering; genome mining; ii) DNA synthesis, and functional gene selection of optimal anaerobic ethylene cycle genes; and iii) physics-based thermodynamics and kinetics modeling of bacterial metabolism. To overcome flux constraints (Aim 1) we have devised a metabolic bypass for the direct production of ethylene precursor compounds from methionine using viral hydrolase enzymes. Genome mining and selection pipelines will recover top-performing hydrolases and newly discovered ethylene-forming reductases that optimize ethylene production. Coordinately, regulatory constraints will be overcome through transcription factor and promoter engineering to construct an actively transcribed anaerobic ethylene cycle gene network. Predictive model simulations of ethylene production by photosynthetic and lignocellulosic bacteria (Aim 2) will provide significant insights into regulation strategies and best combinations of top-performing ethylene cycle genes required to optimize ethylene production while minimizing trade-off costs to the cells. These gene and regulatory strategies will be subsequently engineered into host photosynthetic and lignocellulose bacteria in a combinatorial and modular manner (Aim 3). Ultimately this will result in engineered bacterial systems that produce robust ethylene yields from CO2 and lignocellulose."

As nuclear energy companies design next-generation reactor technology, they are slowed by the lack of accessible and reliable engineering simulation for engineers who are not computational specialists. The company has verified through its own market research the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s assertion that solution-error estimation and adaptivity is key to addressing the accessibility of these tools to non-experts. Such a technology will automate one of the most error-prone and confusing parts of finite element analysis for non-experts. The company is developing fully automatic solver-driven adaptivity based on isogeometric analysis and integrating it with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s leading open-source multi-physics code, which will enable non-expert engineers to achieve verified solutions. In Phase I, the company implemented spline-based adaptivity and released it in their commercial preprocessing software that is heavily used in the nuclear industry. They also demonstrated the accurate results of adaptivity with an isogeometric analysis solver and began integrating adaptability with the DOE open-source code. In Phase II, the company will expand the adaptivity algorithms from two dimensions to three dimensions, complete the integration with the DOE code, and implement next generation approaches to adaptivity to allow for greater efficiency in solving simulations. Three commercial nuclear customers are providing benchmarks and feedback throughout Phase II. The benefits of fully automatic adaptivity include reduced development time and cost, improved designs, better understanding of risk, and quantifiable confidence in analysis results and engineering decisions in the nuclear industry. Broad commercial applications and benefits to other segments of the modeling and simulation industry are also likely. Others face many of the same problems as nuclear energy when it comes to quantifying accuracy, particularly in the areas of automotive, defense, and additive manufacturing. They will experience the same benefits of faster development, better decision-making, and higher confidence through the technology developed in this proposal."

In Phase I the conceptual design of a 30 Tesla solenoid magnet was developed using the recently successful, record-breaking 32 Tesla REBCO-based magnet made by MagLab as a starting point. New coil fabrication techniques were studied and a suitable magnet power supply with quench management system was designed. In Phase II the work will be extended to the final design and construction of a working UHF magnet. Challenges in energizing, stabilizing, and protecting the magnet from damage in the face of intense magnetic forces and high stored energy will be overcome using careful and comprehensive analysis, novel engineering design, and a modular, scalable manufacturing approach.

Electrical power lines are a well- documented direct cause of a relevant fraction of the most devastating wildfires in recent history resulting in significant damages being assessed against our customers, the power utilities, often to the brink of bankruptcy. The proposed wildfire monitoring system prevents the damage caused from these electric grid related wildfires by providing utility customers with a push notification alert, a picture, and situational awareness data all triggered by our Artificial Intelligence-based detection system. This approach ensures that stakeholders get, in seconds, the data that they need to confirm the issue is not a false positive. Unlike other systems, we work along transmission lines, sensing fire initiation below the forest canopy. We can detect and report fires in their earliest stages, before the forest is up in smoke, while storing images and sensor data for root cause verification. During Phase I, a functioning demonstrator was built and tested near power lines. A prototype software solution was also implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of several future improvements. We created a solution that can selectively relay the data from our device directly to a visualization portal, making it accessible from any web enabled device. During Phase II, the prototype system will be iteratively improved and tested to create a viable minimum commercial offering. Similarly, the software on both the field devices and on the server will be upgraded to create a sophisticated technology platform that is user friendly. Both the hardware and software features will need to comply with the regulatory framework that manages the deployment of devices on grid assets. The anticipated yearly benefits of deploying our system across 10,000 miles of conductor are: (1) peoples’ and animals’ lives saved, (2) 1.5 billion dollars from reduced direct damages and firefighting costs, and (3) 138 million dollars in reduced high impact environmental damage from prevented Greenhouse Gas emissions estimated at 1 million metric tons, or the equivalent impact of taking around 200,000 cars off the road. Additional applications will provide early warning for fire vulnerable communities, better target aerial firefighting response to picture validated fires, reduce the duration of economy-damaging Public Safety Power Shutoff events, and inform the insurance market with granular risk data to retain home insurance policies."

Raymond Corporation and Fermata Energy is classified as Vehicle to grid application. ES2 lab - NSF/University Cooperative research center will evaluate the performance in the Data center Hybrid Microgrid Resiliency applications. Large scale deployment of BESS will enable storage during off peak-load time; help better integration of Renewable energy by mitigating intermittencies and assists in other grid support function. Due to inherent flexibility, Dual active Bridge Converter (DABC) is used as an interface between BESS and grid. DABC Provide the Galvanic isolation, Level shifting and soft switching to minimize the power conversion losses. In DABC- either PWM controlled, or frequency controlled resonant types- besides the turn’s ratio of the HF transformer, its leakage and magnetizing inductances play active and critical roles.to realize the soft switching of the power devices. The proposed LOI has three areas of Thrusts as follows: • Integrating precise leakage and magnetizing inductances in the HF transformer for DABC • Methods of printing the cores using high saturation flux and high temperature Nano-crystalline material on PCBs leading to uniform HF transformers with precise parameters in high performance mass produced DABCs for BESS to AC grid integration • Testing of the magnetics on a DABC with Li-ion BESS. The leakage inductance on both primary and secondary windings due to the non-coupled portion of the magnetic flux which can be utilized to form the series inductors on the two sides of the transformer. The approach proposed by BU’s power electronics group reduces the reluctance of the leakage flux path in a controlled manner in the two PCB windings of the HF Transformer by introducing additional U-I magnetic cores of different geometries on the windings, an example is depicted in Fig. 1. The advantages are: • Reduced EMI of the magnetic components due to better confinement of this flux in the auxiliary cores. • Elimination of external AC inductors and their losses in DABC, • Integration of precise leakage and magnetizing inductors by adjusting the geometry and permeability of the cores in HF DABC Transformers. Thrust-2: AM of the multi-core transformer on PCBs using nano-crystalline material. Presently Nano crystalline material is produced using spin casting or Rapid solidification Process. Ribbon is wound in ‘C’, ‘E’ or toroidal shape to realize the desired core shapes. With conventional core manufacturing techniques, one cannot realize the full benefits of high curie temp, high flux density of Nano core production methods do not lend itself to effective heat dissipation-compromising the performance more. AM using gas atomized powder can help us alleviate these limitations of the conventional core and component fabrication. AM has been studied for soft magnets for Electrical machines by NREL/ORNL. It is highly likely to integrate the entire converter and magnetics using the AM techniques. Success of these techniques will streamline the supply chain, reduce the cost, and optimize the use of Nanocrystalline properties of the core for reduced losses, increased power density and operation above 150?C. Exploiting the incredible cooling rates of AM (106-107 °C/sec) available at BU’s Powder bed metal selective laser melting printer (EOS m290), HF nanocrystalline magnetic material conforming to the geometry shown in Fig. 1 can be printed using AM.1 Through engineered spatial cooling gradients, the formation of lower electrical conductivity dendrites can be controlled, for lowering the electrical conductivity in the direction in which eddy currents form inside the magnetic core thus reducing eddy current losses relative to conventional ribbon form of this material at HF operation (=100 kHz). Also, critical to this effort, BU’s AM research group has developed a printing process to print metals onto silicon and dielectrics, which will be adapted to print directly onto fiber glass reinforced FR4 PCBs for DABC and to bond dielectric airgaps.2–4 This can be achieved by using a low-melting point alloy that reactively bonds to the FR4 and most metals.

The complexity of these functional materials often leads to intricate electronic textures that emerge at the mesoscopic scale, such as stripes and checkerboards in high-temperature superconductors, metallic filaments in resistive-switching materials, and skyrmions in itinerant magnets. An accurate and comprehensive dynamical modeling of these electronic textures, however, is a challenging multi-scale task. On the one hand, large-scale dynamical simulations are necessary to properly describe mesoscopic pattern formation processes. On the other hand, sophisticated electronic structure methods and many-body techniques have to be employed to compute the electronic contribution to the driving forces of the mesoscale textures. Repeated quantum calculations that are computationally expensive thus significantly limit the accessible scale of dynamical simulations. The machine learning (ML) force-field methods, originally pioneered in quantum chemistry to enable large-scale ab initio molecular dynamics, are generalized to condensed-matter systems, including correlated electron models and itinerant magnets. The central idea of this approach is to utilize the universal expressive capability of deep-learning neural networks to develop an accurate and efficient model for computing the generalized force fields. By effectively emulating the time-consuming many-body calculations, the ML framework combines the best of two worlds: the efficiency of classical force-field models and the desired accuracy of quantum calculations. Specific implementations of descriptors, which are a crucial component for ensuring symmetry and enhancing performance of ML models, will be benchmarked and optimized. Also importantly, in order to describe dynamical behaviors of driven systems, the ML framework will be further developed to model force fields that originate from highly nonequilibrium electrons. The dynamical behaviors of complex mesoscopic structures are not only of fundamental interest, but also crucial to the understanding of novel material functionalities. For example, the properties of the electronic liquid crystalline states are believed to play a crucial role in the emergence of high temperature superconductivity. Another case in point is the dynamical control and manipulation of complex spin textures by electrical means, which are central to the success of the spintronics technology. Large-scale dynamical simulations enabled by ML force-field models will shed new light on the dynamics of complex electronic textures, which in turn will lead to valuable insights on the design and engineering of these functional electronic systems. Finally, the ML framework developed in this project is expected to open new frontiers in the research of correlated electron materials and other complex electronic systems."

Penn/HKU) A key challenge in the ability to bound metastability is the need to characterize materials when they are not in an equilibrium state, which is not only relevant to nuclear energy but also to phenomena in power generation and quantum devices. Extreme service conditions under nuclear reactor operation provide substantial hurdles for current structural materials, foreshadowing limitations in reactor design and performance. High-entropy alloys (HEAs), also known as compositionally complex alloys (CCAs), have been suggested as potential solutions toward more radiation tolerant materials; while immunity to severe irradiation is far-reaching, CCAs exhibit improved response to radiation damage through the suppression of complex dislocation formation in comparison to their dilute alloy counterparts. This proposal aims to explore the hypothesis that metastability thresholds in GB sink efficiency are diffuse in contrast to their counterparts in dilute alloys, which are sharp. We are motivated by the goal to define how metastability is tuned by variable defect bias in CCAs. In materials possessing a complex energetic landscape, we hypothesize that the role of the GB vicinity, in addition to the GB itself, is of paramount importance. We aim to define GB metastability in a broader context to allow for the inclusion of matrix bias and further expect that the regimes in which GB responses leverage metastability will deviate in CCAs from that observed in pure/dilute alloys. Through a combined experimental and multi-scale modeling approach to predict and measure matrix bias to understand the defect landscape’s heterogeneity by analyzing lattice-level local ordering, quantifying the GB response to the variance in defect landscapes, and defining regime thresholds in compositionally complex alloy systems, we will develop a robust model for damage regimes at GBs inclusive of variable order landscapes found in complex alloys. Overall, the design of materials to incorporate self-healing or self-mitigating properties by of sink strength through chemical complexity is of critical importance for future nuclear energy technology. The methods by which metastability can be tuned by variable defect bias in compositionally complex alloys presents a viable pathway toward this goal."

Realizing these reductions requires a &ldquo;step change&rdquo; in separation technology from heat-based techniques (e.g., distillation) to molecular size- and shape-based techniques. Molecular sieving membranes have shown promise for separating molecules based on subtle differences in molecular size and shape; however, this sieving ability often occurs at ideal conditions far away from what might be encountered in the field. Indeed, a critical scientific challenge is the development of relationships between membrane microstructure and the transport of competing guest molecules (i.e., water molecules and organic molecules) under realistic operating conditions. To address this challenge, this research project aims to create disordered carbonaceous molecular sieve membranes and challenge these membranes with water-organic mixtures found in real-world settings (e.g., produced water). More specifically, the experimental campaign conducted in this project will result in (i) the creation of a test set of molecular sieve membranes with a variety of micropore sizes and structures, (ii) the development of relationships between the membrane pore size/structure and the adsorption and diffusion of water-organic mixtures within the membrane material, and (iii) the capability to predict permeation of complex water-organic mixtures in disordered microporous membranes.

The most important feature of ATF’s plasma accelerators will be the relatively large size of the bubble (~ 300 µm), the properties of which can be studied precisely via external e-beam injection. The combination offers a sound foundation for generating very stable high-quality beams in plasma-driven accelerators, with parameters comparable to those realized in modern conventional accelerators. The proposed work will yield the first comprehensive study of bubble-regime LWFAs driven by CO2 lasers. The second goal in this proposal is to create trailing beams with tailored density profiles, which would lead to a uniform accelerating field and high energy transfer efficiency in a PWFA based at FACET II user facility. We will use a method known as beam-induced ionization injection to create these trailing electron beams. The longitudinal profile of this trailing beam can be manipulated by taking advantage of the correlation between the injector’s and the electron beam’s density profiles. This is a creative and original approach because it is the first that seeks to shape the trailing beam’s density (on a micron scale) by indirectly controlling the helium injector density (on a millimeter scale). The aims of this proposal will be accomplished by integrating the expertise across the disciplines of fluid mechanics and plasma-based particle acceleration. Our specific aims will contribute to the understanding of the physics of PWFA and beam-plasma interactions as well as propelling the PWFA technology towards generating collider-quality beams."

Wirth, Governor’s Chair Professor Department of Nuclear Engineering, Knoxville, TN 37996-2300 This project seeks to perform a complementary multiscale modeling and experimental research project to predict and verify the microstructural response of iron-based structural materials, and the corresponding property and performance degradation in the fusion neutron environment. Realizing the promise of fusion as a commercially attractive 21st century energy source requires the development of advanced structural materials capable of sustained operation in an incredibly hostile environment. The performance demands on first-wall armor, vacuum vessel and blanket systems of future fusion power plants are beyond the capability of current materials, which is one of the reasons that the United States National Academy of Engineering has ranked the quest for fusion as one of the top grand challenges for engineering in the 21st Century. Fusion reactor first wall and blanket structural materials will operate in harsh irradiation conditions including high displacement rates from a neutron energy spectrum peaked at 14 MeV, and accompanying high production levels of hydrogen and helium, as well as exposure to permeating tritium generated in the breeding blanket. The main focus of this project is to evaluate the dynamic material microstructural evolution driven by 14-MeV neutron irradiation, and corresponding microstructure influence on tritium permeation and retention. Defect and microstructural evolution occurs together with the transport, clustering and fate of helium and hydrogen isotopes as the gas atom species interact with the evolving microstructure within ferritic-martensitic alloys, and Fe-Cr based model alloys, during service as fusion structural first wall and breeding blanket materials. As well, we plan to initiate a modeling evaluation of the high temperature mechanical behavior of these alloys to provide a basis for predicting high temperature helium embrittlement. The defect cluster evolution, and gas interactions, ultimately dictate the storage of tritium within fusion structural materials and thus contribute to the overall tritium inventory within the fusion reactor. The proposed approach to unraveling the complex, interconnected physical phenomena controlling the underlying science of defect species – gas interactions involves an integration of computational modeling approaches with experimental exposure and characterization. This program addresses several critical questions associated with first wall and blanket structural materials performance of iron-based and ferritic-martensitic alloys, and is focused on the following three specific issues: i) improving our knowledge of microstructural evolution in fusion-relevant ferritic-martensitic alloys in prototypic fusion environments, including the fundamentals of defect production and evolution, dislocation loop microstructure evolution, and helium bubble nucleation, and assessing the mechanisms that control bubble to void transitions and determine the incubation dose for the onset of void swelling; ii) unraveling the complex and synergistic interactions between He and H that control the amount of tritium retention in the fusion first wall armor, vacuum vessel and breeding blanket structural materials; and iii) initiating a computational modeling analysis to better determine the fundamental materials science controlling the mechanisms of high temperature helium embrittlement in coupled creep and fatigue stress loading conditions."

Genetic diversity in the molecular and physiological underpinnings of woody biomass growth continues to be explored for its potential adoption in tree improvement. Most of what is known about these underpinnings has come from the study of development and expansion growth during the summer or indoors. However, the woody bole of a field-grown tree is physiologically active year-round. In temperate deciduous tree species, physiological and metabolic adjustments are essential to confer winter protection in the wood-forming tissues. Broader implications of these presumably costly processes for year-round growth have not been reported. We aim to advance our understanding of how molecular control of the winter latent state is linked to perennial woody biomass productivity. We propose to focus on two complementary Populus experimental systems, P. trichocarpa with rich population genomic resources and the fast-growing hybrid P. tremula x P. alba INRA 717-1B4 (717) with proven transformation and genome editing efficiencies. A multi-pronged approach integrating stem RNA-Seq, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, high precision CRISPR genome editing, and gene network modeling will be used to investigate transcriptome regulation in woody stem tissues during the winter. Of particular interest are genome duplicates that exhibit either winter-biased expression or divergent seasonal expression in both species. GWAS and eQTL predictions will be experimentally tested by CRISPR editing of coding or cis-regulatory sequences for investigating their functional links to seasonal growth transitions and woody biomass accrual. Confirmed mutants will be field-tested for seasonal growth transitions, transcript and metabolite profiling, and histological analysis. The transcriptomics data will feed back into regulatory network construction to improve inference of winter processes controlled by seasonal biased genes or their regulators. A key deliverable will be the contribution of winter stem transcriptomes to existing expression data obtained primarily from actively expanding tissues. The data will be integrated within KBase to promote further research efforts. Understanding how seasonal growth dynamics impact woody biomass productivity will offer new targets for bioenergy crop improvement."

We will introduce a higher level of abstraction at theoperator regressionlevel that can be expressed using deep neural layers, kernels, graphs and spiking neural networks (SNNs), and implemented in the next generation of power-efficient advanced computing architectures. The threepillarsof our research are neural operators, graph networks, and SNNs, with threecross-cutting themeson the mathematics of machine learning, uncertainty quantification (UQ) and trustworthy PIMI, and causal inference. These pillars allow co-design of mathematics and computing hardware to augment foundational understanding and optimal control of complex systems spanning extremely disparate scales, e.g., climate modeling processes, as well as embedded systems and systems-of-systems requiring causal inference and physics-informed modeling. We have assembleda new teamof applied mathematicians, computer scientists, neuroscientists and application scientists aiming to change this paradigm by developing newefficientneural operators for the post-Moore era with PIMI. The goals of SEA-CROGS are to bring rigorous and scalable PIMI to computational science and engineering (CSE) while simultaneously advancing PIMI in a pull-push interaction. Challenges and Three Proposed Research Areas (RAs):Our group has developed the two main pillars of SciML, namely neural PDEs (PINNs) and neural operators (DeepOnet), but significant problems remain related to theory, generalization, efficiency, scalability, and excessive computational cost. To tackle the issues of tremendous resolution demands for climate models, representation and automation of complex systems, and the requirements for low-power and real-time inference in embedded systems, we urgently need aparadigm shift. InRA-I, we will focus on the theory and new algorithmic developments of operator regression networks, including multimodality training, continual learning, multitasking, and hybrid discretization-surrogate formulations.In RA-II, we will develop graph neural and kernel networks for operator regression, and we will deal with causal inference and complexity of multiscale/multiphysics systems at scale. One aspect of the proposed research will be focused on the development of a Computational Graph Completion (CGC) framework for representing, organizing, and reasoning with computational knowledge in analogy with category theory that has served as a mathematical model for breaking up mathematical models into their fundamental pieces analyzed through their functorial relationships. We will also develop a foundational theory for Graph-Informed Neural Networks (GINNs), a hybrid approach combining deep learning with probabilistic graphical models. InRA-III, we will develop physics-informed SNNs and spiking neural operators. The event-driven behavior of SNNs can be efficiently implemented on neuromorphic hardware to yield > 100x magnitude energy efficiency compared to that of conventional deep learning on GPUs. However, no previous works have focused on regression, and training SNNs remains a challenge due to the non-differentiability of the spiking neurons. Management, Dissemination and DEI. SEA-CROGS will organize student and postdoc exchanges, webinars, workshops, summer schools, research-visit exchanges, with significant new activities on recruiting and engaging underrepresented groups, and a close partnership with Spelman College.

The specific objectives of the project are: (1) To test how 23 years of climate change alter microbial interactions in the field and affect the fate and formation of soil carbon by integrating quantitative stable isotope probing, ‘omics, and a carbon tracer. (2) To quantify microbiome interactions that change the biochemical and assemblage-scale efficiency of carbon use and its fate in soil using experiments that manipulate temperature, predation, and water availability. (3) To infer ecological interactions using multi-layer network analysis, machine learning, and ecological models. This project will investigate the role of ecological interactions within the soil microbiome and their role in soil carbon cycling and persistence. The work is set in the context of a long-term warming experiment, in which a final soil harvest is planned for 2024, 23 years after the experiment began. The project will harness the power of isotope tracers and ‘omics (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics) to test the long-term impacts of climate change (temperature × precipitation) on ecological interactions and soil carbon cycling and persistence. Objective 1 will be met by conducting field measurements as part of a long-term climate change study (temperature × precipitation) in a montane meadow, initiated in 2002. In this experiment, massive loss of soil carbon and functional changes in the microbiome suggest that both cooperative (between “friends”) and antagonistic (between “foes”) microbial interactions mediate soil carbon cycling and persistence. Objective 2 will involve focused laboratory experiments to test hypotheses about the short- and long-term effects of climate change as mediated by the direct effects of temperature and water availability as well as indirect effects mediated by changes in microbial interactions. The focus on short- and long- term effects addresses the interpretive challenge that the effects of warming change over time. This project will advance the field by clarifying the roles of microbial interactions in such sequential responses. Objective 3 focuses on synthesizing multiple data streams simultaneously using existing multi-layer analytical tools to infer interactions in the microbiome, the strong threads through the complex web of the microbiome that indicate biological pathways and controls over energy and carbon flow. Work under objective 3 will develop new approaches that support combining ecological models with machine learning. Microorganisms are major engines of the land carbon cycle, influencing the composition and radiative properties of the atmosphere by both creating and consuming soil organic carbon at a global scale. Soil organic carbon provides multiple ecosystem services, and, when respired, exacerbates climate change. This work investigates the interactions in microbial communities that underpin these dual roles of microorganisms in creating and consuming soil carbon. The project will push the frontier of isotope-enabled genomics by connecting isotope-informed ‘omics to theory about interactions in ecological communities and their effects on soil carbon cycling and persistence."

In response, the proposed program seeks to uncover, understand, and model the synergies between chemistry and structural defects controlling the development and evolution of chemical partitioning via radiation-induced segregation (RIS) at defect sinks in alloys during irradiation. Microstructural features that develop during irradiation, i.e. dislocation loops, cavities, and RIS, are typically studied in isolation in an effort to reduce the complexity of the problem. However, such an approach masks their inherent interactions. Instead, we contend that RIS is highly sensitive to, and interacts with the microstructure developing in the vicinity of grain boundaries due to the synergies and competition for point defects. Therefore, through integrated ex-situ and in-situ experimental, computational, and data analytics approaches, the proposed program will address fundamental questions linking the temporal and spatial evolution of RIS at grain boundaries and dislocations and the development of alloy microstructures in the proximity of such defect sinks. While these scientific questions are universal and the findings will generally be extendable to any alloy system, the work will focus on concentrated multicomponent alloys which have not yet been widely investigated. The proposed methodology will vastly expand the range of experimental conditions to enable extrapolation of materials behavior to modern reactor conditions, push existing models that are unable to account for untapped synergies and multiple length and time scales, and will resolve conflicting literature data. All results will be disseminated via open data sharing platforms and non-proprietary computational and data analysis codes."
Fast outer loop solution algorithms based on a coherent coupling of physical and machine learning models,Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research,DE-SC0021313,"Sandu, Adrian",Adrian.Sandu@virginiapolytechnicinstituteandstateuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Many applications of interest to the DOE are solved by ``outer loop'' algorithms that require repeated runs of ``inner loop'' (forward) simulations. For example, decisions based on model predictions (e.g., location of wind farms) require the uncertainty quantification of model outputs (e.g., predicted wind velocities per location and time), reduction in uncertainty by solving inverse problems (e.g., calibrating the numerical weather model using available meteorological data), and quantifying the posterior uncertainty in modeled decision variables (e.g., mean energy). Conventional algorithms to solve outer loop applications face important computational challenges. The computational cost of each inner loop run is typically large, as forward simulations are complex multiphysics models (e.g., of weather or the power grid). In the same time, the number of forward runs required for an accurate outer loop solution is also large (e.g., the number of iterations in system optimization, or the number of samples in Monte Carlo uncertainty quantification.) All in all, the cost of solving outer loop problems by conventional algorithms is at least one order of magnitude larger than the (already sizeable) cost of running the inner loop simulations. Consequently, conventional algorithms for solving outer loop problems are challenged by extreme computational requirements. This project seeks to overcome the above challenges by developing computationally light surrogate models that approximate the dynamics of the high fidelity (inner-loop) models. The surrogate models are obtained by augmenting conventional numerical analysis and statistical approaches with machine learning methodologies and are used to accelerate both the inner loop simulations and the outer loop calculations. A mathematically rigorous framework is developed to couple inner-loop surrogate and high fidelity simulations, and outer loop solvers, such as to ensure the accuracy of the computed outer-loop solutions at minimal overall computational cost."

Preceding a collision, the structure of colliding high energy objects is not very well understood. It is expected, that when probed at very high energies, heavy nuclei, and even protons, appear as very dense clouds of gluons, carriers of the strong interaction. High gluon density is an intrinsically new regime of the theory, whichdoes not conform toconventional theoretical treatment. The main objective of thiswork is to advance the theory of high-energy collisions of dense gluonic objects, using first-principle theoretical approaches. Our specific goals include a systematic theoretical framework to study physics of gluon saturation, an application of the framework tohadro-hadron, electron-hadron and ultra-peripheral nuclear collisions,crystallizing the importance of genuine quantum effects in hadronic wave function and the role of the entanglement entropy released in high energy collisions.

In many cases, the most challenging separations are for small molecules that differ by less than an Angstrom in size, a dimension that is approximately equivalent to only one millionth the thickness of a strand of human hair. These challenging separations are often accomplished by processes like distillation, which require energy-intensive phase changes, or absorption, which require the use of environmentally harmful solvents. An energy efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to these traditional processes is membrane-based separations. Today, nearly all gas separation membranes are formed from entropically disordered yet easily processable polymers, which can be formed at scale into selective thin films of only 100 nm thick. Unfortunately, the disordered nature of these state-of-the-art polymers precludes using them for some of the most energy-intensive and environmentally relevant separations that are practiced today. This research program envisions a strategic shift in materials design to template ordered free volume elements into otherwise entropically disordered polymers. Free volume elements describe the nanoscopic spacing devoid of electron density that allows molecules to diffuse in polymer films. To create isoporous free volume elements with molecular precision, processable polymers are synthesized with chemical moieties of the exact shape and size of small molecules that need to be separated. By tethering these moieties to a polymer backbone by weak chemical bonds, selective thin films can be formed using traditional approaches. However, after forming the films, these bonds can be selectively and quantitatively broken. Through careful experimental design, these moieties decompose into small molecules and can be removed from the polymer matrix, leaving behind isoporous free volume elements designed for a specific separation. Various chemical moieties can be incorporated to leverage the versatility of this approach for a variety of separation applications. In addition to the potential benefits in separation performance, this strategy also permits access to creating polymers that have identical chemical composition but unique packing structures, which can enable a fundamental decoupling of materials performance from processing considerations. To target these opportunities, advanced strategies in design, synthesis, and characterization will be coupled with theory to create new membrane materials capable of separating complex chemical mixtures into pure molecules with Angstrom-level resolution."

However, biofuels production is hindered by the crystallinity of cellulose, which makes it difficult to hydrolyze, and by the presence of lignin and hemicellulose, which act as steric impediments that prevent access of cellulase enzymes to their cellulose substrate. Improved understanding of how the composition and architecture of lignocellulose affect the activities of degradative enzymes will improve efforts to engineer enzymes optimized for efficient and cost-effective bioenergy production. The goal of this project is to build a multimodal optical microscope to measure the binding, processive degradation, and pausing behaviors of cellulases as they interact with and degrade both synthetic and naturally occurring lignocellulosic walls. To achieve this, we will use high spatio-temporal single-molecule imaging to track cellulases, while visualizing specific molecular components of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose, that make up their lignocellulose substrate. The microscope will combine Interferometric Scattering (iSCAT), which provides unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution; Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF), which provides single-molecule resolution of multiple fluorophore-labeled molecules; and Stochastic Reconstruction (STORM), which allows for three-dimensional super-resolution imaging of intact plant cell walls during degradation. Initial studies will investigate cellulase dynamics on in vitro-assembled cell wall analogs, and later work will progress to using native plant cell walls.

The understanding of how chemical transformations occur in real, complex environments is fundamental to our ability to control them and scale them for our needs. Further, at these complex interfaces, chemical transformations occur in a markedly efficient and directed manner and are therefore catalytic, or occur with underpinnings which are understandable and tunable. Ultrafast chemistry at heterogeneous, condensed phase interfaces (e.g. solid-liquid) develops and applies approaches to reveal how the dynamics of charge across the interface, and between molecular reactants, controls reactivity. Previously, the ultrafast excitation and efficient charge separation at the n-SrTiO3/aqueous interface resolved the formation and decay of first reactive intermediate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water (Ti-OH*) using transient spectroscopies. This led to a mapping between experimentally derived parameters, inherently kinetic, to thermodynamic free-energy descriptors, usually confined to theory. The proposed research aims to discover how interfacial aqueous structure modulates Ti-OH* formation and decay, identify vibrational structures of the Ti-OH* population during dark, thermochemical steps, and time-resolve the next reaction step (formation of the O-O bond). The research will also vary the duty cycle and repetition rate of the light and voltage pulses in order to regulate OER catalysis. Overall, the research will advance the design of catalyst systems for OER by detailing the sequence of reaction steps on a model 3d transition metal oxide. The quantitative information on the structure and kinetics of intermediate formation should provide a foundation for new chemical models of the solid-liquid interface.

Broderick (PI) Montana State University The overall goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the mechanism of biogenesis of the active site metal cluster of [FeFe]-hydrogenase, an efficient catalyst for hydrogen production. The studies discussed in this research proposal will use biochemical and biophysical approaches to elucidate the reactions catalyzed by the three specific hydrogenase maturase enzymes common to all organisms that harbor the [FeFe]-hydrogenase. This research promotes our knowledge of structure/function relationships in complex biological pathways for metal cluster assembly, while additionally contributing to our understanding of how microbes build the protein cofactors that enable them to capture and convert energy. Moreover, as the steps associated with complex metallocofactor biosynthesis are better understood, the knowledge gained will inspire and influence the design of new biomimetic catalysts with applications in biohydrogen technologies. The active site metal cluster of [FeFe]-hydrogenase, referred to as the H-cluster, is a specialized iron-sulfur cluster consisting of a [4Fe-4S] cubane bridged to a 2Fe subcluster that has three carbon monoxide, two cyanide, and a bridging dithiomethylamine group as ligands. Biogenesis of this specialized cluster requires the combined actions of three specific maturation enzymes, denoted HydE, HydF, and HydG. Two of these enzymes (HydE and HydG) are radical-SAM enzymes and use S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and a redox active [4Fe-4S] cluster to initiate radical chemistry. The third protein, HydF, is a GTPase that functions as a scaffold/carrier during H-cluster assembly. During the last funding period, we have gained new insights into the biochemical and spectroscopic properties of HydG and this has in turn informed our understanding of hydrogenase maturation. We have probed the interactions of individual radical SAM maturase enzymes with HydF in an effort to understand the order of events in hydrogenase maturation. Fundamental studies of the mechanism of radical initiation have also been a focus of the last funding period. Finally, we have developed the first fully-defined system that supports in vitro maturation of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase to an active enzyme, a development that enables much of the work proposed for the coming funding period. We will develop a molecular-level understanding of the reactions catalyzed by HydE, HydF, and HydG as well as the interactions between the different maturases, in order to clearly delineate the mechanistic chemistry, the order of events, and the protein-protein interactions involved during H-cluster biosynthesis. Specifically, the project objectives are 1) to determine the role of iron and HydG during maturation, 2) to provide functional and mechanistic insight into HydE and the other maturases by employing our fully-defined maturation system, and 3) to probe the biological pathway of maturation. We have laid a strong foundation for these studies with substantial discoveries in the past funding period, on which we will capitalize as we move forward. This work stands to reveal fundamentally unique biochemical transformations and will help define new paradigms for complex metal cluster assembly in biology. Further, the work will provide understanding and insight needed to develop biohydrogen catalysts employing the [FeFe]-hydrogenase."

Our data indicate that ubiquitin-mediated processes affect key aspects of wood formation in poplar, including the regulation of diameter of water conducting cells which impacts growth rates and resistance to drought. We will utilize proximity labeling strategy in poplar to determine gene function by identification of proteins interacting with a given gene product.

The development of such models must iterate through complex parameterization and tuning. For scientists, it is a labor-intensive, time-consuming process requiring careful consideration and calibration of various trade-offs using their domain knowledge. Selecting the best model and identifying critical parameters among the combinatorically large number of possibilities is just as challenging as looking for a needle in a haystack. To address this challenge, we propose to develop human-in-the-loop visual analytic techniques that enable scientists to proactively supervise, modify, and validate model-based simulations at scale using intelligent data-driven methods. These techniques combine the best of both worlds of intelligent automation, by leveraging the predictive power of machine learning, and human expertise, by developing expressive visualization techniques that intuitively communicate the causes behind good and bad model outcomes. The project's vision is to transform both the process and the outcome of the state-of-the-art scientific model-based simulation processes by providing: i) intelligent steering services that guide scientists in optimally tuning models. ii) advanced visualization techniques allowing scientists to focus on reasoning about factors affecting model performance, and iii) interactive user interfaces that drastically reduce scientists' investment of time in hypothesis generation, experiment configuration, and model validation. We will instantiate the proposed solution in collaboration with climate scientists at national labs by initially focusing on faithful simulation of clouds, which is critical for scientists' understanding and prediction of the global climate and climate change-related patterns."

Radioisotope-based well logging devices have been widely used to measure the physical properties of subsurface rocks such as density, porosity, mineralogy, hydrogen content, etc. Those devices, however, pose radiological security risks, thus, there is an essential need to explore replacement technologies to determine these subsurface parameters without using high-activity radioisotope sources. To this end, we propose to develop an alternative methodology to produce well logs equivalent to gamma ray (GR) and neutron logs from the high-resolution drill-bit vibration data that can be acquired at no risk nor significant cost along the entire well length. Our proposed technology benefits from advanced signal processing and a powerful physics-informed machine learning model to extract the targeted physical properties from bit- vibration signals. The proposed method is based on the concept that a large volume of data is continuously collected by the drill-bit as the first logging tool touching the rock formations while drilling. These data include information about the physical and mechanical rock properties, fluid properties, in-situ stresses, and mineralogy. This information is embedded in a series of high-resolution high-scanning rate vibration signals generated by the rock-bit interaction and of course drilling system configuration. With a good understanding of bit-rock interaction physics and by means of an efficient signal processing approach, it is possible to segregate the signal and extract different information out. In this project, we will develop a signal processing workflow and a physics-informed machine learning (PhiML) model based on bit-rock interaction physics. We will also conduct experimental research at the Drilling Vibration Laboratory of the Oklahoma University to better understand the complex bit-rock interaction and perform sensitivity analysis on the effective parameters. The Phase I outcome will be a combined signal processing and machine learning workflow that determines density, porosity, and clay mineral/organic matter content along the entire well length. In Phase II, we propose to further develop and package the methodology as a product, conduct field testing in different geological formations settings, and commercialize the technology."

One aspect of the separation system is that bicarbonate is separated using an electric field across an anion exchange membrane. Another aspect is non-thermal regeneration. The work aims to elucidate the most important molecular attributes of the ionic liquid-solvent system through a research approach that leverages machine learning, molecular simulations, electronic structure calculations, high throughput experimental screening, and measurements of CO2 absorption rate.

Each of the 17 REs has distinctive and varied electronic properties, and their application requires high purity of every single element. Achieving effective and efficient separation among REs from one another has been challenging since their discovery. Extremely selective separation exists in nature and is governed by a tailored dehydration process and transport pathway with a flat energy landscape. Inspired by the transport mechanism in biological ion channels, we will to build a platform with two-dimensional solid-state ionic channels of dimensions less than 1 nm to modulate the desolvation and transport of RE ions based on their differences in Lewis acidity and ionic radii. This platform allows us to develop synthetic methods to dial several key features that affect transport energy landscape, including channel dimension, channel surface chemistry, and desolvation process. With this platform, we aim to understand, predict, and control the transport selectivity of REs among themselves and with other strong competitor ions from mining, such as Al3+ and Fe3+. We will adopt an integrated approach to gain a deep understanding of REs transport across multiple different length scales through the characterization of monolayer single-flake binding thermodynamics, studying single-channel transport kinetics, and building precise models for channel structure and transport using electronic structure and molecular dynamics calculations to connect the molecular level thermodynamic and kinetic properties to macroscopic membrane performance and realize separation by design."

These systems are frequently reliant on non-rechargeable batteries, resulting in high maintenance costs and providing limits on available power. This in-turn often imposes limits on achievable sampling rates, lengths of deployment, and data resolution, eliminating many exciting future applications, such as recharging resident autonomous vehicles. Harvesting energy from ocean waves can solve these challenges. Sensor platforms that can harness energy from the ocean are approaching commercial viability, although existing approaches still suffer from a low power density and unproven reliability. There also appears to be a gap in the development of smaller systems that are easily deployable without the need for specialist or larger vessels. Oscilla Power Inc. (OPI) sees an opportunity to develop wave energy systems that are smaller and more efficient than current offerings. OPI’s MicroTriton has a class leading efficiency and is adept at capturing energy from waves in low and moderately energetic environments. In this Phase II program, OPI will continue to work with East Carolina University (ECU), and CODAR ocean systems (COS) to build and ocean test the MicroTriton small sized wave energy converter platform. During this Phase II project OPI will complete the detailed design and construction for a MicroTriton system capable of supporting and powering a HF radar transmitter from CODAR. The system will be tested off the coast of North Carolina coast for a period of 6 months. NOAA’s ocean enterprise study identified more than 400 firms in the US generating more than $7 billion in revenue annually. In a broad sense, the benefits derived by developing a wave energy powered instrumentation platform, correspond directly to the benefits expected for a Blue Economy. MicroTriton will enable a significant quantity of high-quality, high-density, real-time ocean data, helping to protect marine and coastal ecosystems, monitor environmental change and aid maritime security."

Orchestrating the Restoration of Wind-Dominant Grids from Blackouts,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021410,"Villegas Pico, Hugo",Hugo.Villegas Pico@iowastateuniversityofscienceandtechnology,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Orchestrating the Restoration of Wind-Dominant Grids from Blackouts H. N. Villegas Pico, Iowa State University (Principal Investigator) This project addresses the black-start capability problem of wind-dominant power systems. At present, restoring a bulk power system from a blackout using wind power generation is problematic because wind turbines resort to synchronous machines to operate and they do not have firm energy resources as a result of wind variability. If wind power plants are not capable of restoring a power system from a blackout, ultra-high penetrations of wind generation can be limited by black-start capability. To prevent this limitation, two specific problems are addressed in this project, namely: (P1) present wind turbines are not designed to operate as black-start resources; (P2) it is difficult, if not impossible, to plan in advance how to orchestrate the restoration of a grid using wind turbines because of the variability of wind energy in time and space. To address the first problem, P1, we propose a system identification approach to design regulators that control the pitch angle of wind turbines’ blades to balance generation and demand. Also, we propose to leverage reference frame theory to design anti-windup current and voltage regulators so that turbines’ power converters withstand severe energization transients. Additionally, we propose an innovative synchronization method for the autonomous operation of multiple wind turbines that prevents loss of synchronism during electric faults. To tackle the second problem, P2, we leverage artificial intelligence as well as a weather and research forecasting model to conceive an innovative artificial restoration director that can create and execute restoration plans according to the availability of wind energy resources. To meet the demand under unexpected variability of wind resources during black start, we also propose theory of variations and historical weather data to size a battery energy storage subsystem. For verification, the project leverages the unique capabilities of the Flatirons campus of the U.S. DOE National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The execution of this project is significant to mitigate the impacts of massive blackouts that have been identified in the relatively recent “North American Energy Resilience Model” by the U.S. DOE, national labs, and industry at the request of Congress. Also, the project is important to alleviate concerns about a decrease in black-start capability and an increase in the likelihood of blackouts because of cyberthreats. The project is central to the state of Iowa because it is becoming wind-dominant; thus, it is reasonable to anticipate that wind power plants must provide black-start services in the area. In the educational domain, this project is important to develop new knowledge to teach present students—our future power engineering workforce—about black-start techniques of wind-dominant grids. Remarkably, this proposal aligns with the third grand challenge in the science of wind energy, viz., systems science for the integration of wind power plants into the future electricity grid, which has been recently published by renowned scientists of the DOE’s National Labs and researchers worldwide. The outcomes of the project will be: (i) two control strategies for black-start capability of type-3 and -4 wind energy conversion subsystems, respectively; (ii) a high-fidelity wind-dominant power system simulation model incorporating information from a weather and research forecasting model and accepting external breaker commands by an artificial restoration director; (iii) a method to design an artificial director who can orchestrate the restoration of a wind-dominant power system with proof of concept; (iv) a method to determine the size of battery energy storage in wind energy systems for black start; and (v) new knowledge to teach and to enrich the literature of wind energy science."

Nanostructured porous tungsten (W) PFCs can provide one possible platform to deliver Li to the surface in a controlled manner compared to fast-flowing liquid Li approaches that carry with them intrinsic risk and safety concerns. We will investigate a robust architected porous W interface that can introduce small amounts of Li whereby the first few microns is permeated with Li by 100% wetting of W surfaces provided by nanopatterned structures designed to maximize Li wettability. A multi-institutional team consisting of three universities will advance the science of liquid-metal (LM) research in NSTX-U for architected porous refractory metal substrates used with liquid Li PFCs. The focus of this project is on surface science research and liquid metal plasma-facing component development in the NSTX-U. Lithium-based LMs (e.g. Li, Li-Sn alloy) and candidate porous W substrate materials will be studied and developed over the course of the project. This research will also identify optimized porous W architectures ultimately providing sample modules for testing in NSTX-U plasma environments and future designs for possible deployment in NSTX-U. The collaborative team is organized as follows: 1) Dr. J. P. Allain of Penn State University will lead the development of novel engineered refractory-metal substrates that can enhance LM interaction and study the dynamics of wettability of the LM on these substrates; 2) Dr. B. E. Koel of Princeton University will lead studies of fundamental properties of LM PFCs including surface chemistry at temperatures seen and foreseen in NSTX-U; and 3) Dr. K. B.

They are designed to be self-regulating autonomous systems that do not require a large number of on-site staff. To realize the full benefits of autonomous operation, microreactors need online monitoring systems that provide continuous performance verification of critical components at a level of automation that is not available today in the nuclear industry. In addition, microreactor process conditions are harsher relative to existing light water reactors, and existing nuclear sensors may not be capable of withstanding the long-term effects of these stressors in a microreactor. To avoid frequent sensor replacement as a result of calibration drift or premature degradation, durable alternative sensor technologies must be identified and evaluated for microreactor applications. To facilitate the safe and efficient deployment of microreactors, a research and development effort is proposed involving the testing of sensors and embedded instruments that could be installed within microreactors and used in conjunction with an online monitoring system that verifies the health of critical components. In support of this system, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other advanced analysis techniques will be identified and developed specifically for microreactor applications. This work will result in an online monitoring system to support remote autonomous microreactor operations. The Phase I work successfully demonstrated the feasibility of employing artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to provide identification and diagnosis of sensor and process anomalies using data from a variety of sources. In addition, the Phase I work highlighted the challenges associated with existing instrumentation to provide embedded sensor measurements and structural health monitoring. The research and development effort proposed herein will employ a hands-on approach to include demonstration of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to identify, diagnose, and predict sensor and/or process anomalies, experimental laboratory work to characterize the static and dynamic performance of process and non-process sensors that may be used in microreactors, and development of an online monitoring system that can provide real-time condition assessment of microreactors and inform decision-making of the autonomous control system. The results of this project will support the development and deployment of microreactors in the United States and the export of American microreactor technologies to other countries. The results will be broadly applicable to microreactors, advanced reactors, small modular reactors, and the existing nuclear fleet for improved in-situ sensor performance verification as well as process and component health monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics."

High energy ball milling and exposure to energetic heavy ion beams are two material processing methods that rapidly impart massive amounts of energy into small volumes, yielding material states that are otherwise not accessible. The innovative strategy of this project involves the application of neutron total scattering experiments, coupled with advanced modeling, to investigate the nature of structural disorder in far-from-equilibrium processed complex oxides over a range of length-scales. This approach presents a significant improvement over conventional long-range characterization techniques, utilizing X-ray and electron probes, that are less sensitive to anion sublattices and the unique aperiodic, short-range structural features produced by extreme processing conditions. For many physical properties in oxide materials, such as oxygen conductivity in fuel cell electrolytes, elucidation of oxygen behavior over short-range length scales is paramount. Our research performed over the past three years has revealed that defect behavior and disorder in mechanically milled and ion irradiated ceramics is far more complex than previously thought, with locally ordered structural motifs that are arranged such that the average, long-range structure does not represent the actual atomic configuration. The disordering process appears to be decoupled across structural length scales, proceeding locally at different rates than over longer length scales. This finding is important as the formation of disorder is inherent to many energy-related applications under which materials must perform in harsh conditions, such as nuclear materials as well as electrolyte and catalyst materials. Now that we have identified how and why short-range order forms in far-from-equilibrium phases, we propose, during the next three years, to follow a ""bottom-up"" strategy to unravel the interaction mechanisms between short-range structural building blocks which create medium-range order over the mesoscale. Using pyrochlore and other fluorite-derived oxides as model systems, this project will utilize high-energy ball milling and ion irradiation to produce well-defined metastable phases with a range of disorder and defect structures. Systematic analysis of the structural behavior with coupled experiments and modeling will identify the underlying processes that drive the formation of intricate disorder across all material length scales. This research project will not only help to build a robust atomic- and meso-scale understanding of highly defective and disordered phases but will also show how far-from-equilibrium processing techniques can be used to induce specific atomic arrangements and tailor physical properties (e.g., oxygen transport) to enhance functionality in technological applications (e.g., solid oxide fuel cells)."

Results from the preceding DOE Early Career Research Program award was understanding that actinide covalency for the transplutonium actinides appears to increase due to increasing orbital energy driven degeneracy covalency between the actinide f-orbitals and the ligand orbitals. This current work focuses on actinide interactions with aminopolycarboxylate ligands.The research effort for the next three years aims to expand this effort both in the types of ligands considered, electronic manipulation of a previously considered ligand, dipicolinic acid (DPA), and initiating efforts to couple a direct experimental method of quantifying metal-ligand covalency, K-edge spectroscopy, with the stability constant and computational interpretation that was ongoing during the previous funding period. This effort will consider a variety of DPA derivatives and sulfur donating complexants to better understand how ligand electronic structure impacts actinide reactivity. Regarding DPA derivatives, some literature reports indicate actinide-lanthanide selectivity can be inverted if nitrogen heterocycles are functionalized with hydroxyl groups in various positions. Regarding sulfur donating extractants, several reports have indicated mixed extraction systems, which contain both a sulfur donating extractant and a solvating, oxygen donating extractant (e.g. tributyl phosphate), can provide increased selectivity than if just the sulfur donating extractant is used alone. In both cases, the frameworks to describe these interactions are completely lacking. Aqueous soluble thioacetate reagents will also be considered in this study as a natural extension of the aminopolycarboxylate work considered previously and is the closest experimental control available for comparing the interactions of nitrogen versus sulfur containing reagents."

Xu, The Pennsylvania State University (Co-Investigator) Objectives: This project integrates computational simulation, software development, and experimental validation to accelerate the insertion of quantum materials into devices. The key to advance the understanding of materials is to predict their properties and responses on various time and length scales. The ability to predict, understand, and control the spatiotemporal evolution of materials at the mesoscale - that is, the scale between the atomistic and macroscopic lengths - is critical to translating novel quantum observations into practical technologies. The specific objectives of the proposed program are to: (1) explore and understand the thermodynamic stability of mesoscale structures and their responses to external thermal, mechanical, electric, and magnetic stimuli; (2) develop mesoscale computational models and innovative numerical algorithms to expand these algorithms towards exascale computations, and implement them into a corresponding open-source software for understanding, discovering and manipulating emergent mesoscale architectures and phenomena in quantum materials, and (3) experimentally validate and then refine the theory and computational tools using atom-resolution materials synthesis in tandem with cutting-edge quantum characterization methods. Description of methods: This project will leverage and further develop the predictive ability of the phase-field method, which has emerged as a powerful approach to model and simulate hierarchical mesoscale structures between the elementary atoms and the macroscopic continuum. The essential physics of strongly correlated electrons, topologically driven spin, charge, orbital and lattice textures, and their dynamical response to ultrafast signals and applied fields will be incorporated into the computational phase-field method that can predict emergent mesoscale quantum orders and pattern formations from the femtosecond (a millionth of a trillionth of a second) to long time scales of seconds or more. This proposal is based on nearly three decades of work by the lead PI in developing state-of-the-art phase-field simulation tools and software and in collaborating with experimental groups to model strongly correlated electron systems, topologically nontrivial polar vortex and bubble states, magnetic skyrmions, and multiferroic spin devices. Their collaborative computational and experimental efforts have recently led to the first dynamical phase-field model for predicting and understanding ultrafast phenomena in optical pump-probe experiments. The project brings together an interdisciplinary team of experts in mesoscale phase-field modeling (Chen), advanced numerical algorithms and high-performance computing (Xu), materials thermodynamic database development based on electronic structure calculations (Dabo), and experimental validation using finite-temperature measurements involving nonlinear optical microscopy, scanning probe microscopy and diffraction imaging (Gopalan), as well as cutting-edge materials synthesis using molecular beam epitaxy (Engel-Herbert). The project will involve extensive collaborations with other experts on dynamical mean field theory, crystal growth, and experimental characterization of mesoscale structures of quantum materials at several DOE Labs and a number of academic institutions. Potential impacts: One of the primary outcomes of the proposed project is an experimentally validated open source software package, open Q-&micro;-PRO, parallelized to enable peta- and exascale computing for understanding and predicting quantum materials and their mesoscale responses to external thermal, chemical, electrical, magnetic, and mechanical stimuli towards designing device architectures for harnessing these functionalities. The open source software Q-&micro;-PRO will harness the full potential of DOE leadership computing facilities. The proposed open software package will not only become a powerful tool for understanding the mesoscale phenomena in strongly correlated electronic materials but also accelerate materials insertion into quantum devices, such as strongly correlated materials for next generation field effect transistors, novel spin textures for spintronics, and superconducting qubits for quantum computing."

However, most computational approaches to materials design address zero-temperature properties, since finite-temperature calculations are still too complex and too resource-intensive to be integrated in high-throughput workflows. For example, today it is possible to compute the ground-state energy of solids for materials libraries including thousands of compounds, but we cannot do likewise for the electrical conductivity or the light absorption coefficient of solids. To enhance the predictive power and the technological and societal impact of computational materials design and discovery, we must fill this knowledge gap. The overarching aim of this project is to address this challenge and to introduce temperature as a new dimension in materials design. To achieve this goal we will leverage recent advances in first-principles calculations of electron-phonon interactions and related materials properties, including temperature-dependent band structures, temperature-dependent carrier mobilities and conductivities, and temperature-dependent optical absorption and luminescence in solids. On the theory front, we will develop new computational approaches to electron-phonon couplings and finite-temperature materials design starting from a general and rigorous many-body field-theoretic framework. On the software front, we will enhance the predictive power, the usability, automation, scalability, and interoperability of the EPW code, a leading open-source software for the study of electron-phonon interactions and phonon-mediated quantum processes. In this program we will expand the range of finite-temperature properties that can be computed with EPW, we will refactor the code to harness the full potential of DOE pre-exascale computing facilities and prepare for the exascale transition, and we will streamline computational workflows to enable high-throughput materials design. All developments will be shared with the community by developing exclusively open-source code, and by adopting a transparent development model based on revision control with publicly accessible repositories. This project will augment the Materials Genome Initiative and the available software infrastructure for data-driven materials discovery and design, and will enable tackling a broader array of materials design challenges by investigating materials properties at experimentally-relevant temperatures. The long-term ambition of this endeavor is to empower the community with a tool for massively-parallel, autonomous, and predictive calculations of electron-phonon couplings and derived materials properties, with an emphasis on the functional properties of designer materials for post-Moore electronics, solar photovoltaics, and energy-efficient lighting."
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation: Key Drivers and Climate Impacts,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019492,"Kwon, Young-Oh",Young-Oh.Kwon@woodsholeoceanographicinstitution,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation: Key Drivers and Climate Impacts Young-Oh Kwon, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Lead Principal Investigator) Claude Frankignoul, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Co-Investigator) Jian Lu, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) The Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV, also called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, AMO), the leading mode of low-frequency SST variability in the Atlantic Ocean, has been shown to impact a wide spectrum of earth system ranging from Atlantic hurricanes to fish distribution. Given its inherent scientific value as well as its enormous socio-economic implications, it is in great demand to enhance process-level understanding of the AMV and to identify its predictability. However, the effort towards this end has been challenging primarily due to the multidecadal time scale and the intricate interactions among various subcomponents of the climate system involved in the AMV, not to mention the limited observation-the key bottleneck for advancing the understanding. Some studies identify the ocean circulation, primarily the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, as the main driver of the AMV, while others argue that the AMV is predominantly driven by random atmospheric noise. Aerosol or solar radiative forcing has also been suggested as the key driver of the AMV. These different views imply not only very different physical processes, but also drastically different predictive skills of the AMV and its impact. For example, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is deemed to be the most predictable source of the decadal variability, while predictability arising from random atmospheric noise is very limited. The AMV is primarily considered as a mode of internal climate variability stemming from coupled ocean-atmosphere interaction, which may evolve as the climate changes. However, external radiative forcings are also likely to contribute to the multidecadal SST variability, and they must be distinguished from the natural AMV variability. Some of the previous inferences on the role of the external forcing were highly dependent on the choice of model, suggesting a multi-model approach to properly advance our understanding. Importantly, these key drivers co-exist and their roles are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they are timescale-dependent and geographically varying, with feedbacks between different drivers. Therefore, we need a systematic modeling approach to quantify the relative importance of different AMV drivers, to understand the feedback between them, to clearly identify AMV impacts, and to assess its future evolution as the climate system changes. We propose to investigate the AMV using a hierarchical modeling framework to advance our process-level understanding on the respective roles of, and the feedback between, the key drivers of the AMV, in particular the ocean circulation associated with the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and random atmospheric noise, which is primarily due to the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation. The focus will be primarily on the AMV due to natural variability, but the investigation will be extended to the possible modulation of the main characteristics of the AMV under external climate forcing. Furthermore, we will examine the impact of the AMV, with a special emphasis on the possible augmentation of predictability that the AMV may bring to the regional weather and climate of North America, Western Europe, and the Arctic. Based on the improved dynamical understanding of the key drivers and impacts of AMV, a set of metrics for the AMV will be developed to assess the DOE&rsquo;s E3SM v.1 among the latest generation of earth system models."

The current state of the art for ab initio MD is to describe the molecular interactions using density functional theory (DFT), due to DFT's reasonable compromise between accuracy and computational cost. However, the chemical sciences are permeated with systems for which the approximations of DFT fundamentally break down or for which the computational cost of DFT remains prohibitive for the MD simulation of necessary length- and timescales. The planned research will use quantum embedding strategies to move ``beyond DFT"" in both key dimensions of higher accuracy and lower computational cost, thereby bringing broad new chemical and materials application domains within the reach of ab initio MD simulation. The research will pursue theoretical innovations that include coupling highly correlated system wavefunction methods with DFT environments, transferable machine-learning methods for electronic structure, and non-adiabatic dynamics methods based on the Feynman path-integral framework. The work will address frontier chemical challenges ranging from non-adiabatic dynamics through conical intersections in metalloenzymes, to biological transport of energy and charge, to coupled electron-nuclear quantum dynamics in surface reactions. The new simulation capabilities will be implemented in open-source, high-performance and developer friendly packages.

The planned work is particularly well aligned with targeted focus areas that include multi-scale (i.e., embedding) methods for describing natural and artificial photochemistry for solar driven energy conversion and storage, approaches to account for competing dissipative mechanisms (decoherence or other non-idealities) in molecular systems, and methods for modeling molecular complexes composed of interfaces."
The Multi-Plume Eddy-Diffusivity/Mass-Flux (EDMF) Unified Parameterization: Stratocumulus and the Transition to Cumulus Boundary Layers,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019242,"Teixeira, Joao","Joao.Teixeira@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,losangeles","['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","The objective of this project is to reduce the subtropical boundary layer cloud deficiencies and biases in oceanic upwelling regions by implementing, and evaluating, in E3SM a new unified boundary layer and convection parameterization based on the multi-plume Eddy-Diffusivity/Mass-Flux (EDMF) approach. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reiterated that clouds remain the largest source of uncertainty in climate projections. Studies have shown that subtropical boundary layer clouds are a primary reason for this model spread. Over the subtropical oceans, the prevalent cloud regimes are stratocumulus and shallow cumulus, capped by subsiding warm and dry air in the free troposphere. Stratocumulus is prevalent over the cool upwelling waters off the west coast of continents while cumulus is common over warmer subtropical waters. What controls the existence of these cloud regimes and the transition between them is still a matter of debate. This transition from stratocumulus to cumulus plays a key role in cloud-climate feedbacks because of the essential difference in terms of albedo between the two regimes. Current climate and weather prediction models (including E3SM) have difficulties in realistically simulating stratocumulus and the transition to cumulus, and its oceanic and climate impact in terms of cloud albedo and sea surface temperature (SST). The EDMF parameterization has been shown to improve the representation of the subtropical cloudy boundary layer, including cumulus and stratocumulus. Eddy-Diffusivity/Mass-Flux (EDMF): The EDMF approach is based on the unification of concepts generally used for the parameterization of turbulence in the boundary layer (ED) and of moist convection (MF). The EDMF approach was first proposed by Siebesma and Teixeira (Proc. PBL AMS, 2000) and has been shown to represent well dry (Siebesma et al., J. Atmos. Sci., 2007) and moist convective boundary layers (Soares et al., Quart. J. Roy. Meteor. Soc., 2004). In the last few years the PI&rsquo;s group has developed a new version of EDMF that is particularly well suited to simulate moist convective boundary layers and is able to represent in a realistic manner the dry boundary layer, stratocumulus, shallow and deep cumulus convection, and the transitions between these different regimes. This new version (Suselj et al., J. Atmos. Sci., 2013) uses a multi-plume approach where (1) cloud base or surface variability of updraft properties is parameterized using a simple diagnostic variance equation; (2) these probability density functions (PDFs) of updraft properties are sampled with a Monte-Carlo method; and (3) lateral entrainment is parameterized in a stochastic manner (Romps and Kuang, J. Atmos. Sci., 2011). This new EDMF parameterization is scale-adaptive: (i) the updraft area term in the full EDMF decomposition of the subgrid vertical fluxes is not neglected (as is often done); and (ii) the number of plumes can be made dependent on the grid size by taking into account the typical convective cell size versus grid size. E3SM implementation: In this project, we will implement and evaluate the new EDMF parameterization in the E3SM model. During the first half of the project, we will implement, and evaluate, the new EDMF into the E3SM Single Column Model (SCM), versus a variety of LES case-studies and observations from the ARM MAGIC field experiment. For the full 3D implementation, we will focus our evaluation on cloud and convection variables as observed by satellite instruments during present climate. In particular, we will evaluate how the new EDMF version of E3SM is able to simulate stratocumulus and the transition to cumulus clouds. We will also investigate the impact, and feedback, of the new EDMF E3SM simulations in the sea surface temperature off the west coast of continents (in a coupled model context)."

A better understanding of how to control the potential energy of charge separation and the duration of photoinduced charge separations at interfaces is needed for solar-to-electric and solar-to-fuel systems. The lack of a set of design principles for photoactive components in large potential energy charge separation systems is currently limiting the development of many solar-to-electric and solar-to-fuel systems. Basic understanding of large potential energy photoinduced charge separations across interfaces is needed for the full potential energy use of the highest energy photons provided by sunlight. This project seeks to address the fundamental knowledge required to enable solar-to-electric and solar-to-fuel systems access to efficient use of sunlight. Research will focus on synthesizing tailored molecules specifically to generate large potential energy charge separations at organic-inorganic material interfaces. Rational molecular design principles will be put forward through this research that could enable the rapid design of next generation solar conversion systems.

By combining information from femtosecond multidimensional electronic spectroscopy and ultrasensitive fluorescence spectroscopy, we have been able to detect the processes that photosynthetic organisms use to capture energy from solar photons and to transfer the energy along efficient pathways to photosynthetic reaction centers, where the captured energy is converted to stored forms of energy that the organism can use in biosynthetic chemical reactions. Our efforts in this project so far during the first three terms of support have distinguished the nature of the ultrafast excitation energy transfer and nonradiative decay mechanisms used by carotenoids when incorporated in light-harvesting proteins. These studies have provided an improved understanding of the role of intramolecular charge transfer and conformational processes in carbonyl-substituted carotenoids: in the peridinin–chlorophyll protein, a light-harvesting protein from marine dinoflagellates, and in the orange carotenoid protein, which serves as a light and color sensor in cyanobacteria that initiates a photoprotective response. In the next term of support, we will extend what we have learned about carotenoids to a new focus on the excitation energy transfer and photoregulatory mechanisms involving the bilin (linear tetrapyrrole) chromophores in the phycobilisome, which serves as the principal light-harvesting system in cyanobacteria. We have demonstrated using multidimensional electronic spectroscopy that it is possible to follow the pathways that transfer excitation energy from the peripheral rod structures to the core of the phycobilisome, which then transfers excitation energy to photosynthetic reaction centers in the thylakoid membrane to which the phycobilisome is attached. A central goal of the planned work is to determine how vibrational motions that twist or bend the bilin chromophores result in intramolecular charge transfer, which is expected to produce localized excitations and red-absorbing trapping sites in the core of the phycobilisome. Additionally, we plan to determine how binding of the photoactivated form of the orange carotenoid protein to the core of the phycobilisome results in quenching of excitation energy. Overall, our efforts increasingly point towards applying advanced photophysical methods to determine how intact assemblies of light-harvesting proteins work in nature. We expect that this work will provide crucial insight into how to make smart light-harvesting and photocatalytic materials for use in solar energy capture and conversion to electricity and fuels."

This project aims to elucidate the essential processes by which chloroplasts dynamically balance their energy budget to cope with these fluctuations, optimizing energy capture while avoiding toxic side reactions. A major obstacle to understanding processes of energy balancing is that the full complexity of fluctuations in nature cannot be recreated in the laboratory. Instead, previous work introduced methods to probe photosynthetic processes in detail under field conditions, revealing new behaviors not seen in the laboratory that are likely to be critical for maintaining robust and efficient photosynthesis. Once these behaviors are identified from field data, they are emulated in the laboratory, allowing us to apply specialized instruments that explore their mechanisms in detail. Ongoing work will take this approach in the following inquiries: 1) We observed that the rapid photoprotective mechanism known as the qE response “freezes out” at even mildly decreased temperatures. A series of possible models can now be tested to explain which process fails. 2) Under rapidly fluctuating light, we found evidence that recombination, i.e., the reversal of light-induced electron transfer, occurs at high rates in photosystems. We will now test hypotheses for the mechanism of this effect in Photosystem I (PS I) 3) We will also test whether the PSI recombination reaction represents a photoprotective mechanism or results in photodamaging singlet oxygen production, explaining the sensitivity of PSI to fluctuating light; 4) We will test the impacts of complex leaf-level light fluctuations, as experienced by leaves under real world conditions, on these processes and subsequent photodamage."
"Predicting post-fire N cycling through traits and cross-kingdom interactions

Unlike ecosystem disturbances that primarily impact vegetation, wildfires kill microbes, thereby dramatically altering the composition, function, and abundance of post-fire soil microbiomes, with downstream impacts on soil nitrogen (N) cycling. Post-fire environments favor pyrophilous microbes, meaning “fire-loving” microbes that are undetectable pre-fire but vastly increase in abundance post-fire. While we know that fire can select for increased abundance of pyrophilous microbes, their traits and impacts on soil nutrient cycling remain largely unknown. Here, we focus on how wildfire severity and pyrophilous microbial interactions regulate N cycling and the emission of greenhouse gases. In particular, we examine impacts on nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas with 300x the warming potential of carbon dioxide, and its implications for long-term ecosystem recovery and Earth’s climate. Understanding how microbial interactions and their traits govern N cycling is critical to predict post-fire N behavior and ecosystem recovery, leading us to ask the overarching question: Do conserved microbial traits and cross-kingdom interactions drive post-fire N cycling across ecosystems? We ask these questions across scales, from individual genomes to more complex microbiomes, allowing us to predict the impacts of wildfire disturbance on ecosystem N cycling with a modeling approach that incorporates microbial traits. We ask our questions across three ecosystems (Mediterranean grasslands, chaparral shrublands, and montane coniferous forests) that are experiencing increased fire frequency and are abundant across Western North America and many other parts of the globe. We ask: 1) How do microbial traits change during post-fire succession? 2) How does fire severity influence microbial succession and gene expression of N cycling functions? 3) How do cross-kingdom interactions change during post-fire succession? 4) How do traits and interactions affect ecosystem N fates and cycling? To answer these questions, we will 1) identify traits and interactions among archaea, bacteria, fungi, and viruses that affect N cycling genes and biogeochemistry in all three ecosystems using DNA sequencing datasets and laboratory experiments; 2) test and refine these insights through experiments with highly controlled and replicable fires in “pyrocosms” to simulate soil heating; and 3) scale up microbial traits and interactions to the ecosystem level by integrating our measurements with a computational model that accounts for microbial behaviors that impact N cycling. Microbiological insights assessed via advanced genomics sequencing techniques of both DNA to examine who is there and RNA to examine their functions will be paired with biogeochemical approaches that combine laboratory assays with isotopic measurements to track the production and consumption of compounds involved in greenhouse gas emissions. Experimental approaches and modeling will span microbial kingdoms and even domains (archaea, bacteria, fungi, and viruses) and diverse fire-impacted ecosystems to assess how our results can be extrapolated at broad spatial and temporal scales. Recent catastrophic wildfires have alarmed scientists, policymakers, land managers, and the public, and there is growing public awareness of the role of microbiomes in human and environmental systems. The need to understand how soil microbiomes respond to fire severity and change over time has never been more urgent. Wildfires affect global biogeochemical cycling, and can increase greenhouse gas emissions, which are mediated by soil microbiomes and microbial interactions. Our project will train early-career scientists to provide critical information on the traits of pyrophilous microbes and improve predictions of fire impacts on N cycling and greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously identifying unifying controls of microbial response to wildfire. The knowledge produced in this proposal can be leveraged to improve management of post-fire landscapes, which are increasingly common with environmental change."

Valeev, Virginia Tech (Principal Investigator) Robert J. Harrison, Stony Brook University (Co-Investigator) Deborah A. Penchoff, University of Tennessee (Co-Investigator) The vast importance of heavy elements for energy production and storage, classical and quan- tum information processing, and enabling chemical transformations, as well as the environmental impacts thereof, underscores the critical need for understanding and controlling the electrons in heavy-element-containing molecules and materials. Unfortunately, our ability to predict the behavior of electrons in heavy-element matter is severely hampered by the limitations of the traditional numerical representations used to describe relativistic quantum states of electrons in heavy elements. This project will remove the bottlenecks in modeling the electrons in such systems predictively by employing non-traditional real-space numerical representations. To achieve these goals this project’s team will build on their recent breakthroughs in the real-space numerical simulation of electrons that demonstrated its unrivaled ability to model electrons with better numerical precision than achievable by fixed atomic orbital basis sets that are typically employed in simulating electrons in molecules. This project will extend these efforts to the simulation of correlated electronic motion in heavy-element compounds. For the first time these developments will permit to approach a nearly exact numerical description of relativistic electrons in heavy-element-containing molecules. This will provide crucial benchmarks for more approximate methods, as well as enable predictive simulation of chemistry and spectroscopy of heavy-element compounds, such as the proposed model compounds for separating mixtures of lanthanides and actinides that will be studied in this project. To fulfill the promise of the novel simulation methods developed in this project, they will be implemented in publicly-available open-source software that can be deployed to modern high- performance computing platforms, such as the leadership-class computing facilities of the Department of Energy (DOE), including the exascale supercomputers soon to be deployed by the DOE’s Exascale Computing Initiative . The ability to execute on modern computing platforms will be essential to accommodate the extra cost of the relativistic description of the quantum electrons in molecules and to allow simulation of realistic (i.e., sufficiently large) molecular models of experimental separations platforms."
Driving Selectivity Among Rare Earth Elements through Phase Modifiers,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022217,"Jensen, Mark",Mark.Jensen@coloradoschoolofmines,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","“Driving Selectivity Among Rare Earth Elements through Phase Modifiers” Mark P. Jensen, Colorado School of Mines (Principal Investigator:) Jenifer C. Shafer, Colorado School of Mines (Co-Investigator) Aurora E. Clark, Washington State University (Co-Investigator) Stosh A. Kozimor, Los Alamos National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) The rare earth elements play increasingly vital roles in modern electronic, optical, and green energy technologies due to their unique electronic, magnetic, and nuclear properties. Despite their importance in energy and technology applications, the pure rare earth materials required for advanced energy applications are difficult to produce, and the cost structure of their production has left the nation reliant on foreign rare earth supplies. In the face of the increasing demand for critical rare earth elements, a key domestic strategy to address this vulnerability is to simplify rare earth production. Separation of rare earths from ores or recycled materials is the primary driver for the difficulty and cost of their production. The state-of-the-art molecules for rare earth separations rely on small energy differences between chemical compounds of different rare earths. These poorly selective separations require hundreds of repeated stages of separation by liquid-liquid (solvent) extraction to isolate a particular rare earth. Decades of work designing new molecules to separate rare earth elements have not improved their separation efficiency. This work explores a different approach to addressing the critical challenge of separating rare earths. Instead of relying on the strength of bonding interactions between rare earths and extracting molecules to create the separation, the strategy under investigation involves modifying the properties of the organic solvent in which the extracting molecules are dissolved to achieve selectivity among the rare earth species. The approach involves using a co-solvent, called a phase modifier, to tune the properties of the solvent and thereby control the separation of supply-critical rare earths through two possible mechanisms. The first mechanism depends on the recent discoveries that water molecules and counter anions are present at the periphery of particular rare earth-extracting molecule aggregates and that the peripheral water-anion interactions in these aggregates are correlated with the capacity of the system to separate rare earths. It is hypothesized that adding polar phase modifiers affects these peripheral interactions and can substantially boost the thermodynamic selectivity of the separation for a given rare earth. The second mechanism involves kinetic selectivity. It arises because phase modifiers can accumulate at the aqueous/organic interface in these separations. Interactions at the aqueous-organic interface typically control rare earth extraction rates. It is hypothesized that the accumulation of phase modifier molecules at the interface will change the step-wise chemical mechanism of the extraction reaction, enhancing the extraction kinetics of desired rare earths. The number of combinations of organic solvent–phase modifier–extracting molecule–rare earth–anion–concentration that need to be studied to understand the action of phase modifiers is enormous; therefore this work employs an automated high-throughput system to measure separations for hundreds of conditions every day, and to combine that information with the existing literature to generate large data sets on phase modifier effects that will be studied with machine learning algorithms to deduce optimal phase modifier systems. Development of phase modifiers as a tool to control the selectivity of rare earth separations has the potential to enable high-efficiency separations of rare earths that are not possible today. It also represents a strategy that could be readily applied to other difficult metal separations."
Moire Excitons for Quatum Information Science,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021984,"Dionne, Jennifer",Jennifer.Dionne@boardoftrusteesofthelelandstanfordjunioruniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Future quantum information systems will crucially rely on generating solid-state qubits with controlled positioning, local addressability, and long coherence lifetimes. These criteria can be met by moiré excitons – atom-like correlated electron-hole pairs that emerge from the potential energy landscape of two misaligned two-dimensional van der Waals materials. Moiré exciton qubits can be localized at precise locations within the crystal, are stable at high temperatures, and exhibit strong light-matter interactions. Additionally, two types of optically-controlled qubits are possible: the exciton occupancy state, and the valley state - the latter arising from strong spin-orbit coupling and broken inversion symmetry in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) lattices.. Moiré excitons were only recently identified, and our understanding is still evolving rapidly. From the features that are already understood, this platform offers many new possibilities for advancing the frontiers of quantum information science. These include the creation of new interlayer exciton qubits with greatly extended lifetimes and coherence times, the possibility of the creation of arrays of gate-tunable qubits in a scalable, highly tunable solid-state platform, and a platform for tunable quantum emitters, super-radiant emitters, and a potential source of entangled photon pairs for communication and transduction. We have assembled an integrated, collaborative team of 7 research leaders who leverage expertise in condensed-matter theory, atomically-precise materials synthesis, multi-scale in-situ characterization, and quantum photonic systems. Team members include Profs. J. Dionne (lead PI), D. Goldhaber-Gordon, F. Jornada, and A. Mannix at Stanford; Profs. T. Heinz and E. Nanni at SLAC, and Prof. A. MacDonald at U.T. Austin. Our team of physicists, chemists, materials scientists, and engineers will connect first principles calculations with experimental insights emerging from atomic-scale optical qubit characterization, ultrafast electron diffraction, and ultrasensitive scanning probe measurements. These computational and characterization methods will in turn inform the design and fabrication of novel TMD heterostructures and integrated quantum optical systems exhibiting long coherence times, high-efficiency photon pair generation, and low-noise transduction. Our project is organized into three aims that each span multiple investigators and institutional partners. In Aim 1, “large-area, uniform moiré lattices,” we will use first-principles calculations to predict moiré exciton properties, synthesize moiré lattices using novel methods of 2D materials growth and van der Waals heterostructure assembly, and advance atomic-scale and ultrafast optical characterization to accelerate discovery. In Aim 2, “electrically-gated moiré excitons and biexcitons” we will develop electrical tuning to utilize moiré excitons as qubits, addressing them individually and in parallel, in order to implement initialization, gating, and read-out protocols. We will develop first-principles theory and experiment to locally gate excitons, develop scalable fabrication to independently address multiple individual interlayer exciton qubits, and use electrical control of biexcitons to enable entangled photon pair production. Finally, in Aim 3, “optically-pumped coherent state transfer and transduction,” we will develop all-optical, spin-selective schemes to enable coherent state transfer between photons, excitons, and phonons. Using the valley degree of freedom, will we demonstrate high-yield emission of single photons, transduction and long-range entanglement, aided by high-quality-factor cavities that overcome loss of valley polarization due to phonon-assisted valley coupling. Our vision is bold: we see the possibility to revolutionize the materials framework for quantum information systems with deterministically positioned, optically addressable, and gate-tunable solid-state qubits for quantum communications. These goals are strongly resonant with three of the DOE priority research opportunities from the Quantum System Roundtable Report: PRO-1 to advance artificial quantum-coherent systems with unprecedented functionality, PRO-2 to enhance creation and control of coherence, and PRO-3 to discover novel approaches for transduction. Through our team’s interdisciplinary, integrated efforts moiré materials will be poised to enable high-fidelity distributed quantum networks of sensors, communication, and computing systems."

This calls for advanced NPP Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) technology to achieve sustainable NPP electricity generation and supply in a safe and economic way. However, current approaches are still limited for such a capability evidenced by the recent NPP shutdowns, e.g., Duke Energy’s Oconee Nuclear Station Unit 2 in 2022. To fill this gap, InfoBeyond propose SafeCBM (NPP Safety-constrained CBM Optimization & Diagnosis) to provide cost-effective Predictive Maintenance capability subject to NPP strict safety and reliability constraints. SafeCBM enables condition-based monitoring with dynamic-scheduled inspection for NPP components. For such a purpose, SafeCBM defines new equipment and materials classifications based on International Standard ISO 15926 standardized information models to enhance the results of risk-based CBM (Condition-Based Maintenance) optimization. Next, deep learning models using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neuron networks is proposed to predict the equipment RUL (Reminding Useful Lifetime) to indicate when the equipment will fail or the failure probability at the given future time. Finally, a CBM optimization model with NPP safety constraints assuming imperfect inspection is constructed to provide optimal maintenance policies. Such a policy is based on optimal maintenance cost CBM probability before a component’s lifetime failure occurs. For practicability of maintenance decision, the proposed optimization model, which minimizes the expected long-term cost rate with safety constraints, also considers the influence of imperfect inspection. SafeCBM is the first safety-integrated PHM solution that leverages AI-based process automation, machine intelligence, and computer aided decision making for NPP modernization that enhances both core operations and PHM activities. Business Benefits: SafeCBM achieves several impressive benefits: Conditional Monitoring/CBM Enhancement: SafeCBM can enhance the plant’s CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management Systems) performance by minimizing overall maintenance cost, improving PLiM (Plant Life Management), and increasing process productivity, all while integrating NPP safety constraints and dynamic inspection scheduling criteria. It considers plant safety constraints and measurement errors when calculating maintenance cost optimizations and strategies. It supports CBM decision-making by suggesting predictive correction of components and accessories likely to fail in the future. Advanced Oil, Gas, Power Plant and Other Energy Facility Maintenance: SafeCBM’s benefits can be extended to Oil & gas plants (e.g., Port Arthur Refinery), Hydroelectric plants (Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant), Coal, solar, and wind plants (e.g., Meadow Lake Wind Farm), power stations, and other energy facilities. Monitoring the health of machines effectively enables the users to schedule repair and maintenance of the system ensuring less downtime, thereby enhancing its lifetime and production volume. Industrial Machinery Maintenance and Facility Management & Maintenance: SafeCBM offers these facilities management/maintenance activities in terms of reliability, availability, and serviceability. SafeCBM ensures continuous facility operability in multi-tier aspects. Its optimal CBM model is able to integrate patient and staff equipment risk and link that risk to the equipment or area being serviced. It streamlines their facility and maintenance operations."

A significant remaining challenge is to process the MREO into individually separated, high purity (ISHP) REO powders (>99% purity). This is the next generation of goal of the DOE-NETL. GlycoSurf and its project partners Wayne State University and UCLA will continue to build on its Phase I successes using ligand-associated separation media to develop a new class of sorption media, and a process to separate individual rare earth elements resulting in individual high purity rare earth oxide (REO) powders. Phase I results showed that our media is capable of separating REEs from each other in a concentrated mixture of rare earths extracted from coal combustion residuals, or synthetic solutions that represent an acidified rare earth concentrate. During our Phase I project, we have validated our sequential separation approach and shown that our technology and techniques can produce high purity Sc in one pass through a packed-bed column, while producing significant separation among the remaining 15 naturally occurring REEs. We have preliminary data that establishes the capability to achieve similar results with other REEs using additional columns, which will be a major focus of our proposed Phase II project. During the first year of Phase II, GlycoSurf and its partners will (1) continue building on the proof-of- concept results from Phase I, to recover Sc first; then (2) develop a process to combine the bench-scale steps together to test the system components to advance the technology; and (3) work with our commercial partners to testing our ligand-bound sorbent media to produce individually separated rare earths. During the second year of the Phase II, our team will: (1) select a partner to collaboratively develop a mobile pilot- scale separation system using real world solutions, and (2) build, test, and begin operation of a fully- operational prototype capable of producing small quantities of individually separated high purity REOs. GlycoSurf anticipates that Phase II will result in produced materials with an REO purity >90% in less than 10 steps (as opposed to 100’s to 1000’s of steps for current liquid-liquid separations). Overall, our technology will demonstrate a potential cost savings of >20% compared to conventional commercial technologies."

These processes often rely on scarce precious metals and the rational design of optimal catalytic materials is hampered by the very complex structures of the catalysts themselves. Motivated by these issues there has been a surge of recent interest in catalysts composed of single precious metal atoms supported by oxides, called single atom catalysts (SACs), or by noble metals, called single atom alloys (SAAs). SAAs and SACs each present unique catalytic reactivity, but they are most effective when operated under different environmental conditions – generally, oxidizing for SACs and reducing conditions for SAAs. The central hypothesis explored in this research is that materials existing in the structural phase space between SAAs and SACs will allow distinct chemical reactivity for industrially important reactions, such as higher alcohol synthesis and the preferential oxidation of CO in H2-rich streams. The research will be focused on single Pt-group metal atom active sites on supports ranging in stoichiometry from metallic Cu to CuO. We will utilize a combined surface science and high surface area catalysis approach to understand the atomic-scale structure of active sites, how they evolve under reaction conditions, and thereby discover structure-function relationships. Ensuring a link between the surface science and catalysis studies in terms of the type and local coordination of the active site is key to understanding and ultimately controlling important catalytic processes. Collectively, this research will lead to the discovery of new catalyst formulations and the development of structure-function relationships that are essential for the heterogenous catalysis community in their quest to rationally design next generation atom-efficient catalysts."

Heating and cooling constitute approximately 48% of building energy consumption, representing a significant dollar cost to society. In addition, the vast majority of this energy is generated by fossil fuels, resulting in substantial environmental impacts. Geothermal heat pumps (GHP) represent the most energy-efficient and environmentally friendly heating and cooling solution currently available and the most favorable heating and cooling technology to support our country’s electrification efforts. Energy storage technologies could enable increased use of variable electricity generation by time- shifting excess production from when it is generated to when it is demanded. But most types of energy storage technologies cannot be used for large, grid-scale, applications and can only discharge energy at capacity for time lengths ranging from seconds to minutes. Moreover, they tend to be inefficient. Low temperature thermal energy storage in shallow geologic formations for building space and water heating and cooling overcomes many of the challenges of conventional energy storage approaches. Energy storage using GHP’s is highly efficient, widely applicable, very high capacity, and affordable. Moreover, GHP’s with thermal storage can help meet present challenges of grid resiliency. The present proposal will advance new, innovative GHP technology to allow for thermal energy storage in shallow reservoirs. This technology, termed the advective GHP (AGHP), fundamentally changes the manner in which heat is transferred with the shallow subsurface. The AGHP was modeled and tested successfully in a field trial in our DOE SBIR Phase I study, showing the potential of this approach to store and recover thermal energy in the shallow thermal subsurface for building heating/cooling. In the present Phase II proposal, a larger field test will be completed, in which a multi-well AGHP system will be tied to a building or series of buildings to provide thermal energy storage and recovery for 9-12 months. Following a successful Phase II investigation, the technology will be ready for commercial deployment with the ultimate goal to disrupt the conventional HVAC, GHP, and low temperature thermal energy storage industries; the annual US market size readily exceeds $8 billion with conservative projections."
Design and Structural Analyses of 2D COFs as Single-Site CO2 Reduction Catalysts,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020122,"Huang, Jier",Jier.Huang@marquetteuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","The capture of CO2 and its simultaneously conversion to useful chemical fuels driven by solar energy represents one of the best solutions to resolve growing energy concerns. Among the various strategies that are being considered, photocatalytic CO2 reduction is perhaps most attractive due to its simplicity and economy of the input energy source. The most critical challenge to this endeavor is the rational design of a phototocatalytic architecture that can effectively couple a given photosensitizer with an appropriate catalyst, thereby enabling efficient photosensitization of a multi-electron reduction catalysis. The objectives of this research are to address this challenge using an interdisciplinary approach that combines innovative material design and synthesis, fundamental mechanistic studies, and photocatalytic performance evaluation. These goals will be accomplished by 1) constructing a unique set of hybrid covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts with an effective photoactive organic building block as photosensitizer and a precisely incorporated CO2 reduction molecular catalyst; 2) examining the excited state and charge separation dynamics of these photocatalysts using a set of complementary time resolved spectroscopy to unravel the key factors that control their function as photocatalysts; and 3) investigating the photocatalytic performance, selectivity and catalytic pathways, and correlating them with photophysical properties to determine the structure-function relationship of these hybrid COF catalysts. This research will address current shortcomings of semiconductor- and molecular-based photocatalytic systems that suffer from inefficient light harvesting and charge separation and poor adsorption and activation of reactants. In turn, this research will contribute toward the development of novel photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction to generate renewable chemical fuels using sunlight as the only energy input."
Toughening Mechanisms in Ceramic Nanocomposites,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0018193,"Lou, Jun",Jun.Lou@williammarshriceuniversity,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Textbooks routinely tout the inherent advantages of ceramic materials for applications at high temperatures and in chemically aggressive surroundings. However, in practice the poor mechanical properties of ceramics (relative to metals) often prevent implementation in these types of harsh environments under mechanical loading. Thus, the research community has long focused on methods for improving these properties, particularly the fracture toughness. With this in mind the exceptional mechanical properties of some nanomaterials have led to efforts to produce new ceramic nanocompositematerials with substantially improved toughness. A number of these prior studies have now reported toughness improvements in carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced ceramics, and more recent studies have also shown evidence of even larger fracture toughness improvements in ceramic nanocomposites reinforced with graphene and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO). However, an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to increased toughness in these types of materials is lacking. In comparison with conventional ceramic composites, reducing the reinforcement dimensions by roughly two orders of magnitude leads to important new questions – in particular, the extent to which existing continuum mechanics laws are applicable. Because the scale over which fracture and decohesion occur are comparable to the reinforcement dimensions (e.g., nanotube diameter or number of graphene layers), phenomena at atomic or near-atomic length scales must now be carefully addressed. For example, in ceramic nanocomposites the idea of a distinct reinforcement-matrix interface must be reconsidered in light of the fact that the entire reinforcement is within a few atomic spacings of the matrix. Exploring the ways in which these inherently smaller size scales will impact toughening mechanisms is the central motivation of the work being pursued in this research program. Several different processing methods are being employed, to carefully control defects and other structural features. These well controlled materials are then being used to enable systematic investigations of toughening mechanisms that employin situmechanical testing capabilities that have been developed at both Brown and Rice Universities. This approach allows us to observe and monitor fracture mechanisms in ways that go well beyond prior studies. These experiments are also closely integrated with multiscale modeling efforts. Through this combination of careful processing, in situ mechanical testing, and detailed modeling, we expect to greatly expand the existing understanding of nanoscale toughening in ceramic nanocomposites."

Extreme particle and heat fluxes exceeding 10-20 MW/m2 drive traditional material surfaces out of equilibrium and induce topographical and compositional changes that can have deleterious effects on the plasma edge and, ultimately, fusion plasma confinement. Processing of refractory alloys is challenging, and it is uncertain if solid plasma facing components are a viable option for future fusion reactors. Plasma facing components coated in liquid metal (lithium) offer highly desirable properties that can address these issues. The approach combines advanced manufacturing technologies of both bulk tungsten and its surface to create a hybrid tungsten-liquid lithium material system that can survive and operate continuously in the extreme fusion environment without disturbing the fusion reaction. Phase I & Phase II work thus far has demonstrated the feasibility of small-scale manufacturing and use of fine-grain mesoporous tungsten in the HIDRA research fusion reactor with liquid lithium. Survival of the material, particle interactions with liquid lithium, and enhanced wetting have been demonstrated. Significant increases in plasma temperature and density due to lithium interactions have been observed. These benefits demonstrate that using the technology in a commercial fusion reactor would drastically reduce cost. Phase IIB will build on this success by address two remaining key aspects of the tungsten technology: scaling manufacturing and determining mechanical properties. Scaling is necessary to demonstrate manufacturing feasibility and to perform future testing in prototype commercial fusion reactors. Defining mechanical properties will enable component design and help estimate component lifetime. As the market for PFCs is not yet established, Phase IIB will demonstrate the tungsten-lithium system in a high-temperature heat pipe for near-term hypersonic vehicles to accelerate development and ensure readiness for commercial fusion reactors. Phase IIB development will deliver high-temperature heat pipes to provide advanced cooling solutions for hypersonic vehicles in the near term. The advances made in Phase IIB combined with early deployment in heat pipes will ultimately enable high-temperature radiation-resistant materials for plasma-facing components and contribute to the success of fusion energy. Fusion is an abundant, affordable, and clean energy source will help to avoid climate disaster in the long run and ensure energy security ."

Waldeck, University of Pittsburgh (Principal Investigator) D. Beratan, Duke University (Co-Investigator) The objective of this project is to explore design features, at the molecular and nanometer scales, that promote efficient charge and spin transfer in self-assembling materials. Control of charge and spin transfer in materials is essential for the function of energy capture and conversion devices, and may also enable new classes of materials of value in the electronics industry. The project builds on discoveries of the research team associated with the handedness or chirality of structures at the nanoscale and the influence of this handedness on charge and spin transport. The team brings together theoretical and experimental expertise to understand the function of novel and complex assemblies that use chirality to generate novel function. Substantial progress was made in the last grant period to determine how the structure and assembly of nanoparticles influence charge transport, revealing a rich interplay between the electronic density of states, chirality, and electronic structure. Importantly, the team discovered that the chirality of molecular and nanoscale objects can influence charge transport kinetics in surprising ways, and that the effects uncovered may confer beneficial new properties on the nanostructures. In the next grant period, the team will build upon these findings to explore how chiral molecules, chiral nanostructures, and circularly polarized light interact with one another to influence the polarization and transport of charge and spin at the nanoscale. This research program will use the richness and atomistic precision of chemistry to imprint chirality onto nanoscale objects in ways that influence charge and spin alignment and transport at multiple length scales. Chiral molecules and nanostructures can exhibit unusual electronic and magnetic properties, including electron spin filtering and directed charge transfer; but the underlying mechanism(s) giving rise to these properties are poorly understood. The objectives of our activities are to develop design principles to guide the study of chiral nanomaterials and to discover novel properties that emerge from the motion of electrons and spins in these structures. The proposed studies involve a rich interplay of theory and experiment. The project involves three major activities, described in these three tasks: · Task 1 will elucidate mechanisms to imprint chirality onto the electronic charge distributions in semiconductor nanoparticles. While considerable effort has been expended to establish strategies to synthesize and characterize chiral nanomaterials, fundamental studies into the physical mechanism(s) that underlie chiral imprinting are lacking. We use both experimental methods of fabricating nanoscale structures and of characterizing them with spectroscopy to distinguish among possible chiral imprinting mechanisms, with the goal of developing predictive models and guidelines to produce nanoparticles with customized chiral imprints and to produce novel charge and spin transport. Methods of theory, modeling, and simulation will be used to assist in structural design and interpretation of the experimental findings. · Task 2 will study directed charge transfer in chiral structures by examining how the charge transfer rate depends on the chirality of charge (and spin) localizing species. The studies underpinning this task build on our recent finding that nanoparticle-nanoparticle charge transfer depends on the nanoparticle chirality. We will pursue two complementary approaches to investigate these effects: photoinduced electron transfer in nanoparticle dyads measured with photophysical methods, and the measurement of energy transfer in chiral nanoparticle assemblies using similar methods. Methods of theory, modeling, and simulation will be used to design the experimental systems and to explain the measured transport rates. · Task 3 examines spin transfer in chiral structures that select the electron’s spin orientation. These investigations will build upon our recent findings on chiral perovskite materials and chiral metal-containing peptide crystals. The materials are multiferroic, displaying both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties, and offer new opportunities to control the spin properties of matter at the nanoscale. These studies will employ measurements of magneto-optical effects, X-ray diffraction, general tools of spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, transport, and magneto-resistance measurements. Methods of theory, modeling, and simulation will be used to interpret the experimental findings. The diverse skills of the collaborative team will enable them to build a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with the influence of the handedness of molecular and nanostructures on the flow of charge and spin across length and time scales. This understanding may have broad long-term applications in energy capture and conversion technologies, and in establishing new and novel classes of electronic structures and devices."
Functional analysis of genes encoding ubiquitin proteasome system components affecting complex traits influencing biomass resilience and productivity in poplar.,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023158,"Shabek, Nitzan","Nitzan.Shabek@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,davis","['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","A major challenge for plant biology is the development of more effective tools for determining gene function. In bioenergy poplar species, advanced tools are available for genome sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression studies, but the tools for assaying the function of gene protein products are less developed. The precise regulation of specific proteins’ levels represents a fundamental step of control for complex cellular processes such as gene expression, and whole plant phenotypes including growth, development, and stress responses. A primary mechanism for this regulation is through ubiquitin-mediated targeting of specific proteins for proteasomal degradation via E3 ubiquitin ligases enzymes. In this project, we will functionally characterize key components of ubiquitin-proteasome regulation of protein levels in poplar. Our data indicate that ubiquitin-mediated processes affect key aspects of wood formation in poplar, including the regulation of diameter of water conducting cells which impacts growth rates and resistance to drought. We will utilize proximity labeling strategy in poplar to determine gene function by identification of proteins interacting with a given gene product. Additional systems biology approaches will be employed to integrate gene expression, protein-protein interactome and phenotypic data.

Conformal REBCO Windings for High-Field Dipoles,Office of High Energy Physics,DE-SC0023028,"McIntyre, Peter",Peter.McIntyre@texasa&muniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","A new approach is being developed for a hybrid superconducting dipole capable of 18 T bore field, suitable for use in a future hadron collider. The development builds upon three innovations that have been introduced by ARL during the past year: ? A high-field insert utilizes a conformal-winding of a REBCO-tape cable in which all tapes are oriented closely parallel to the magnetic lines of force so that they can operate with maximum current; ? Current-sharing among the REBCO tapes of each, with low contact resistance, so that current is shared dynamically within each cable during ramping and also during quench. ? A block-coil configuration in which a Nb3Sn cable-in-conduit outsert is separately wound and heat-treated, then assembled onto the REBCO tape-cable insert, and preloaded in the flux return. Motivation: REBCO tape has remarkable properties for use in superconducting magnets. It can operate with useful current density up to liquid nitrogen temperature, and can produce very high magnetic field at temperatures of 20-40 K. The manufactured tape is ready to use as supplied, and does not require a final heat treatment after winding into a magnet winding – an important benefit compared to Nb3Sn and Bi-2212. But REBCO is extremely expensive, typically ~$60/m for a 6 mm wide tape capable of ~1500 A at 20 K. Also REBCO is a strongly anisotropic superconductor. The critical current I¶ when the field B is oriented parallel to the tape surface is ~4 times greater than the critical current I÷ when B is normal to the tape surface. If one could orient the tapes of a winding so that the tape faces were everywhere parallel to the field, excellent current performance could be realized. But in all dipole windings to date, B diverges in regions of the body winding and everywhere in the ends, so the winding current of a planar winding must be limited to ~I÷ and current density is limited to a quarter of its optimum. This challenge is common to all REBCO sub-windings utilizing twisted CORC, Roebel, and stacked-tape cable. Innovations; An insert winding is made using a tape-stack cable that is not twisted and not transposed – the orientation of each tape is sustained in a parallel orientation to its local magnetic field, and so operates with maximum superconducting current capacity. Current-sharing is obtained by preloading the tapes everywhere within each cable so that current can share among tapes as the dipole current is ramped, and during quench. Stress management is used to de-couple Lorentz stress within each sub-winding and between insert and outsert. 4-year program: Development will be undertaken as a collaboration with Accelerator Technology Corp. (which developed the Nb3Sn CIC technology and will provide use of a cryogen-free test cryostat) and Angelo State University. The program comprises four objectives: Year 1: experimentally validate the conformal winding in which a sub-scale racetrack winding is operated in a background field; Year 2: fabricate a Nb3Sn cable-in-conduit background field dipole and commission it for testing the REBCO insert; Year 3: fabricate a REBCO conformal insert winding and a Nb3Sn SuperCIC outsert winding; Year 4: perform experiments to study current-sharing dynamics in the conformal insert under conditions of ramping, steady-state operation, and quench."

Schurko, The Florida State University & National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Principal Investigator J. Autschbach, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Co-Investigator Objectives: The platinum group elements (PGEs), namely, ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), and platinum (Pt), are relatively scarce and costly, and there are serious problems associated with their use, such as limited PGE supply chains, recycling, and environmental impact. Despite these issues, PGE-containing materials play a special role in applications such as light generation, solar energy capture, energy materials, anti-cancer drugs, and catalysis, to name just a few; however, it is also crucial to identify abundant and cheap alternatives to replace PGEs in technologically relevant materials. In searching for other elements to use in place of PGEs, we must ask ourselves: “What makes PGEs special?” Notably, knowledge of the way PGEs bond with molecular units (known as ligands) to form a variety of useful complexes is of utmost importance for the rational design of new and advanced materials involving metals other than PGEs. The focus of this project is to understand the chemical bonding between the metal and its ligands in complexes involving PGEs, so that new complexes, featuring metals other than PGEs, but with similar modes of bonding and concomitant bulk properties, can be designed. This will be achieved with a combination of experimental measurements using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy and theoretical analysis using quantum chemical computations (QCCs). Methods: Measurement of SSNMR spectra of the PGEs can provide a wealth of information about molecular-level structure and bonding; however, the NMR-active isotopes of these elements are insensitive to the NMR experiment. As such, new experiments and protocols will be designed, and in combination with some of the highest magnetic field NMR spectrometers in the world (at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory), we will observe the NMR spectra of unreceptive isotopes such as 195Pt, 103Rh, 99Ru, and 105Pd, along with those from elements in the ligands (e.g., 1H, 13C, 14N, 15N, 19F, 31P, etc.). Three dimensional representations of NMR interactions, which are described as tensors, will be measured, including chemical shifts, electric field gradients, and electron-mediated nuclear spin-spin coupling. The computation of these interactions will link the experimentally observed NMR properties to the chemical bonding in complexes of PGEs, which are also determined by computations. NMR tensors are famously sensitive to chemical bonding in molecules generally, and in complexes of PGEs specifically. Computations of these interactions are likewise sensitive, namely to approximations, which are always necessary for molecules. The calculations will be designed to minimize the impact of these approximations, by making sure they accurately reproduce the measured NMR interactions. Potential Impact: The information on the nature of bonding between PGEs and a variety of different ligands that is afforded by SSNMR measurements of NMR interaction tensors and analysis of corresponding QCCs will reveal new pictures of bonding in PGEs, suggesting new routes toward systems involving non-PGE metals, and perhaps even the use of new ligands — this will greatly aid synthetic chemists and materials scientists in the rational design of new materials with desirable electronic, optic, thermal, and/or physical properties that do not require PGEs. Furthermore, the project will lead to new developments in the measurement of unreceptive NMR nuclei, for PGE isotopes specifically, but by extension also for isotopes from other parts of the periodic table. New approaches for the quantum-theoretical calculation of NMR interactions of solids containing PGEs will be developed. Once established, these new approaches will have broad applications beyond PGEs as well."

This work is crucial for the success of the experiment, and builds on a combination of PI Brown’s prior contributions to nEXO and his extensive experience with LXe detectors and calibrations. nEXO is a neutrinoless double beta (0?ßß) decay experiment at the forefront of its field. The experiment will reach a sensitivity to the 0?ßß decay half life beyond 1028 years, more than an order of magnitude beyond current half life limits, and in line with the global efforts for the next generation of 0?ßß decay experiments. One major aspect of the experimental design is the safe handling and processing of 5 tons of enriched Xe. A major component of this work will be the conceptual and preliminary development of major components of this plant, including modeling of the plant performance. Precision calibration of the detector’s light response is required, and dissolved radioactive sources have been identified as the most promising way to do this. Understanding the transport properties of dissolved sources in LXe is the key missing ingredient to developing a calibration scheme for nEXO. In order to realize a dissolved source calibration in nEXO, three questions must be investigated and answered: How is Rn and its progeny transported in LXe: this will be characterized by laboratory measurements to develop a predictive model. What is the impact of the Xe recirculation system on Rn transport: This will be investigated with Xe process simulations and coupled with the conceptual and preliminary designs of the nEXO xenon processing plant. How scalable is the model to a large-scale Xe system: this will be answered by operating and measuring a full-scale recirculation system to complement simulations. Measurements of transport properties will use 220Rn and 222Rn in a test stand at RPI to develop a data driven model that includes liquefaction of Rn doped Xe gas and surface plateout of Rn progeny. Process plant simulations will be conducted in the process engineering software, Aspen, to provide predictive scaling from the test stand to nEXO. The final deliverable of this work is a working model of Rn transport in a gaseous and liquid xenon system, including all critical Xe process components needed in nEXO. This will be used to generate calibration schemes for nEXO in order to design realistic light map calibration procedures for the experiment. This research is integrated with the critical path for nEXO on multiple fronts, as evident in the alignment with priorities outlined in the pre-CDR. Both the science of dissolved source dynamics and the project development of the calibration and Xe handling systems that are proposed here are key components to the success of nEXO, and are thus critical to making the next major step in the search for 0?ßß decay."

In chemistry, the ability to run large-scale predictive atomistic simulations can lead to real breakthroughs in photocatalysis and help solve such important problems as anthropogenic CO2 utilization. However, to take advantage of the existing and future hardware, the software stack needs to be developed. The team of two PIs from USC will be working on developing key software elements necessary to deploy state-of-the-art theoretical models on exascale. The proposed work includes developing electronic structure algorithms and software and employing them to study catalytic materials. The software will be massively parallelized and made ready for exascale architecture as well as for Cloud computing. Specifically, we propose to develop tools that will harness the computational power of the next-generation computer architectures and workflow automation methods to carry out high-throughput studies of photochemical and plasmonic pathways for CO2 reduction. We address the following key aspects: (i) Employ high-level ab initio methods capable of treating open-shell species and multiple electronic states, along with requisite properties enabled by state-of-the-art implementation exploiting cost-reduction techniques and parallelization. (ii) Harness full power of exascale computing to enable exploration of the nuclear degrees of freedom (dynamics, reaction pathways) and statistical sampling. (iii) Implement workflow automation routines, error-handling routines, and data-driven accelerators (such as database-accelerated dynamics and sampling) to enable high-throughput simulations and screening studies for these high-level methods. (iv) Apply these techniques to identify mechanisms of photoredox and plasmonic CO2 reduction and establish protocols for catalyst design and discovery based on high-throughput screening and reinforcement learning methods. Our team brings together complementary expertise of two PIs. Anna Krylov (USC) is an expert in many-body methods, including extension of these theories to model electronically metastable states. Krylov has developed an effective CC/EOM-CC suite of methods and open-source tensor library for many-body calculations (libtensor). Krylov will develop requisite infrastructure for deploying libtensor on exascale. Shaama Mallikarjun Sharada (USC) is pioneering mechanistic studies of organic photoredox routes for the little understood single-electron reduction of CO2. Sharada will integrate the methods developed by Krylov with workflow automation methods and apply them to drive catalyst design for photo-driven and plasmonic CO2 reduction. In addition, the team will develop general infrastructure for workflows, interoperability, and data-driven approaches (e.g., machine learning) such as tools for archiving the information from electronic structure calculations, on-the-fly generation of databases that can be used to accelerate potential energy calculations, and advanced checkpointing.

Kostadinova, Baylor University (Collaborating Institution Principal Investigator) This research addresses the large-scale stability of magnetically confined toroidal plasmas when subjected to small 3D intrinsic magnetic field-errors and applied 3D magnetic fields used to control the plasma performance. These 3D magnetic fields produce significant changes in the interaction of heat, particles and radiation from these plasmas with vacuum vessel material surfaces that needs to be predicted and controlled in burning fusion reactors. A major goal of the proposed work is developing control scenarios for naturally occurring transients due to edge instabilities (ELMs) that limit the performance and first wall lifetime of ITER, the proposed New Tokamak User Facility (NTUF), and other burning plasma devices. The research goals proposed address two of the four primary research objectives in FESAC 2014: 1) control of deleterious transient events, and 2) taming the plasma-material interface, as described in the DoE’s “Fusion Energy Sciences: A Ten-Year Perspective (2015– 2025)”. The project is divided into four research thrusts: 1) Develop realistic multi-mode modeling of externally applied fields and plasma response, 2) Understand the limitations of linear and nonlinear MHD models through validation of their predictions against available experimental data, 3) Understand the physics of magnetic island bifurcations and compare model predictions to available experimental measurements, and 4) Explore 3D fields for establishing innovative boundary radiative mantle scenarios for next-step, long-pulse burning plasmas. Thrust 1 will carry out resistive MHD simulations of the plasma response to 3D magnetic field perturbations. Thrust 1 will also employ Fractional Laplacian Spectral analytical code to model energy transport in stochastic magnetic fields. Results from this thrust will improve understanding of toroidal multi-mode effects in fusion devices, such as ITER. Thrust 2 will perform plasma response simulations with applied 3D perturbations using the nimrod resistive MHD code. Thrust 2 will compare nimrod predictions to experimental measurements on DIII-D and KSTAR. Thrust 2 will also develop synthetic diagnostics for validation studies. Thrust 3 will perform nimrod simulations of tokamak discharges to understand magnetic island bifurcations. Thrust 3 will determine the impact of island bifurcations on electron collisional transport. Thrust 4 will investigate novel approaches for creating cold, high density, stable radiating boundary and divertor plasma solutions needed to dissipate and control the energy and particle exhaust from burning plasmas, such as those planned for ITER. The proposed research will result in a substantial step toward establishing a robust operating scenario for controlling transients due to ELMs, which is fully compatible with radiative boundary plasmas. Demonstrating scenario such as this is urgently needed for achieving the ITER mission and for the development of fusion plasma physics adapted for the advanced reactor regimes required for generating net electrical power."
Search for Hidden Sector Neutrons at the High Flux Isotope Reactor,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0023149,"Kamyshkov, Yuri",Yuri.Kamyshkov@theuniversityoftennessee,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","The violation of Baryon Number, B, is an essential ingredient for the preferential creation of matter over antimatter needed to account for the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe; however, such a process has yet to be experimentally observed. Searches for neutron-antineutron oscillations, a |?B| = 2 and |?(B -L)| = 2 process, provide one of the most well-motivated avenues for discovering baryon number violating processes, and correspondingly require substantial investment and tremendous increase in available neutron flux. Another possibility that the neutron can transition into a sterile neutron state with |?B| = 1 has not been strongly constrained. If discovered, this process would be the first experimental evidence of violation of baryon number ?B = 1 that also could explain the persistent 4s disagreement between neutron lifetime beam-trap measurement techniques, and would offer a clue as to the particle nature of dark matter. Prior limits on neutron oscillations into sterile, “mirror” neutrons have been obtained exclusively from ultracold neutrons experiments, where some significant anomalous results have been reported consistent with the effect of neutrons oscillating into mirror neutrons. We propose to implement a novel approach using cold neutrons to search for two recently proposed mechanisms for neutron transitions into a hidden sector, by using the neutron regeneration method. In this approach, neutrons (n) transition into mirror neutrons (n'), which pass through a wall, then transition back into detectable neutrons (n), where the probability of transition is enhanced by manipulating the magnetic field environment. The experiments utilize the high-intensity neutron beam and the large area, low background neutron detector of the General Purpose – Small Angle Neutron Scattering instrument at the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Our approach was designed and checked for implementation in collaboration with the neutron instrument scientists at ORNL. First, we will perform a search for the transition of a neutron into a sterile neutron with non-degenerate masses, which was recently proposed as an explanation for the n-lifetime as measured by cold neutron beams being apparently too high. The proposed experiment will utilize an absorber installed in an already available superconducting magnet and will search for the sudden appearance of neutrons behind the absorber within large values of the magnetic field. Second, we will perform a low-sensitivity search for a new property of the neutron using a similar experimental setup. The Transition Magnetic Moment has been proposed to be induced by the transition between neutron and sterile neutron states, adding an additional loss mechanism for ultracold neutron lifetime measurements. This work will include developing simulations and feasibility measurements which can be used to design a high sensitivity apparatus. The beam time required for the experiments are modest and will be requested as part of ORNL’s General User program. These measurements will not only provide insight on the source of the discrepancy between neutron lifetime measurements and the composition of dark matter but will also convey an important experience in conducting searches for rare transitions of the neutron using cold beams. This experience will be critical to designing future stages of searches for neutron transitions at HFIR, leading to R&D opportunities that can pave a path to a high sensitivity search for neutron-antineutron oscillations at the European Spallation Source."

High peak power RF sources are the costliest component of accelerator systems and the requirement is for the cost to go down to $2/W average power (or $2/kW peak power for duty factor of 0.1%) Our approach involves producing high output power for the end system by performing end-to-end optimization of each sub-system. This involves combining a novel self-consistent global optimization algorithm with a choice of hardware components that are mass produced and work at low voltages. We took a multi-pronged approach to minimizing the cost of the individual sub-systems. In Phase I we have optimized the electrostatic focusing to get higher efficiencies. We started with Eizel lenses alternating with focusing cavities, but we realized that we can also use asymmetric lens to boost the energy of the bunched beam with improved beam confinement system efficiency. By combining magnetic focusing at the initial stages with electrostatic focusing and post acceleration, we expect to reach the targeted 1.1 MW power. We designed a flat cathode that reduces the cost of the electron gun by eliminating the curved shape that is expensive to produce. We have simulated the electron trajectories and their interaction with the first cavity to optimize the location and shape of this cavity and the gun parameters. The RF window design was adapted to accept an off-the-shelf mass-produced ceramic window for RF power output. Commercially available low-cost solid-state RF IC was selected for the low power input RF. An efficient and compact klystron body with optimized cavities was designed. An efficient beam dump with optimized shielding will further add to the efficiency in cost and form-factor. We have developed the necessary electrical and mechanical designing and manufacturing capabilities in-house. By designing the parts for manufacturing, we will reduce the cost and logistical challenges of external production. The design will include the split-cell cavity concept that we are currently using for manufacturing of our other RF components. This allows for significantly reduced parts count. Separately, we have developed a high-power modulator that enables not only the driving of the klystron gun but also provides the high voltage necessary for the focusing lenses. The design of this modulator is based on a well-known Marx-bank design but with the addition of pulse forming network on each stage of the bank to reduce the amount of storage capacitors and consequently reduce the system cost. This will be used to provide the electrostatic focusing and post acceleration. During Phase II of this project, we will build a prototype klystron. We will generate the mechanical design followed by machining, sourcing of off-the-shelf components, brazing and bonding of the parts. Finally, we will test the system with to provide at least 1.1 MW output power. By aggressively redesigning every aspect of the RF source with the goal of high performance and low cost, we will be able to meet the goals of this program."

Specifically, high-pressure and low temperature durable materials and nozzle designs that minimize ice-over, leaks and maintenance are needed. The goals for this program are to: develop materials suitable for hydrogen nozzles and produce prototype dispensing nozzles for field testing. The objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate innovative materials and methods to produce leak-free hydrogen dispensing nozzles. The approach involves the compounding and extrusion of new montmorillonite stranded and pelletized composites for 3-D printing of nozzle structures and modifying current nozzles with anti-icing nanocomposites. In Phase I and Phase II thus far, new montmorillonite intercalated composites were compouned with current low hydrogen permeable polymers and pelletized through an extruder for use in 3D printing techniques. Representative materials and coatings were subjected to conditions that mimic repeated filling of light duty vehicles at hydrogen stations. Hydrogen exposure was conducted at a national laboratory to evaluate the effects on ice adhesion, abrasion resistance, and mechanical ruggedness to achieve Technology Readiness Level 5. New commercial nozzles were modified with NanoSonic’s zero-freeze coating and tested in the field at a hydrogen station for a six month period with no reports of issues or failures. This test was conducted after a nozzle manufacturer noted immediate removal and zero freezing of the new nozzle from receptacles. Additional research is planned for the Phase IIA program to develop the entire nozzle and housing which will include integrated sensors through an advanced 3D printing approach. A plan to reach Technology Readiness Level 7 shall be continued through prototyping and field testing at hydrogen stations with our partners. Digital image correlation, X-ray analysis and pressurized leak testing shall be carried out at a national laboratory to achieve Technology Readiness Level 5. A down-selected set of polymers shall be produced via reactive extrusion for 3D nozzle prototyping. New composite nozzles and modified commercial nozzles shall be tested at hydrogen dispensing stations and per the current SAE J2600 specification. Lower cost and more reliable hydrogen dispensing nozzles shall significantly reduce unscheduled maintenance and reduce the overall capital costs associated with hydrogen fueling.

The key requirement for the realization of such groundbreaking technology is a clear understanding of how new phases of matter arise and evolve far from equilibrium in both time- and space domains. In order to gain such understanding, this program will use intense THz electric-field pulses generated by a femtosecond laser to directly modify the electronic structure and magnetic states at the atomically-abrupt interfaces between ultrathin oxide layers (calcium manganite and lanthanum nickelate). The objective is to disentangle, understand, and harness control over the intricate competing interactions responsible for tunable emergent magnetism at the layer interface. In order to effectively investigate such interfacial phenomena both statically and in the time domain, this program will marry the x-ray standing-wave method with the ultrafast polarization-dependent x-ray scattering and imaging techniques enabled by the most recent technological advances at the DOE's x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and synchrotron facilities. This will result in the development of a powerful new experimental platform that can be used to study electronic and magnetic systems driven out of equilibrium with time and depth resolution. The new depth-resolved ultrafast x-ray scattering techniques and instrumentation developed in the course of this program will be generalizable for immediate use at the DOE's synchrotron and XFEL facilities."

This approach allows for storing of solar energy in chemical bonds in a similar way as nature accomplishes through photosynthesis, where the energy of photons is used to drive the reduction of CO2 to a variety of high-energy products. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a promising class of materials in catalysis; however, their insulating nature has limited their application as electrocatalysts. Research in the Marinescu group has demonstrated the successful integration of metal dithiolene units into one- and two-dimensional frameworks by using dinucleating and trinucleating thiolate-based ligand scaffolds. The developed materials catalyze the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high activity. The objectives of this research are to understand the factors that govern the catalytic performance of these frameworks, by characterizing the primary and outer coordination sphere effects. These research studies focus on understanding the activity of these dithiolene-based MOFs, by probing the HER mechanism via a combination of kinetic isotope effect measurements and proton inventory studies to determine both the involvement of protons in the rate-determining step, and the mechanism of the proton transport through the framework. Additionally, these research studies also focus on the synthesis and electrochemical characterization of metal complexes and coordination polymers supported by phosphino-thiolate ligands. The thiolate group is expected to serve as a pendant proton relay and facilitate the transfer of protons, whereas the redox non-innocent phosphino-thiolate ligand is expected to facilitate the transfer of electrons. The use of strong donor ligands, such as phosphines, is expected to allow for an increased nucleophilicity of the metal center, and therefore facilitate the reduction of CO2. This research focuses on performing studies to identify reaction intermediates, which allows for a detailed understanding of the mechanism and competition between CO2 reduction and H2 evolution."

To make the parts nuclear quality, a real-time non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique is required to detect defects while they are being manufactured. The proposed NDE technique is a feasibility study of an optical sensor unit that is incorporated in a direct laser sintering machine to capture defects in real-time. The sensor data can be used to identify defects as they occur such that immediate corrective action can be taken. It also provides parameters that enable the prediction if the part is of nuclear quality. The proposed work is a multi-parameter sensing approach, incorporating multiple optical sensing, and imaging techniques. The apparatus will be incorporated in a 3D metal printing machine. The final outputs of the sensors will be combined to produce a defect map in real-time as the part is being printed. Defects such as voids improper melting, bulging of the metal, and out-of-spec prints will be revealed. During Phase II, a prototype unit was developed for detecting defects during 3D printing of metal parts. Samples with representative defects that occur during additive manufacturing of metal parts were tested. During Phase IIA an automated machine-agnostic prototype will be fabricated and tested that outputs part quality in real-time. Defect parameters will be extracted from the data and compared to actual defect values via a series of post-fabrication tests, and accurate prediction of defect parameters will be demonstrated. When this NDE technology is commercialized, the sensor unit will be incorporated in 3D printing machines without requiring design changes to the machine. The unit will detect printing defects in real-time. The sensor data will be utilized to pre-qualify parts for nuclear quality, and therefore minimize or eliminate the need for post fabrication testing. The economic benefits include reduction of cost of post-process testing, and significant reduction of loss of labor and material due to faulty parts. DOE and other branches of the government will benefit by streamlining the nuclear parts manufacturing. The reduced cost of manufacturing will help transition to modern nuclear energy, which will benefit the public by providing safe and cost-effective energy solution. Other applications include NDE for manufacturing parts for the aerospace industry."

Landes, Rice University (Principal Investigator) Stephan Link, Rice University (Co-Investigator) There are many potential applications of metal nanoparticles because they capture more light per volume than any other material due to the coherent excitation of their conduction band electrons, a phenomenon known as a localized surface plasmon. Understanding and controlling the fate of the absorbed energy in metal nanoparticles is therefore crucial for transforming such nanoparticles into functional materials and devices. The initially excited electrons can be extracted to perform novel chemical reactions with unique product selectivities, otherwise not possible in standard chemical catalysis. However, overall yields are typically low because of efficient relaxation within the metal leading to unwanted heating. To lift photoconversion yields, a transformative approach involving new composite materials and a deeper understanding of how to control the extraction of the energy absorbed by plasmonic nanoparticles is urgently needed. This project addresses this need by creating a new plasmonic-polymer composite material and characterizing how energy between its constituents is regulated to execute unique photo-electrochemical reactions. The objectives of this research are to 1) use electrochemical methods to fabricate active plasmonic core-polymer shell composites, 2) to monitor internal energy transfer between the core and shell, and 3) to exploit the catalytic properties of the polymer shell following energy transfer to carry out photo-electrochemical reactions with increased yields and selectivities. This research will yield molecular-scale insight into how to drive interfacial, electrochemical energy conversion and is therefore well aligned with the goals of the Condensed Phase and Interfacial Molecular Science program of the Department of Energy. In addition, sophisticated spectroscopy techniques will be developed and students and postdoctoral fellows will be trained on a wide range of physical materials characterization tools, preparing them to productively contribute to the Unites States workforce. This project is directly relevant to the interests of the Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, & Biosciences Division of the Department of Energy because it will span the following synergistic, fundamental research themes: Chemistry at Complex Interfaces, Charge Transport and Reactivity, and Reaction Pathways in Diverse Environments."

Additionally, inorganic N fertilizer is one of the most expensive and energy-intensive agricultural inputs in crop production, especially for sorghum. Improving sorghum's N use efficiency as an energy crop will enhance farmer profitability and alleviate the environmental impact. Extensive research has been conducted to reveal the N assimilation, transport, and reallocation processes to understand the biological basis of this essential macronutrient with the ultimate goal of enhancing N use efficiency. Studies in model plant species have identified specialized nitrate transporters, enabling the N mobilization processes to be well characterized. However, the N sensing, signaling, and downstream regulatory pathways remain largely unclear. Our team has generated resources and accumulated extensive experience in N-related research on sorghum. We have conducted the transcriptomic analysis using data collected from sorghum grown at five different N levels and four key developmental stages; edited a number of N-responsive genes through CRISPR-Cas9; collected manually measured and image-based digital traits from the Sorghum Association Panel under high and low N field conditions over multiple years and locations. In addition, we have developed several high-throughput phenotyping pipelines to extract N-related traits from the state-of-the-art LemnaTec Greenhouse and from UAV-based imagery data in the field. Furthermore, our group has developed statistical models and conducted empirical analyses to integrate the multi-Omics data to provide biological insights. In particular, population genetics and comparative genomics analyses suggested a cluster of genes may serve as a cellular N sensor to activate the Ca2+ dependent N signaling --- an essential step in the N pathway. In this DOE-supported project, we will partner with researchers from three institutions to form an interdisciplinary research team. By leveraging the existing strengths in gene-editing, phenotyping, genomics, and plant breeding, we expect to characterize the genes in hand and some of the newly edited N-responsive genes. Through population-wide transcriptomic analyses, we will also initiate the gene-editing process for the newly discovered N-responsive genes. At the conclusion of this project, we will deliver massive transcriptomic data for the edited lines as well as transcriptomic profiling of a natural sorghum population under high N and low N conditions planted in the greenhouse. We will analyze data through population genetic and comparative genomic approaches. Analyses from multiple approaches will facilitate the identification of candidate genes, and functional validation through genome editing will provide useful genes for improving N use efficiency in sorghum."

This diversity is most often a result of experimental innovation to achieve better electrocatalyst performance, but nonetheless makes it difficult to establish clear baselines for electrochemical performance and to understand the fundamental factors that govern changes in performance. Furthermore, theoretical understanding is impeded by 1) the lack of a universal framework that efficiently treats arbitrary electrolytes, solvents and applied potentials with sufficient detail and fidelity to realistically and accurately model electrochemical systems and 2) the deficiencies of density functional theory (DFT), the primary computational tool for reaction modeling, in describing charge transfer and reaction barriers. Accurate reaction barriers are crucial for connecting predictions to measured rates of chemical reactions; quantum chemical techniques that may be accurate enough are not yet practicable for heterogeneous and electrocatalyst systems involving solid-liquid interfaces. The proposed effort addresses both challenges above by developing accurate and efficient exascale-ready solvated beyond-DFT methods. The first ingredient in these methods are accurate atomic-scale electrolyte solvation models that capture the equilibrium effect of electrolyte in a single electronic structure calculation. The second ingredient is the incorporation of GW many-body perturbation theory and the random phase approximation (RPA) total energy, which are accurate methods beyond DFT, into solvated and grand-canonical techniques to make them practicable for electrochemistry including solvation and bias effects. Finally, in addition to optimizing these combined techniques for exascale computing, we will also make them more widely applicable using machine learning (ML) approaches trained to a beyond-DFT electrochemical database to make RPA-quality predictions at DFT cost. We will demonstrate these widely applicable techniques on the conversion of H2O, CO2, and N2 to hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and ammonia, respectively. Critically, we will bridge two open-source initiatives, JDFTx for solvated first-principles calculations and BerkeleyGW for beyond-DFT methods into an integrated computational framework for Beyond-DFT Electrochemistry with Accelerated and Solvated Techniques (BEAST), organized under three thrusts: Thrust 1 will develop the next generation of electrochemical solvation models with detailed double layer structure, automatically from ab initio data. Thrust 2 will facilitate beyond-DFT electrochemistry at exascale by combining grand-canonical electrochemical solvation and treatment of applied bias with the RPA method. Thrust 3 applies these techniques to several electrocatalytic systems, forming the BEAST-DB database for first-principles electrochemistry and will facilitate RPA-quality predictions at DFT cost by ‘delta learning’. Together, the BEAST team will deliver exascale-ready solvated beyond-DFT methods and ML acceleration using an electrochemical database to make truly ab initio electrochemistry accessible and ubiquitous."

Large owners and operators of photovoltaic and wind power plants are working to digitize performance and O&M data at their existing assets to improve their management of the facilities to increase performance, reduce O&M costs, and lower the overall life cycle cost of ownership. CSP power plants are behind the curve of other technologies on the digitization of plant information to aid in the plant asset management. This project directly addresses the objective of digitizing the O&M data of the solar field. The parabolic trough solar fields in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants cover large areas that can be hundreds or even thousands of acres in size. Solar fields often include thousands of individually tracking parabolic trough collectors that must be maintained. Each collector contains hundreds of components that need to be individually monitored, periodically inspected, and maintained. Currently there are no commercial products available for plants to use to monitor and track the status of their solar fields. Most plants must develop their own systems and typically use a mix of paper lists and spreadsheets to monitor the status of the collectors and the maintenance work conducted in their solar fields. Most CSP plants use computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) or enterprise asset management (EAM) software packages which are adequate to maintain their power plant equipment (turbines, pumps, compressors, etc). But these systems are not well adapted for use with solar fields with 10s or 100s of thousands of components which must be monitored over large areas. Solar Dynamics (SD) is developing custom database-driven software and aerial drone-based inspection capabilities for monitoring and tracking the status of parabolic trough collectors in solar fields. The system can be used to monitor the solar field during construction, through operation, and final decommissioning at the end of the plant’s life. Phase I of this effort focused on developing improved drone-based inspection techniques. SD developed techniques for assessment of receiver tube condition, mirror condition, and optical quality of collectors. Artificial intelligence (AI) was incorporated to extend the baseline aerial surveying technology to automate accurate technical assessment and rapid cataloging of problems without interrupting normal plant operations. Over the process of developing and demonstrating the drone data collection capabilities at modest sized plants (50 MW), massive amounts of data was collected, and it became clear that it was also necessary to develop innovative approaches for managing and viewing the data in useful ways. Such systems are needed such that plant engineers and management can query the data to analyze and identify systematic issues, enabling them to make educated and actionable management decisions. For this reason, in Phase II SD proposes to continue development of the drone-based inspections, but also to integrate the new FieldStatusTM program developed under a DOE Solar Energy Technology Office (SETO) SIPS project titled “OPTOM” (Optimization of Parabolic Trough Operations & Maintenance, DE-EE0006379) for viewing collector status and tracking issues. The SD team is well suited to execute this proposed work. SD personnel have led development, design, and operations of some of the largest CSP power plants in the world. In addition, SD has built and deployed a baseline aerial survey system that is the basis for further research and development under this SBIR project. The SD team has experience developing tools to support the O&M of CSP plants."

In order to minimize bowing and twisting defects in HAR features, precision control of the ion energy distribution function (IEDF) is required. Additionally, HAR etching requires longer processing time, and higher etch rates are needed to reduce overall cost, which requires higher power systems. Eagle Harbor Technologies (EHT), Inc. has previously developed a Rapid Capacitor Charger (RCC) that can rapidly charge the wafer and stray capacitance to high voltage in tens of nanoseconds and operate at 400 kHz. This system can produce sheath voltage waveforms that are flatter than those produced with standard sinusoidal radio-frequency generators, which can improve control over the IEDFs and allow for greater process control. Additionally, this system can operate at up to 20 kW continuously when water cooled, potentially allowing higher etch rates. EHT is conducting an experimental and computational program to improve the understanding of the interaction between bias waveforms and plasma properties to commercialize this power system technology. In the Phase I, EHT operated the RCC on a small test chamber with an inductively coupled plasma source. EHT constructed a retarding field analyzer (RFA) and the associated electronics. EHT measured the source parameters with a Langmuir probe and RFA. Initial investigations with the RFA were conducted with the RCC operating. In parallel, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) used a 1D particle-in- cell code to model the plasma with the applied bias voltage. EHT plans to modify the chamber to a capacitively coupled source, which is more relevant to the semiconductor tool industry and closer to the system that SNL is modeling. EHT will continue to develop the high-voltage RFA and investigate other energy analyzers. These analyzers will be used with even higher-voltage bias waveforms. SNL will continue to provide computational support to better understand the experimental results. The market for solid-state non-volatile memory storage is driving the demand NAND FLASH, which requires precision etching of HAR features with aspect ratios approaching 100:1. To overcome some of the challenges with manufacturing 2D NAND, the semiconductor processing industry is moving to 3D NAND. One of the major challenges with the production of HAR features for 3D NAND is controlling bowing and twisting of the holes. Improved control of the IEDF improve the quality of HAR features. Additionally, HAR etching requires longer processing time and higher etch rates are needed to reduce overall cost. EHT pulsed power systems have the potential to improve IEDF control while operating at the high power required to increase etching rates thereby reducing production time and lowering costs."

Recent work has shown that these containers are susceptible to stress corrosion cracking under conditions that will be present underground, where a combination of chloride-containing dusts and deliquesce leads to a concentrated aggressive aqueous environment. Under these conditions, the weldments of AISI 304/316 are vulnerable to stress corrosion cracking, a potentially catastrophic event. Better corrosion protection is required to ensure long-term safe storage of nuclear waste in dry storage casks. TDA Research will use a novel, highly effective coating system to protect the stainless-steel nuclear waste dry storage casks. This coating system has excellent barrier properties to prevent moisture and chloride attack and also contains active corrosion inhibitors. The active inhibitors are designed to stop stress corrosion cracking and pitting on AISI 304/316 steels and will ensure extended corrosion protection for the life of the dry storage casks. In the successful Phase II project, we demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in laboratory testing on AISI 304 stainless steel U-bends. The test pieces were sensitized to make them vulnerable to stress corrosion cracking and then coated with the protective system. The U-bend testing showed that we can prevent the stress corrosion cracking of the sensitized steel and extended to the time-to-failure over both bare stainless (as is used on the cask now) and over a control coating without TDA’s inhibitors. The coating had excellent adhesion and resistance to boric acid. In the Phase II project we will optimize the technology and validate it for the DSCC environmental conditions. We will maximize the corrosion efficacy of our active inhibitor package and incorporate them into an advanced coating formula in collaboration with a commercial coating manufacturer. The new corrosion inhibitor coating will be rigorously tested for corrosion resistance performance, heat and radiation resistance, chemical resistance, adhesion and durability. Finally, we will demonstrate application of our coating on a dry storage canister. This corrosion-inhibiting coating system is applicable for nuclear waste dry storage containers and can also be used for austenite stainless steels in chemical and power plants. Stress corrosion cracking can cause disastrous failure to occur unexpectedly, even with a minimal overall loss of material."

This program supports the science of the EIC with studies of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) using two approaches: via their Mellin moments, and via the so-called quasi-distributions. Specific quantities under investigation are form factors and generalized form factors for the unpolarized, helicity and transversity distribution functions.

Furthermore, we will use REUT technology to develop ultrasonic sensor to support instrument and control for nuclear applications. In Phase I, XII performed detail design studies using simulations and precision machining task and developed two REUT prototypes. The performance characteristic of the developed REUT matches the traditional off-the-shelf ultrasonic transducers. In phase II, XII will further extend the ongoing development of the REUT technology to meet application need of nuclear reactors and other nuclear applications. XII will further developed ultrasonic sensors using REUT technology to measure temperature, pressure, fluid level, etc. The primary consideration will be given to the making the ultrasonic sensors compact, having high sensitivity and long performance life. The developed REUT and REUT based ultrasonic sensors will be tested thoroughly in relevant environment, such as, conducting high temperature irradiation test at MITR to meeting TRL 7-8 specifications. Furthermore, XII will participate with subcontractors for licensing the REUT technology to be used in nuclear applications. XII has a clear transitioning plan for the radiation endurance ultrasonic transducer (REUT) technology. The outcomes of the ongoing REUT development are ultrasonic transducers and ultrasonic sensors, which will have a high tolerance and long life expectancy in high temperatures, and other harsh conditions including extreme radiation. The potential application of the REUT technology is in nuclear industry, such as, nuclear reactors (both domestic and military), nuclear waste management, nuclear war heard, handling radioactive materials used national security, medicine and research. The ongoing development of REUT will find application in non-nuclear field as well, such as, chemical processing, metal industry, refinery, oil & petroleum industry, charge particle accelerators etc. We anticipate the social and economic benefits of the proposed system are enormous."
Understanding Molecular Scale Chemical Transformations at Solid-Liquid Interfaces ¿ Computational Investigation of Interfacial Chemistry in Electrolytes and Charged Interfaces,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019483,"Pfaendtner, Jim",Jim.Pfaendtner@universityofwashington,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Understanding the molecular and nanoscale mechanisms of chemical reactions occurring at a gas/solid or liquid/solid interface is critically important to a huge range of processes of interest to the DOE. Compared with homogenous chemistry in a bulk condensed phase or gas phase, the modeling toolkit for predicting an interface-mediated reaction mechanism is far less developed, with many researchers falling back on individual reaction-by-reaction studies guided by chemical intuition. While very powerful, these methods are not equipped to handle the challenges of interfacial materials chemistry where intuition can break down, or the enumeration of individual reactions becomes too complex. Our goal is to move beyond traditional studies that rely on reaction-by-reaction identification and analysis. The work proceeds using model systems based on electrolyte decomposition in batteries and bio-inspired materials self-assembly over charged interfaces. We will relate the structure and dynamics of liquids at interfaces to their reaction mechanisms and kinetics. The dependence of both mechanism and kinetics on the properties of the interface will be determined. Following this, we will quantitatively link structure and dynamics of liquids to charge transfer processes at interfaces using a Marcus theory type expression. Finally, we seek to use an inverse-design approach to apply reinforcement learning methods to the design of new interfaces that can tune the reaction outcomes. This work provides a systematic framework for studying complex reaction networks in the condensed phase using sophisticated enhanced sampling simulations. The project will connect to at least three of the synergistic, fundamental research themes of the CSGB Division: Chemistry at Complex Interfaces, Reaction Pathways in Diverse Environments, and Charge Transport and Reactivity."

Two factors have enabled this success: the development of efficient computational methods and the steady growth of computing power. However, a broad class of molecules and materials that manifest strong electron correlation effects is still beyond the realm of classical simulations. The major bottleneck in applying classical methods to strongly correlated electrons is the exponential complexity of the physics of these systems. Quantum computers offer a solution to this problem by using a radically different approach to store and manipulate information that takes advantage of quantum mechanical principles. Recent years have seen a rapid development of quantum computing hardware and algorithms, including the first proof-of-principle demonstrations of quantum advantage (performing a task considerably faster than a classical computer). These developments have brought realistic expectations that quantum computers may outperform their classical counterparts within the next decade and ultimately deliver speedups with a transformative impact on quantum simulations. This research aims to create the next generation of quantum chemistry methods for strongly correlated molecules that will run on the first generation of quantum computers. This project will create new algorithms that make the best use of classical and quantum hardware and develop efficient implementations in open-source software. This research will also explore opportunities to demonstrate quantum advantage in chemistry and, in collaborations with industry partners, create standard benchmarks for testing new quantum hardware prototypes' accuracy and computing power. More broadly, this project paves the way to applications of quantum computers to study challenging strongly correlated systems critical to the mission of the DOE, such as transition metal catalysts, intermediates involved in combustion and photochemical processes, and novel materials that are beyond the realm of classical simulation."
Hydro-EKG: In-Stream Streaming-potential (SP) Electrical Monitoring of the Lifeblood of Watersheds during Disturbance,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023132,"Carroll, Kenneth","Kenneth.Carroll@theregentsofnewmexicostateuniversity(nmsu,lascruces)","['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Objective: This project aims to enhance and extend existing collaboration between a Minority Serving Institution (NMSU) and a DOE National Laboratory (ORNL), it is designed to support the environmental science investigations focused on biogeochemistry associated with hyporheic exchange, and it will develop a monitoring method for transient, hydrologic disturbance impacts on hyporheic exchange. The goal of the proposed work is to quantify transient variability of water sources and hyporheic zone fluxes between groundwater and surface water in East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC) in Oak Ridge, TN, which is an ORNL field study area with existing ancillary data collection instrumentation. We propose an environmental EKG method to monitor the “pulse” and health of streams and rivers with an emphasis on the dynamics surrounding hydrologic disturbances. The specific objectives include using geophysical and sensor techniques to indirectly and non-destructively characterize and monitor the exchange of the groundwater and surface water across the hyporheic zone. We propose to develop and test use of self- or streaming-potential (SP) as a noninvasive and repeatable geophysical sensor method for monitoring groundwater exchange with EFPC. We hypothesize that electrical geophysics using SP for transient monitoring in streams could act as an EKG for streams during hydrologic disturbances. Description: We will develop the SP geophysical method for monitoring groundwater exchange with EFPC as a function of time to characterize the seasonal and storm-event hydrologic disturbance that alter how water and solutes are released into EFPC during transient perturbations and variations in the hydrology. We will also examine storm events and seasonal perturbations or disturbances on the stream concentration-discharge (C-Q) hysteresis in combination with SP monitoring to evaluate impacts of potential transitions in gaining and losing stream conditions. We will compare C-Q and SP transient monitoring at two field sites to compare a more humid and perennial stream (i.e., EFPC in TN) to a semi-arid and intermittent/ephemeral stream (i.e., lower Rio Grande in NM). Impact: Prediction of biogeochemistry and ecosystem functions at watershed scales requires a detailed characterization of river corridor connectivity. However, current approaches to quantify hyporheic connectivity (and its biogeochemical potential) at this scale have not developed using noninvasive geophysical methods for transient monitoring of storm events and seasonal impacts on hyporheic exchange. Improvements in ecosystem functional representation through hydro-biogeochemical processes requires characterization of hyporheic exchange through hydraulic and climatic perturbations such as drought and storm-event flooding. Our study will provide the transient Hydro-EKG monitoring method for hydrologic disturbances and perturbations to be assessed with noninvasive sensor data collection to decrease effort, cost, and safety risks of manual in-stream measurements. We anticipate these methods will assist in identifying transient “hot moments” of enhancement in biogeochemical reactivity and cycling within hyporheic zones by monitoring the transient dynamics of surface water-groundwater exchange. Underrepresented or minority students will help conduct this research and will develop access and a collaboration network at ORNL and throughout the DOE complex."
Single-electron transistor microscopy of synthetic correlated quantum materials,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023109,"Feldman, Benjamin",Benjamin.Feldman@boardoftrusteesofthelelandstanfordjunioruniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","The main objective of this project is to integrate single-electron transistors (SETs) into nanoscale scanned probes to image emergent quantum phases in two-dimensional (2D) materials. One major research thrust will be to apply SET microscopy to measure electronic compressibility and visualize electronic states in novel moiré materials systems. Building on this effort, the PI will also develop a hybrid sensor in which adjacent SET and Hall probes enable dual magnetic and electronic sensing. Moiré superlattices form when two materials are stacked with a small interlayer twist, and have been shown to give rise to flat electronic bands in which Coulomb interactions play an outsize role. Past work has primarily focused on twisted graphene systems and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures that realize triangular moiré lattice geometries. This research will extend this work by fabricating and studying high-quality TMD homobilayers in new physical regimes. For example, Gamma-valley TMDs are anticipated to support a cascade of strongly correlated phases corresponding to honeycomb and kagome Hubbard model geometries. Further richness is added for other TMD materials by the expectation of topological Chern bands. The PI will use the SET to characterize the underlying single-particle band structure and investigate the formation of correlated and/or topological electronic states, quantifying any energy gaps. Both materials systems are eminently tunable, and the PI will map their phase diagrams as a function of twist angle, doping, and external field. Finally, the PI will extend this paradigm to investigate a newly available class of 2D materials: perovskites and their heterostructures, which can realize square lattice geometries. A second major goal is to develop a dual nanoscale sensor capable of correlating electric and magnetic signals using a single scanned probe. The approach will be to fabricate adjacent SET and Hall probes at the corner of a GaAs/AlGaAs wafer, and scan it above samples of interest. This will provide new insight into coupled electromagnetic effects in quantum materials. Potential targets for investigation with this tool include axion and Chern insulating phases in MnBi2Te4, and the coupled magnetic and electronic phase transitions between them, as well as multiferroic behavior in twisted TMD bilayers, where both ferroelectricity and magnetism are anticipated. Beyond these initial applications, such a combined probe promises new insight into a variety of other quantum materials systems."
3-PHOTON FLUORESCENCE DIAGNOSTIC FOR ABSOLUTE NEUTRAL HYDROGEN MEASUREMENTS IN A FUSION PLASMA,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023040,"Scime, Earl",Earl.Scime@westvirginiauniversityresearchcorporation,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Title: 3-PHOTON FLUORESCENCE DIAGNOSTIC FOR ABSOLUTE NEUTRAL HYDROGEN MEASUREMENTS IN A FUSION PLASMA Research Area: Discovery Plasma Science: Measurement Innovation Principal Investigator: Earl Scime, Oleg D. Jefimenko Professor of Physics Institution: West Virginia University Research Corporation 304-293-5125. escime@wvu.edu Funding Opportunity: DE-FOA-0002562 Over the last decade, our research team has performed absolutely calibrated neutral hydrogen density measurements in the edge of a spheromak; in a low-power, steady-state helicon plasma; and in a high-power fusion plasma materials testing facility (Proto-MPEX). The measurements were obtained through two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence (TALIF) at ultraviolet wavelengths (~ 205 nm) with a tunable wavelength, pulsed laser. To obtain an adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the 500 kWatts of instantaneous power of the laser was focused to a sub-mm spot, which compensated for the very small cross-sections of two-photon absorption processes. There are significant limitations to that “conventional” TALIF approach. First, TALIF at 205 nm is fundamentally limited in time resolution to the pulse repetition rate of the pumping laser, 10 - 20 Hz in most cases. Transient phenomena in the scrape off layer (SOL) and pedestal region in tokamaks evolve on much faster timescales and a radically different approach is required if neutral density measurements are to be acquired at cadences approaching 1000 Hz throughout a tokamak discharge. Second, the laser intensities needed to obtain useful SNR levels in a tokamak environment with copious spontaneous emission at the fluorescence wavelength necessitate focusing the laser at a single spot in the plasma. Since the pedestal profile directly impacts global confinement and fusion performance in tokamak devices, real-time measurements of the entire pedestal profile are needed for advanced tokamak control scenarios. Third, transport of 205 nm laser light is problematic. In our TALIF demonstration experiments on Proto-MPEX, we had to site our laser system nearly 20 m away from the Proto-MPEX vacuum chamber. Pulse energies of 5 mJ at the laser exit dropped to less than 1 mJ after passing through 20 m of air. One solution to all three of these challenges is to use a three-photon absorption fluorescence (3pLIF) scheme at 307.5 nm for neutral hydrogen fluorescence. Absorption of 307.5 nm light in air is more than an order of magnitude smaller than at 205 nm, short pulse lasers (100’s of fs pulse lengths) capable of generating 307.5 nm light routinely operate at 1000 Hz or faster, and if the laser power is large enough, an unfocused injection beam would enable multipoint measurements throughout the pedestal region in the edge of a tokamak. Here we propose to construct an absolutely calibrated 3pLIF diagnostic for neutral hydrogen density measurements and demonstrate it on a pulsed hydrogen discharge. Key features of the final system will include: operation at a repetition rate at 1000 Hz and instantaneous laser powers > 500 MWatts; measurement of the relative cross section between 3pLIF in deuterium and krypton using our existing absolutely TALIF system in combination with 3pLIF; spectrally resolved fluorescent emission induced by the 3pLIF laser pulses from which it is possible to determine the neutral deuterium temperature; and demonstration of absolutely calibrated 3pLIF measurements in a pulsed, deuterium-fueled helicon plasma. When completed, the diagnostic will be available for installation on existing magnetic fusion facilities."
"How Microbes and Minerals make Necromass that Persists
",Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022996,"DeAngelis, Kristen",Kristen.DeAngelis@universityofmassachusettsamherst,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Some soil carbon persists, sometimes for a long time, but we don’t know enough about this process to predict the long-term storage of carbon. New organic matter enters soil through plant detritus, and similar amounts enter soil through the continuous recycling of nutrients by microbial turnover, which generates microbial necromass. This microbial necromass represents a steady stream of new organic matter to soil, but new necromass is very sensitive to decomposition and loss as CO2. Surface attachment to minerals and other organic matter is the prevailing theory on the mechanism of soil C stabilization. But reactive surfaces and soil pores reduce bioavailability of nutrients that drive microbial turnover. How do microbes and minerals make necromass that persists? We take a trait-based approach to test our overarching hypothesis that necromass biomolecules are sensitive to decomposition depending on microbiome traits, nutrient bioavailability, and soil types. This project includes three laboratory experiments designed to test our hypothesis, all using four biomolecules as substrates that represent the majority of necromass composition and vary in nutrient (N, P) content: carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. By studying necromass biomolecules in combination with 13C and/or 18O labels, we can identify the distinct microbiomes active in transforming these four major classes of necromass. Our first objective is to define the microbial populations capable of degrading necromass macromolecules. We will selectively enrich soil microbiomes on carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids and proteins as sole C source. By reconstructing genomes from the enrichment cultures, we can identify the pathways used to degrade the macromolecules under oxic or fermentative conditions. Metaproteomics will describe how these pathways vary by substrate or energy source, and enzyme kinetics will help to model nutrient-specific pathways. Our second objective is to define the mineral and microbial traits that drive necromass decomposition. To do this, we will generate mature model soils that vary in pore size or clay activity, add macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids and proteins), then use 18O-H2O for stable isotope probing (SIP)-metaproteomics. This will define the pathways and populations active across soil and macromolecule types, as well as substrate-specific carbon use efficiency (CUE). Our third objective is to define the food webs and fate of necromass macromolecules over time. To do this, we will study natural soils from a temperate deciduous forest in New England, where long-term experimental warming has induced alternative nutrient availabilities compared to and their controls. We will trace 13C- labeled substrates through food webs and into soil compartments into stable, microbial, or mineral (CO2) fates. This work also includes a novel biochemical extraction, quantification, and identification of the extracellular enzymes involved in decomposition. Our final objective is to use statistical and mechanistic modeling to integrate microbiome dynamics in soil C dynamics. Statistical modeling using path analysis will define latent variables for yield (growth), resource acquisition (extracellular enzymes), and stress (biofilms, surface association), test the strength of these traits in driving necromass decomposition, and the extent to which they are linked to necromass persistence. Mechanistic modeling will incorporate proteomic and biogeochemical data into the Continuum Microbial Enzyme Decomposition (CoMEND) model, a CNP model derived from the MEND model that applies the principles of SOM decomposition to C, N, and P-associated substrates in a defined enzyme cascade to predict systems-level carbon cycling, e.g., the fate of organic C over time. Incorporating data from simple to complex soil microbiomes will help define how C, N and P availability contribute to the microbes and minerals that make necromass that persists. Key deliverables in our work include gene-centric and genome-centric analyses of soil populations involved in necromass biomolecule degradation; enzyme kinetics specific to soil carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid and protein degradation; a novel approach for quantifying and characterizing intracellular versus extracellular enzymes in soils using selective extractions coupled to soil metaproteomics; and trait-based predictive statistical and mechanistic models to define the microbial, metabolic, and mineral processes controlling necromass stabilization and long-term persistence."
Rheology-enhanced chemo-catalytic upcycling of polyolefins,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022294,"Scott, Susannah","Susannah.Scott@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,santabarbara","['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Polyolefins are common plastics made by linking thousands of olefin subunits together via strong carbon-carbon bonds. Physical and chemical properties of these very long “macromolecules”, such as their length, distribution, branch type and frequency, and extent of entanglement of the chains, have been designed and optimized over 70 years to create today’s high performance plastics. Their tailored mechanical properties allow their use in applications ranging from highly rigid containers to very flexible films. This project aims to integrate polymer processing with catalytic depolymerization to create higher value small molecules from these polyolefins. The specific aims of the project are (i) to control polymer conformations in the vicinity of catalyst particles using shear forces, and (ii) to design new catalyst architectures that enhance access of macromolecules to the catalytically active sites. The assembled team will synthesize model polymers that mimic the properties of commercial polyolefins, but with precisely attached tags labeling various structures (e.g., branch points, ends). These model polymer chains will report on changes in chain shape and dynamics at the molecular level via signals detected by neutron scattering and magnetic resonance techniques. The entry of the model chains into catalyst pores and their movement through the pores, driven by favorable interactions with the pore walls and offset by the penalty of chain stretching, will be monitored using dielectric spectroscopy. The project will achieve a fundamental understanding of these processes, enabling the design of catalyst pore architectures tailored to enhance their interactions with polymer chains, in the presence of flow fields that operate synergistically to promote depolymerization. This project will generate the insight necessary to design both catalysts and processes for efficient, controlled depolymerization of the zoo of different polyolefin structures, in order to recover valuable small hydrocarbon molecules. The approach will be demonstrated for linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) films, which are a significant contributor to the plastic waste problem and are largely incompatible with conventional recycling technologies."

In the face of escalating atmospheric CO2, multiple technologies are needed that are flexible and adaptable into existing and emerging carbon capture scenarios, including passive direct air capture (DAC). Advanced technologies currently include alkaline solid interfaces, metal-organic frameworks, and amine solutions, ionic liquids and polymers. All of these have drawbacks related to stability, recyclability, and limited environments in which they function. This project will elucidate and develop a new molecular approach to DAC that can be incorporated into any of the existing technologies. It has been discovered that DAC behavior of uranyl peroxide complexes transpires with very high yield capture (~three molecules CO2 per one molecule of uranium). Moreover, the CO2 capture is greatly accelerated by the presence of heavy alkali cations (K/Rb/Cs+), and the mechanism is not well-understood. Early d0 transition metal (TiIV, VV, NbV, TaV, MoVI, WVI) peroxide complexes, VV and MoVI in particular, also exhibit this potent DAC behavior, while the other listed metals exhibit either direct or indirect capture. The range or reactivity, and direct vs. indirect capture mechanisms provides opportunity to understand and learn to control the reaction. This collaborative project between Oregon State University (OSU) and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), seeks to 1) Understand the mechanism driving DAC of the above-listed metal-peroxide complexes; 2) Optimize their performance in alkali and alkaline earth matrices, amine solutions, and basic polymers; 3) Study regeneration of the DAC materials and conversion of the captured CO2. In addition to synthesis and characterization of materials at OSU, understanding the mechanisms of CO2 capture will be implemented by computational studies (ANL and OSU) and by surface spectroscopies at ANL (Sum Frequency Generation vibrational spectroscopy) and the Advanced Photon Source (APS, X-ray scattering/reflectivity). In particular, we seek to understand the role of the heavy alkali cations. More broadly, understanding the influence of the heavy alkali cations on reactivity, as well as the relationship between these phenomena observed in actinides and transition metals, will expand knowledge of the periodic table and the influence of seemingly non-reactive spectator ions (i.e. alkalis) on chemical processes."

Previous photocatalysts use oxides or nitrides. Despite decades of study, often with trial and erorr improvements to rates and selectivity, the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies remain much lower than the theoretical limit. This project will develop oxide coatings to protect semiconductors, such as silicon and gallium indium phosphide, to achieve efficient and durable photocatalysis. The surface of coated photocatalysts will be functionalized with nanoparticle or molecular co-catalysts. Understanding the coevolution locally at reductive and oxidative sites will advance the photocatalyst design beyond trial and error. Since the coating may develop pinhole defects over time, such understanding also helps mitigate photo-corrosion and improve durability. The objectives of this research include: (1) elucidating the roles of nanoparticle co-catalysts, molecular co-catalysts, and corrosion pinholes for charge separation; (2) characterizing the multi-scale coupled processes at the liquid interface; and (3) tuning the local energetics and kinetics by adjusting the co-catalyst local environment. The studies will take advantage of a recently developed kinetic model for photocatalysis by combining local measurements with numerical simulations to quantify important processes at the photocatalyst/liquid interface. Thus, photocatalysts with coating protection and corrosion mitigation can be designed to utilize the various co-catalysts for producing fuels or chemicals by harvesting solar energy."

Due to tremendous advances in RO membrane materials and module design in the past 20 years, the technology has reached a productivity plateau in which further development will have far more muted impact on system capital and operating costs. As a result, the focus is shifting to the feed water pretreatment subsystems. Micro- or ultrafiltration (MF/UF) of the feedwater thus far has been recognized as one of the most reliable and environmentally friendly pretreatment methods. Although polymeric membranes dominate this sector due to their low cost, reasonable productivity, standardized package design, and ease of replacement, like RO membranes, the technology has reached a productivity plateau after decades of development. Ceramic membranes offer a range of performance advantages over polymeric competitors that make them a superior materials choice for long term performance and mechanical stability. However, sticker shock, coupled with poor standardization in element design, remain the primary barriers to their penetration into the RO pretreatment market and the broader MF/UF water treatment market. Overcoming these problems remains a significant challenge. Still, in comparison to highly optimized polymeric membrane fabrication and operation, there are a number of areas uniquely available to ceramic membrane technology where advanced manufacturing can be introduced to dramatically reduce fabrication cost, improve productivity, and deliver a cost competitive product. If these goals can be achieved, ceramic membranes will stand alone as the next generation technology for RO pretreatment. In this SBIR program, the focus is to develop advanced manufacturing approaches in three specifically identified areas that reduce the cost of fabrication and increase operational performance and stability of ceramic membrane technology. The preliminary cost target is to reach parity with competing polymeric MF/UF membranes. However, the proposed approaches offer the potential to significantly drive the cost well below this level. Overall, in the Phase I program, we have demonstrated breakthroughs/first of its kind developments in an advanced ceramic membrane fabrication technology, an updated UF/MF industry standardized bundle configuration, and a superhydrophilic fouling resistant coating. Combined these new advances deliver dramatic savings in ceramic membrane cost, making them directly competitive with conventional state of the art polymeric membranes in RO pretreatment and a wide range of additional UF/MF membrane applications. In this proposed Phase II program, the primary focus will be to continue development of a low-cost ceramic membrane product that can compete directly with polymeric MF/UF membranes on an upfront cost basis in RO pretreatment and other water/wastewater applications. As in the Phase I program, the focus in the Phase II program will be on continued development in three critical areas, namely, (i) advanced manufacturing methods to directly reduce membrane fabrication cost, (ii) standardization of the membrane bundle for “drop-in” capability in industry standard Codeline vessels, and (iii) highly fouling resistant superhydrophilic membranes for increased membrane productivity. The focus will be on pilot and field test demonstration of these new membrane developments to validate mechanical and performance stability in actual water and wastewater treatment with our industrial participant. A range of significant existing market opportunities exist for a low-cost high productivity ceramic ultrafiltration membrane technology. Although the RO pretreatment market is substantial, ultrafiltration is much more broadly used in a wide range of non-desalination applications. Further, due to its durability, reliability, and productivity, a low-cost ceramic membrane technology would open doors to broader acceptance and penetration of MF/UF membranes into much more challenging applications in for instance aggressive wastewater, solvent, and oil recovery where no polymeric membranes are available."

We will achieve this goal through the convergence of well-established sensing techniques in the oil and gas industry with novel and disruptive techniques that are emerging from the field of quantum technologies. More specifically, we will use quantum states of light to enhance the sensitivity of fiber optic sensors beyond the classical limit. This approach will enable the detection of very small signals that are currently lost in the noise. We will use entangled states of light, known as twin beam, that exhibit squeezing to achieve the quantum-based enhancement. Furthermore, from a fundamental perspective, we will perform a theoretical study to identify optimal quantum states for the proposed application and test novel sensing modalities that can better take advantage of quantum resources.

This vast, mostly unexplored space at the intersection between molecular catalysts and heterogeneous materials presents unique opportunities for breakthroughs in photocatalyst durability and access to high-octane liquid fuels. The overarching five-year goals of CHASE, captured in three complementary thrusts, are to (1) understand the fundamental principles and design strategies that enable the integration of durable semiconductor light absorbers with molecular catalysts to drive liquid fuel production (Thrust A), (2) tailor the local environment around the catalyst on a molecular scale to direct reactivity along desired pathways (Thrust B), and (3) develop design principles that enable the cooperative integrated photosynthesis of liquid fuels through multi-catalyst cascades (Thrust C). Each thrust directly addresses all four DOE Priority Research Opportunities in Liquid Solar Fuels. To achieve the five-year goals, CHASE will employ comprehensive mechanistic studies to develop and evaluate technological advances that harness the individual strengths of molecules and materials to cooperatively overcome longstanding fundamental challenges and achieve sustained and selective light-driven transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrogen to liquid fuels and oxygen. This approach requires a diverse and deeply collaborative research Hub. CHASE will be led by a core team at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with partners at Yale University, Brookhaven National Laboratory, the University of Pennsylvania, North Carolina State University, and Emory University. A collaborative research model featuring a central core connected to cohesive teams at other East Coast sites leverages the advantages of local collaboration (longstanding collaboration and familiarity with available resources) with the advantages of inter-institution collaboration (maximal diversity of ideas and expertise and open access to specialized instrumentation and resources) to ensure that the CHASE Hub will be more than the sum of its parts.

The pursuit of these targets will require full utilization of the nationwide economic potential for distributed wind power; the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has cited this potential as 48 gigawatts by 2030 and 85 gigawatts by 2050. It is also estimated that, prior to capture, the capital cost associated with distributed wind turbine installations must be reduced 52% by 2030 and 71% by 2050. In the past, small wind turbines have struggled to reach cost- competitiveness in the greater renewable energy marketplace due to, in large part, high support structure costs and a highly variable installation process impacting both cost and quality. The technology proposed herein will provide immediate, industry-wide cost reductions that will accelerate the deployment of distributed wind and support the realization of these targets. The Small Business Innovation Research Phase I and Phase II efforts herein aim to validate and demonstrate a novel tilt-up tower and installation system – a system poised to deliver a 15%, approximately $1,078/kilowatt, reduction in the installed cost of distributed wind turbines rated 21-100 kilowatts. The industry-supported technology introduces standardization and efficiency to two of the largest cost drivers in distributed wind turbine projects: tower systems and balance of station (including foundations, transportation, and installation). The patented system leverages three innovations: a standardized pipe tower, a reusable tilt-up fixture, and a standardized prefabricated foundation (Figure 1). During Phase I, the company successfully established technical feasibility of each innovation and addressed the key technical challenges that have historically discouraged the development and subsequent commercialization of the industry-vetted approach. With technical feasibility established, the goal of Phase II is to fabricate and test a full-scale prototype and acquire the technical and commercial validation necessary for customer adoption. After Phase II, the company will be well-positioned to deploy the first of five Phase III customer demonstration projects for the tilt-up tower and installation technology. As an enabling mechanism, the tilt-up tower and installation system will thrust the distributed wind industry into a new era of cost-competitiveness and growth. The proliferation of distributed wind power will unlock gigawatts of untapped clean energy potential, accelerate the dominance of domestic manufacturing, and create tens of thousands of skilled job opportunities nationwide."

The carriers must be sufficiently long-lived to migrate to the semiconductor-electrocatalyst-electrolyte interface, where they are collected via energy storing redox reactions. Nanostructure can be engineered into photoelectrodes to trap light near the interface, thereby promoting absorption in regions of the semiconductor that improve the likelihood of collecting carriers versus losing them to recombination. Disordered assemblies of nanospheres can induce emergent &lsquo;slow&rsquo; modes that can localize light along tortuous &lsquo;paths&rsquo; through the long dimension of the electrode (multiple scattering) or in small volumes (Anderson localization). Defects in disordered materials can act as high-quality optical cavities or waveguides. This project seeks to develop the approach for improving the efficiency of PEC materials by controlling emergent photonic modes in disordered nanostructures. The specific aim is to advance the use of optical cavities at defects in disordered nanosphere materials as a new light-trapping nanostructure for photocatalytic (PC) or PEC energy conversion applications. This project outlines an integrated approach based on machine learning-driven light-absorption simulations, high-resolution materials characterization, and novel modes of materials synthesis to identify powerful strategies for utilizing disordered photonics in solar-to-fuels applications. The goals of the project include 1) simulating the optoelectronic properties of disordered photonic glasses based on the parameters defining the statistical structure (filling fraction of nanospheres, diameter of the cavity, and the local dielectric environment), 2) identifying synthetic methods for selectively functionalizing the defect cavities of electrodes, and 3) developing experimental methods to characterize the optical and photochemical/photoelectrochemical properties of the defect structures."

Toward this goal, we have identified water oxidation as a key problem that requires significant improvement. It is recognized that the detailed mechanisms by which water is oxidized on the surface of heterogeneous catalysts are poorly understood. The lack of such knowledge has been an important reason for the slow development of solar water splitting. We have proposed to address this challenge. During the previous funding period, we developed a new approach that holds promise for answering a few critical but actively debated questions concerning water oxidation. Our approach is based on a new catalyst that is derived from molecular precursors, whose active sites are well defined and characterized; our approach also involves a powerful infrared spectroscopic characterization tool for operando detection of reaction intermediates. Encouraging preliminary results have already been obtained. Building on these successes, here we aim to further advance the study on water oxidation through understanding structure-property relationships at the active center. Our central hypothesis is that the propensity for surface holes to accumulate on the catalyst’s active sites has a profound influence on the reaction mechanisms and/or energetics. This hypothesis is supported by recent studies focused on studying how the water oxidation mechanisms change as a function of surface hole density. The hypothesis is also supported by the results obtained in our own labs during the previous funding cycle. However, an understanding of the materials properties that favor or disfavor hole accumulation on active sites is missing to date. The knowledge gap is attributable to the difficulties in independently altering the chemical structure of the active sites and the electronic and chemical properties of the surface that likely control hole accumulation on active sites. By contrast, our catalyst system allows us to tune the propensity for holes to accumulate while maintaining the chemical structure of the active site. This unique system and our spectroscopic tools will allow us to systematically test our hypothesis. Specifically, we plan to monitor the reaction mechanism as a function of both hole density and propensity of hole accumulation at catalytic active centers. For the identification of possible changes of reaction mechanisms, we will study the kinetics of water oxidation as a function of hole density. To further prove changes of mechanisms, we will characterize the reaction intermediates using surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) in a time-resolved fashion. The IR-based intermediate detection will be corroborated with synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for more accurate peak assignments. For systematic variations of hole density and accumulation, we will build a study platform that features a photoelectrode for light-modulated reactions. Changing light intensities will lead to alterations of hole densities. The propensity of hole accumulation will be adjusted by varying the electronic properties of the catalyst support through strategies such as doping. The proposed work will establish rules for controlling the desired degree of hole accumulation on the active sites. This knowledge is essential for accessing efficient pathways for the water oxidation reaction while preventing parallel reactions that lead to catalyst deactivation, thereby making a critical contribution to enabling practical solar water splitting. The knowledge has been difficult to obtain previously because prior efforts have mostly relied on catalysts whose materials and active site structures are entangled; changing one would lead to inevitable changes of the other. Our catalyst design solves this critical challenge and presents an opportunity to systematically study these different factors independently. Equally important is the time-resolved spectro-electrochemical studies proposed here. They will provide the clearest picture of the water oxidation mechanisms to date. Combined with the structural clarity of the active center of the catalyst, we are poised to greatly advance the understanding of solar water oxidation."

Our recent studies of Chlamydomonas triose-phosphate and malate/oxaloacetate transporters (TPTs and OMTs, respectively) show that null mutants for some of them are unable to survive high light conditions that wild type cells thrive in, consistent with roles for these transporters in metabolite export from the chloroplast, redox balancing, and net photosynthetic performance. Our primary hypotheses are: i) oxaloacetate, malate, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), and glyceraldehyde phosphate (GAP) form the core of electron exchange between compartments of photosynthetic cells; ii) TPTs and OMTs are critical components of the machinery that exports these electron-carrying metabolites from Chlamydomonas chloroplasts; iii) distinct TPT/OMT isoforms are localized to the envelope membranes of chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes, facilitating the shuttling of electron-carrying metabolites among these organelles; iv) redox exchange by these metabolite shuttles is critical for Chlamydomonas stress tolerance and the integration of the cell’s metabolic networks in both the light and dark and; v) that the five Chlamydomonas malate dehydrogenase (MDH) isoforms have different redox-balancing functions that are reflected by their subcellular locations and their substrate specificities/preferences. The overarching goals of the project are to define the proteins involved in transport of electron-carrying metabolites from the chloroplast, determine how they partition the metabolites among various subcellular compartments, and learn how this circuitry limits potential damage to photosynthesis by excess excitation while satisfying the redox and energetic demands of the cell."

This work will test the hypothesis that interfacial properties and cation ordering in intergrown phases in CSMOs play a pivotal role in suppressing detrimental structural changes during electrochemical cycling. Hence, strategically designed intergrown phases can enhance the structural, electrochemical, and mechanical stability of mixed-phase CSMOs for sodium-ion batteries. To test this hypothesis, the objectives of this project are to (1) understand the nucleation and growth of intergrown phases within CSMOs through controls over composition, structure, and synthesis; (2) determine the structural, electrochemical, and mechanical stability of phase interfaces within the intergrowths; (3) identify the characteristics of the intergrown phases such as structure, composition, domain size, and microstrain and understand their effects on host rearrangement, defect evolution (e.g., cation ordering), charge transport and transfer; and (4) obtain a mechanistic understanding toward interfacial properties of intergrown phases in mixed-phase CSMOs across different length scales through a holistic experimental and theoretical approach. To achieve these objectives, the project will use an integrated and comprehensive experimental and theoretical approach. Experimental work includes the design and synthesis of new solid-state mixed-phase CSMOs, as well as advanced chemical, electrochemical, structural, and mechanical characterization of these materials. To guide the materials design and synthesis, data-driven computational frameworks informed by the experimental data will be applied to determine the thermodynamic driving force of the intergrowth process in CSMOs, elucidate the effective compositional handles for tuning CSMOs intergrowth, and reveal the mechanistic origin of the intergrowth process and enhanced electrochemical properties. This work will gain a fundamental understanding of the synergistic effects of intergrown phases on suppressing adverse structural changes in CSMOs, enabling the discovery of a new design rule that will advance the development of novel solid-state materials for energy storage. Despite the promise of mixed-phase CSMOs for improving electrochemical and structural properties, fundamental knowledge remains very limited, regarding the formation of the intergrown phases, intercalation kinetics, and interfacial and structural stability of this class of electrode materials. This research will fill the knowledge gap by systematically investigating why and how intergrown phases in CSMOs can be utilized to enhance solid-state material energy, power, and stability. The comprehensive and coordinated hypothesis-driven experimental and computational approach will enable materials to transform next-generation energy-relevant science and technologies, including unprecedented improvement in battery technology for electric grid applications.

Our central hypothesis is that a maladaptive loss in maximum quantum efficiency of CO2 assimilation in shaded sorghum canopies is caused by changes in gene expression mediated by certain transcription factors (TFs). We further hypothesize that these TFs can be identified using a synergistic systems biology approach that integrates transient TF-target gene validation, physiological measurements, and computation. To evaluate our hypothesis, we propose these research objectives: Objective 1. Develop a high-throughput pipeline to identify TF-target genes in sorghum leaves using a bacterial delivery system. Objective 2. Determine light-dependent differences in photosynthetic efficiency and gene expression throughout the sorghum canopy. Objective 3. Reveal TFs for improving photosynthetic performance in the crop canopy using gene regulatory network modeling and validation. Our objectives are well aligned with the United States Department of Energy Biological and Environmental Research (DOE-BER) program mission in that they address the challenge of associating genes with function in sorghum, a plant species of particular interest to the DOE as a potential bioenergy crop. The proposed project will utilize an innovative high-throughput approach to validate TF-target gene interactions in planta and determine how those interactions influence gene expression at different positions and light environments of the sorghum canopy. Tracking gene expression in response to light environment will allow us to determine which genes are differentially expressed and consequently implicated in the loss of photosynthetic efficiency observed in self-shaded sorghum. Gene expression will be integrated with our validated TF-target gene data through gene regulatory network modeling to reveal key TFs involved in photosynthesis regulation. These TFs will be the targets for future efforts to enhance overall plant yield and improve sorghum’s potential as a bioenergy crop. In addition to creating a new and innovative high-throughput platform for TF-gene target validation, the findings of this study will help steer efforts for photosynthesis engineering in sorghum by providing a map of the causal interactions that govern leaf physiology."

From this research, strategies for stabilizing tungsten through synergistic doping of interfaces will be realized and provide a framework for future alloy optimization enabling enhanced performance metrics, novel divertor designs, and opportunities to validate performance under relevant plasma facing material environments."
The physiological basis for a cross-scale understanding of hot spots and hot moments in carbon and water fluxes,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023025,"Kannenberg, Steven",Steven.Kannenberg@coloradostateuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Semi-arid ecosystems, like those in the American Southwest, exert a massive impact on the interannual variability of carbon and water cycling. Unfortunately, these carbon and water fluxes are notoriously difficult to predict due to their high spatial and temporal variability, which is poorly captured by the current generation of vegetation models. Indeed, this region is exemplified by the ‘hot spots and hot moments’ concept, which states that small areas in space (‘hot spots’) and transient moments in time (‘hot moments’) exert an outsized influence on biogeochemical cycling. However, the factors that regulate these pulses in biogeochemical activity are unknown, as is their variability across space and time. These uncertainties severely limit efforts to better represent hot spots and hot moments in models. Here, we seek to develop a generalized method for detecting and quantifying the importance of hot spots and hot moments from individual plant to regional scales. Underpinning this method is our recently developed statistical approach for identifying hot spots and hot moments. By applying this method to semi-continuous measurements of plant water status, a depth profile of soil water potential, and ecosystem fluxes via eddy covariance, we will track the fate of water through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and identify the mechanistic drivers of these transient pulses in biogeochemical activity. Then, we will expand this approach across a broad network of Ameriflux towers, and apply a machine learning approach that will allow us to upscale measurements of hot spots and hot moments across the American Southwest and quantify their impact on carbon and water cycles. These products will allow us to identify hot spots and hot moments across spatio-temporal scales and will serve as crucial data sources for validating a new generation of models that can better capture highly dynamic carbon and water fluxes. The proposed method will be easily transferable across biomes and will serve as a framework for future research on hot spots and hot moments across the plant ecophysiology, biometeorology, and vegetation modeling communities."

As these systems become more efficient, tailpipe emissions can retreat to the parts per million (ppm) level, which requires an equally precise NOx sensor to provide feedback for the active destruction system in the presence of the many components of post catalyzer exhaust gas. Equally important to maintaining the NOx destruction efficiency is the ability to provide diagnostic information on an ever-shorter timescale to tighten the engine control loop about its most efficient operating point. Finally, reliability, cost and manufacturability are crucial to helping these systems achieve widespread implementation and acceptance. New robust transducer structures that have high sensitivity, quick responses selective molecular determination and high concentration precision determination are needed to go along with cost effective manufacturability and robustness in the face of the extreme environmental conditions present in the exhaust of internal combustion engines. Over the course of Phase I program, Nanohmics has been developing a novel detection system that involves custom electroactive materials with electrolyte layers to significantly improve structural integrity and catalytic conversion efficiency at the tri-phase interface. The geometry provides a means for increased electroactive surface area and higher sensitivity when read-out in mixed potential mode. In this regard, the geometry provides a large increase in the catalytic exchange surface sites for electrical carriers during reactive coupling of the target species, namely NOx and NH3. The matrix of the electroactive material provides a means for gas target entrainment and diffusion which impacts the kinetics of the target species and ultimately presents as differences in the mixed potential measurement during real time read-out. In addition to the high sensitivity of the electroactive materials, co-processing with the oxide diffusion electrolyte materials leads to much stronger interfacial bonding that provides device longevity through prevention of material layer delamination over the lifetime of the vehicle. As a final measure, the team created structures for a read-out system that provides several enhancements compared to commercial amperometric devices or state-of-the art sensors. During the Phase I program, Nanohmics and team demonstrated the basic principles of the compact gas detection system and has been developing methods to integrate the novel materials with electrode readout arrays supported on electrolyte materials.

For the associated particle imaging technique to work, sufficiently fast and high spatial resolution alpha-particle imaging is required. Alpha particles are generated in the fusion reaction that creates the neutron as well. By tracking the location and timestamp of these alpha particle detection events, one has information on the initial direction and creation time of that neutron. While conventional in-vacuum scintillators and air-side position-sensitive light sensors are up to the task, getting the light through the vacuum window without loss of spatial resolution remains a key challenge. This vacuum barrier must withstand high temperature vacuum bake, be made of materials compatible with welding to the neutron generator target assembly and maintain vacuum integrity for a workable neutron generator. Using fiberoptic faceplates that present a zero optical thickness approach and maintain spatial resolution is a demonstrated approach, but the component yield has been small and there is insufficient commercial interest due to the size of the current market. Phase II development will demonstrate repeated feasibility for a 50mm success for the proposed application, Custom Fiber Optic plate (FOP) windows will be fabricated utilizing a fiber packing structure in a “half-hex” methodology and bonded to a mating alloy flange that will closely match the FOP’s coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Custom solid frit rings and upgraded facilities will establish Pilot production for 65mm FOP fritted to alloy flanges. Furthermore, this approach, along with developing a Hot Isostatic Pressing process to frit seal the matching CTE alloy flanges to a fiberoptic plate will help mitigate fracturing of frit seals in the final assembly. Stronger bonding from HIP fusing and closer matching CTE will allow the assembly to be welded into a stainless- steel housing and baked out at 350 C for an extended (>1 day) period without the loss of the vacuum. A successful effort to develop a hermetic glass-metal seal for a 50mm & 65mm diameter fiber-optic faceplates that can withstand the rigors of neutron generator fabrication helps to advance the associated particle imaging (API) D-T neutron generator state-of-the-art.

Difficulties in modeling methane emissions are driven, to a large degree, by the spatially heterogeneous nature of wetland ecosystems and by the high temporal and spatial variability of methane fluxes. This variability in fluxes is a result of the underlying heterogeneity of the wetlands, combined with the complex and interconnected belowground and aboveground processes of methane production, consumption, and transport. Eddy covariance (EC) and chamber flux measurements, and remote sensing of wetlands and atmospheric methane concentrations are routinely used to parameterize and improve land-surface models that predict methane fluxes. However, model optimizations are typically done against observations of the net site-level flux, or coarse atmospheric methane concentration and do not independently address within-wetland heterogeneity or the various processes that add up to the net flux. Therefore, even models that make accurate CH4 emission predictions may be right for the wrong reasons. The goal of this project is to improve simulation of methane emissions from coastal wetlands in the E3SM Land Model (ELM). We will improve ELM along three spatial and conceptual axes: (i) Patch resolution – expand the subgrid surface-tile approach, currently widely utilized in representation of upland vegetation, to represent ecohydrological patch types, such as open-water, mudflats, emergent/floating vegetation, swap forest, etc. (ii) Vertical resolution – provide vertically detailed observations of belowground dissolved methane concentration gradients and utilize ELMs patch-level vertical soil column to resolve methane production, oxidation, and transport at high vertical resolution. (iii) Process resolution– increasing the number, type, and accuracy of independent process representations that combine within the soil column and interact with plants to affect net CH4 emissions. To support these model developments, we propose to expand an already extensive dataset of observations in 4 coastal wetlands along salinity and tidal influence gradient. Observations include flux measurements at multiple scales: whole-site EC fluxes (in 3 sites, already reporting to AmeriFlux), chamber flux measurements at each ecohydrological patch type, bubble accumulations, and methane transport through plants. These measurements will allow us to directly test and parameterize the model at multiple scales, including specific processes resolved at the patch level, and go beyond the typical whole-site parameterization. Observations also include vertical profiles of methane, dissolved organic carbon, oxygen, and temperature in the soil of each patch type, using in-situ dialysis samplers (peepers). Soil cores for chemistry, metagenomic and metatranscriptomics, and methane, and carbon isotope analysis, will provide estimates of the presence and relative importance of the rates of particular microbial processes of production and consumption of methane. We will conduct sets of parameterization, validation, and sensitivity analyses simulations using the PEcAn workflow. After the optimization of the model at our demonstration site, we will use the framework of the Global Carbon Project methane reanalysis simulations to test the sensitivity of global methane emission forecasts to resolving sub-site ecohydrological patches. Our project will significantly improve ELM coastal-wetland methane simulation capabilities by implementing the sub-site ecohydrological patch-type approach, improving process representation, and careful testing and calibration against multi-scale observations. We will demonstrate the process-level multi-scale parameterization approach and provide direct observations to determine and directly constrain parameters within the multiple methane biogeochemical and plant processes represented in ELM. We will demonstrate the need for global within-wetland patch characterization and delineation, and patch-level flux and vertically detailed concentration observations."

That communication potentially occurs cell-to-cell with in a plant, and also embodies a type of cross-kingdom communication between plants and fungi. Like any form of communication, it is reliant on sending specific signals back and forth. Recent work shows that some of the signals preferentially loaded into plants and fungal extracellular vesicles are small ribonucleic acids (RNAs). This includes canonical microRNAs and a new class of &ldquo;tiny RNAs&rdquo;. Significant progress has been made in isolating extracellular vesicles from different organisms and examining their effect when applied to other organisms. However, very little is known about how plant and fungal extracellular vesicles are delivered and what is the final fate of both the extracellular vesicles and its cargo. The proposed research aims to answer some of the most challenging questions in the new field of plant extracellular vesicles by developing new Quantum Dot-enabled technologies for tracking extracellular vesicles carrying specific small RNA cargo. These new approaches will take advantage of the superior fluorescence characteristics of Quantum Dots, including their brightness, photostability, size-tunable emission, and their detectability by both magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy. Specific small RNA cargo in extracellular vesicles will be detected and tracked using Quantum Dot-based molecular beacons that can be easily multiplexed to detect different small RNA classes. For more quantitative small RNA detection, a sensor using Quantum Dots as a scaffold for fluorescent RNA aptamer sensors will be created. Quantum Dots conjugated to these small RNA sensors will be loaded into Extracellular vesicles by electroporation. Encapsulating Quantum Dots inside extracellular vesicles may bypass barriers including difficulties in getting Quantum Dots into living plant cells. Quantum Dot-labeled extracellular vesicles will be used to study the interactions between the important bioenergy crop plant, sorghum, and one of its pathogens. Extracellular vesicles from both will be isolated and their small RNA and protein cargo will be identified. This information will be used to design specific small RNA sensors, which will allow to answer several fundamental questions regarding plant and fungal extracellular vesicles, including how diverse extracellular vesicles are, how extracellular vesicles are taken up by recipient cells, and how do they move systemically within a plant. Answering these questions will enable new approaches to developing crop plant varieties, including sorghum, that are more resilient to disease, and other stresses."

This project addresses a well-known fusion safety hazard concerning aggressive high-temperature oxidation of tungsten plasma-facing materials (PFMs) in case of air-ingress accident scenarios, which could generate highly volatile radioactive oxide dust and lead to uncontrollable first-wall decomposition. Currently, there is not a complete understanding of the fundamental nanoscale processes of tungsten oxidation in either pristine or irradiated conditions. To fill these key gaps, this project leverages novel in-situ environmental microscopy methods combined with dedicated computer vision models to unveil the dynamic evolution of passivating tungsten oxide layers at the nanoscale and in real-time, including in the presence of radiation-induced defects. These in-situ insights will then be correlated with tungsten oxidation rate kinetics providing a coupled experimental and theoretical framework for predicting tungsten performance under off-normal conditions. This new mechanistic understanding will provide the knowledge basis for developing creative strategies to improve tungsten oxidation resistance, and will impact the designing criteria for next-generation tungsten-based PFMs that will have to balance between radiation tolerance and oxidation resistance, both of which are essential for the safe and reliable operation of fusion energy systems."

The unique chemical and structural turnabilities of DESs and NOHMs enable their rational design for the direct air capture of CO2 and energy-efficient solvent regeneration without thermal heating. Further, DESs and NOHMs are excellent candidates for encapsulation within polymeric thin films (e.g., core-shell), creating hybrid materials with multi-scale, large surface-area interfaces for CO2 transport and capture while maintaining the simultaneous benefits of liquid solvents and solid sorbents. However, the design rules for DESs and NOHMs are a knowledge gap that inhibits their broader adoption as DAC materials. The present research addresses this knowledge gap through synergistic experimental and computational approaches to understand the reaction mechanisms, thermodynamics, and the coupled kinetic and transport behaviors of DESs and NOHMs as they absorb CO2 for direct air capture (DAC), and regenerate CO2 upon electromagnetic irradiation. Through this work, the understanding of these fundamental underpinnings enables control and prediction of associated energetics ultimately leading to the rational design of new solvents, composite materials, and improved energy-efficiency in DAC technologies. Furthermore, determining the impact of the environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and oxygen on working CO2 capacity, reaction rates, and energetics allows for informed decisions about the cost and implementation of DAC with these new materials. To achieve the research aims, this research explores encapsulated and neat structured solvents, measures working CO2 capacities by absorption and regeneration by dielectric heating, employs advanced neutron and X-ray scattering techniques for structure determination, leverages 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques for transport studies, usees thermal analysis including differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry to evaluate stability, and applies a suite of computational methods, including density functional theory, molecular dynamics, multiscale sampling, and machine learning, to study mechanisms and molecular descriptors. These studies are directed to answer the following scientific questions: How does the solvent composition (number of functional groups, steric accessibility, and basicity) impact measurable macroscopic CO2 capacity and binding energy?; What are the molecular descriptors that govern CO2 binding energies and can they be used for predicting CO2 capacities in DESs and NOHMs?; How does the composition-dependent structural heterogeneity (domain sizes and extent of H-bonding) impact CO2 transport? How does the solid-liquid interface impact the orientation of functional groups in DESs and NOHMs and influence CO2 transport and solvent regeneration mechanisms? What are the individual effects of environmental factors and the interplay among these factors that define CO2 capacity, selective transport, and regeneration stability? Can CO2 bound to DESs and NOHMs be activated and released via electromagnetic-based regeneration? How do the power, temperature, and irradiation time impact CO2 release and desorption in capsules?"

These insights identified the need for new cost effective, conductivity-enhanced materials which will have a significant impact on the evolving national grid and electricity delivery system (EDS). Specifically, reducing transmission losses will be important for reducing costs to distributors and consumers. New materials will also play a significant role in the integration of renewable energy onto the grid. Recent events, such as the wildfires on the west coast of the United States, have also elucidated the need for increased component performance in extreme environments, where thermal stability, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance may play a role in the operation and safety of the conductors. Material improvements to the components used for electrical transmission have been identified as a viable approach to implement a breakthrough solution at the fundamental level. These improvements will enable the concurrent design and development of more efficient, safer transmission cables to help meet the needs of the DOE. This thrust of the CABLE initiative also focuses on manufacturing and scale-up of new technologies to ensure that new materials can be fabricated at the lab scale in a way that is predictive of large-scale production. During the Phase I program, QuesTek Innovations, a leader in the field of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and 2016 Tibbetts Award recipient, applied its ICME-based Materials by Design® methodologies and designed three aluminum alloy concepts to achieve higher performance and value effectiveness in overhead electrical transmission applications. These alloy concepts were designed to achieve high electrical conductivity, withstand higher temperatures, improve strength over baseline materials, utilize novel strengthening phases while simultaneously being cost conscious, and demonstrating processibility and achieving target microstructures. During the Phase I program, the QuesTek team identified target property windows in % IACS and hardness and achieved them through alloying and material processing. Aging studies at elevated temperatures demonstrated greater thermal stability than incumbent aluminum alloys used in cables. Processing methods were identified for further investigation which would be conducive to industrial scale-up. Under the proposed Phase II effort, QuesTek will finalize the alloy design of the new aluminum conductor, considering a balance between performance and cost. The alloy will then be scaled-up with respect to material production to address the CABLE initiative thrust to capture at-volume relevant properties in laboratory/pilot scale production environments. QuesTek will develop a dataset relevant to cable applications and compare the new material with incumbent alloys, and work with OEMs to manufacture and test a demonstration component."

However, to achieve higher power, the charge rate of a Li-ion battery must be increased, which is currently limited to avoid plating of lithium metal onto graphite for safety and cycle life concerns. By utilizing silicon dominant anodes, GDI is able to correct and mitigate safety and performance concerns for lithium plating at high rates, as there is reserve capacity for alloying any excess lithium atoms generated. Graphite is the main limiting factor when considering Li-ion charging speed, energy density, and safety. Lithium plating on graphite is the cause of many grids storage and EV fires. Understanding this, GDI is optimizing the Silicon anode interfacial stability to achieve high energy, fast charge Li-ion EV batteries at scale. In order to be cost-effective and efficient, our research efforts have xplored approaches to create silicon dominant Li-ion anodes through roll-to-roll plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) processes, the same type of processes utilized in solar technologies. Phase I research improved the interfacial stability of GDI’s silicon anode with electrolyte developments and molecular layer deposition (MLD) coatings on the anode surface. Initial testing was done in half cells to assess cycle life improvements and calendar life testing was done to specifically analyze interface stability. In half cells, when cycling at 2.2mAh/cm2, a greater than 400 cycle boost was seen in the best electrolyte relative to a standard DOE silicon electrolyte. The MLD coatings showed an improvement in formation efficiency, indicative of an improvement in interfacial stability, and also increased cycle life. Calendar testing was done based on NREL protocol, with a voltage hold and the current response was measured which correlates to anode SEI stability. Calendar testing revealed that GDI’s untreated silicon anode has excellent stability, bolstered by its inherent lower surface area. When compared to a commercial silicon-carbon composite, GDI’s silicon anode, with or without the MLD coatings, was advantaged in calendar life testing. In Phase II, GDI will focus on further improvements to the interfacial stability of the anode, with further MLD developments and electrolyte optimization. GDI would also investigate full cell architectures, as transition metal migration from the cathodes can yield undesirable anode impacts. This could be mitigated by surface engineering of the anode. The MLD treatment can be further optimized in 1) thickness, as only two thicknesses were explored during phase 1, and 2) via chemical composition, with potential for multi-layer approaches."

The global problem, and even crisis, associated with the increase of plastic waste in the environment calls for unique solutions to be applied on a large scale. The turn toward renewable biomass as a feedstock for polymer synthesis is a carbon neutral solution where the lifecycle of the feedstock renews on the order of months and years instead of millennia. However, along with the success of cellulosic ethanol and carbohydrate use from agricultural materials a clear absence is found for high value applications of the other 1/3 of biomass: lignin. Lignin, accounting for the highest abundance of natural aromatic units on earth, has put barriers between researchers and industry based on its difficult processing conditions, heterogeneous samples, and low reactivity. Yet, in the last decade an explosion of efforts has demonstrated impressive results in the chemical breakdown of lignin to usable starting material for polymer synthesis. The first goal of this project is to harness such methods to synthesize polymers that bring lignin closer to industrial relevance. The breakdown of lignin to usable phenolic compounds and lower molecular weight fragments enables the synthesis of high performing polymers. Using a non-toxic and biobased approach, this project will transform lignin into non-isocyanate polyurethanes, high performance epoxies, and thermally processable polyamides. These materials represent an enormous portion of the yearly polymer demand finding applications in almost every sector of society: automotive, building and construction, apparel, aerospace, packaging and more. However, the synthesis of sustainable polymers must also consider the end-of-life scenario. Lignin’s own concentration of C-O bonds is a starting point for chemical breakdown after synthesis, however, the functionalization scheme employed in this project extends lignin’s natural structure with additional labile ether and carbonyl groups enhancing it’s capacity for chemical recycling. In a further innovation, the use of recycled PET from one-time-use bottles will be incorporated in polymer structures utilizing established procedures for the chemical recycling of this high-volume commodity plastic. The design for recyclability of these non-isocyanate polyurethanes, epoxies and polyamides from lignin will be optimized and the second-generation materials will be tested for commensurate properties. The goal is to establish a synthetic pathway for processing lignin into high performing polymers capable of reversion to its monomeric units and re-synthesis. The overall objective of this project is the synthesis of biobased, non-toxic polymers that are recyclable by design."

The overall goal of the proposed research is to increase the availability of medical isotopes for fundamental research and clinical trials which requires transformative change from current production and purification methods. Resin-based chromatography is the current state of the art purification scheme and is known to suffer from diffusion limitations resulting in long-purification times and large column volumes to achieve sufficient product recovery. Current resins are prepared by physisorbing extractive ligands into a polyacrylic ester resin. Ligands can leach from these unstable resins overtime and contaminate the final product. Membrane chromatography is a promising alternative to resin-based chromatography because it is not diffusion limited and membranes are synthesized with covalently bound polymeric ligands. Practically, membranes are a chemically stable alternative to resins in which product recovery is not a function of flow rate. In this work, we propose the fundamental studies necessary to understand how to design membrane adsorber architecture and surface chemistry in order to (1) reduce radioisotope purification time from hours to seconds; (2) minimize elution volumes; and (3) provide a chemically pure product. Ultimately, the fundamental knowledge generated as a result of this proposal will lay the foundation for new radiochromatography processes that will increase the US supply of medical isotopes.

Despite the promise of sulfide-based Na+ superionic conductors for the development of solid-state Na batteries that featured by high safety and affordability, fundamental knowledge regarding how the dopant (cation/anion) leads to a stable crystal structure, and how the local disordered structure affect Na+ migration, as well as the structural and electrochemical stability at interfaces remain limited. This project aims to fill the knowledge gap through the combination of experimental synthesis/electrochemical tests and theoretical simulation, as well as the leverage of neutron technology and other advanced characterization tools. The objectives of this project are to (1) determine the structural stability and subtle features such as defects in synthesized new Na3-xAxSbS4-yXy (A=cation, X=anion) conductors. (2) understand Na-ion conductive behaviors and ion-conduction mechanism of new sulfide Na-ion conductors through a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical simulations. (3) investigate the structural, chemical and electrochemical stability at interfaces between new sulfide Na-ion conductors with electrodes (both anode and cathode) in solid-state Na batteries. To achieve these objectives, comprehensive experimental approaches and theoretical simulations will be employed in this project. Experimental work involves Raman, X-ray diffraction and Neutron diffraction for structure characterizations; Electrochemical impedance analysis and Neutron scattering for Na-ion diffusion; High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) for interface studies. The theoretical simulation methods include density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio molecule dynamics (AIMD) calculations on ionic conduction and structure/electrochemical stability at interfaces. Through the integration of experimental and computational work, the relationship between materials-structure-properties of new Na superionic conductors will be established. The obtained fundamental knowledge will allow to tailor chemistry in Na-ion conductors and guide future design and synthesis of new superionic conductors, promoting the development of next-generation solid-state energy storage technology.

Leach, Assistant Professor Department of Physics Colorado School of Mines Golden, CO, 80401 The search for sterile neutrinos is perhaps the brightest possibilities in our quest for understanding the microscopic nature of the observed dark matter (DM) in our Universe. Sterile neutrinos – unlike the active neutrinos in the Standard Model – do not interact with normal matter as they move through space, and are thus best observed using their mass signature. In this work, complete momentum reconstruction of electron-capture (EC) nuclear decay is employed to perform a search for sterile neutrinos in the keV mass range that is 10,000 times more sensitive than previous experiments. This is achieved using the EC decay of radioactive beryllium-7 atoms implanted into sensitive superconducting tunnel junctions (STJs) - an experiment nicknamed the BeEST (""beast"") for Beryllium Electron capture in STjs. A discovery signature in the BeEST experiment would be a small fraction of these decays where the daughter (lithium-7) atomic recoil peaks are shifted to lower energies from momentum conservation with these new, heavy sterile neutrinos. This approach is a uniquely powerful experimental method since it relies only on the well-motivated existence of this new type of neutrino, and not on how they might hypothetically interact with normal matter.

Toughening mechanisms in ceramic nanocomposites,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0018113,"Sheldon, Brian",Brian.Sheldon@brownuniversity,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Textbooks routinely tout the inherent advantages of ceramic materials for applications at high temperatures and in chemically aggressive surroundings. However, in practice the poor mechanical properties of ceramics (relative to metals) often prevent implementation in these types of harsh environments under mechanical loading. Thus, the research community has long focused on methods for improving these properties, particularly the fracture toughness. With this in mind the exceptional mechanical properties of some nanomaterials have led to efforts to produce new ceramic nanocomposite materials with substantially improved toughness. A number of these prior studies have now reported toughness improvements in carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced ceramics, and more recent studies have also shown evidence of even larger fracture toughness improvements in ceramic nanocomposites reinforced with graphene and reduced graphene oxide (r-GO). However, an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to increased toughness in these types of materials is lacking. In comparison with conventional ceramic composites, reducing the reinforcement dimensions by roughly two orders of magnitude leads to important new questions – in particular, the extent to which existing continuum mechanics laws are applicable. Because the scale over which fracture and decohesion occur are comparable to the reinforcement dimensions (e.g., nanotube diameter or number of graphene layers), phenomena at atomic or near-atomic length scales must now be carefully addressed. For example, in ceramic nanocomposites the idea of a distinct reinforcement-matrix interface must be reconsidered in light of the fact that the entire reinforcement is within a few atomic spacings of the matrix. Exploring the ways in which these inherently smaller size scales will impact toughening mechanisms is the central motivation of the work being pursued in this research program. Several different processing methods are being employed, to carefully control defects and other structural features. These well controlled materials are then being used to enable systematic investigations of toughening mechanisms that employ in situ mechanical testing capabilities that have been developed at both Brown and Rice Universities. This approach allows us to observe and monitor fracture mechanisms in ways that go well beyond prior studies. These experiments are also closely integrated with multiscale modeling efforts. Through this combination of careful processing, in situ mechanical testing, and detailed modeling, we expect to greatly expand the existing understanding of nanoscale toughening in ceramic nanocomposites."

Most of our understanding of solvent effects on the energetics and therefore kinetics is derived from homogeneous reactions, and a scientific understanding of the impact of solvent effects in heterogeneously-catalyzed reactions is not as well-developed. Liquid-phase isothermal titration calorimetry will probe the interaction of acid site titrants and alkanol substrates (for eventual catalytic dehydration) in solvents and solvent mixtures of different character to quantify the thermodynamic description of adsorption from the solvent phase. The influence of the nature of solvent interaction with the acid site and reactive intermediates will be rigorously quantified for the catalytic kinetics of alkanol dehydration. Three solvents – water, n-heptane and acetonitrile-water solutions – chosen based on their characteristic interactions with protons confined within a medium-pore zeolite (mordenite framework inverted, MFI) will be studied and their impact on the observed dehydration kinetics and reaction mechanism quantified through kinetic modeling. A more subtle influence of solvent on the thermodynamics of catalytic dehydration will be explored using a mixed solvent system, water-acetonitrile. Since solvent-proton interactions lead to the formation of a specific acid, tuning the mixed solvent composition may alter the nature and number of acid sites available for catalytic turnover. The impact of solvent identity and specific interactions with the acid and reactive intermediates will be quantified through measures of reaction order, activation energies and transition state activation parameters and derivation of appropriate reaction mechanisms that capture concentration and temperature-dependent behavior. Thermochemical Born-Haber cycles to rationalize the influence of solvent on apparent thermodynamics will be constructed utilizing additional information from gas-phase adsorption calorimetry, equilibrium adsorption isotherms and solution thermodynamics. Reaction rates quantified per available acid site and selectivity for alkanol (cyclohexanol, n-propanol and isopropanol) dehydration will be measured under conditions of variable intrapore solvent concentration and structure, from solvent-free (gas-phase) to the incipient intrapore condensation. Reaction rates will be rigorously defined utilizing non-ideal thermodynamic formalisms for each intrapore environment examined. Apparent differences in acid site availability based on the solvent type and structure included in zeolite pores will be probed by liquid-/gas- phase calorimetry and in-situ titration during catalytic turnover. The results from this proposal will impact our understanding of solvent effects in acid-catalyzed heterogeneous reactions. A quantitative approach based on isothermal titration calorimetry for assessing the impact of solvent identity on the energetics and availability of adsorption sites has been developed and applicable to related disciplines. The extent to which thermodynamically non-idealities influence the kinetics of elementary steps in a catalytic cycle will increase our understanding of how solvent impacts intrinsic kinetic barriers and how solvent selection influences catalytic activity and selectivity. The proposed condensed-phase chemistries to be studied are motivated by biomass valorization, but the proposed methods and reported results will be applicable to catalytic chemistries in non-aqueous condensed-phase systems, such as plastic upcycling and catalysis for fine and bulk chemical production."
Beyond Shear: Improving the Prediction of Plastic Deformation Activation in HCP Materials,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023110,"Bucsek, Ashley",Ashley.Bucsek@regentsoftheuniversityofmichigan,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","The goal of this research program is to improve the prediction of the onset of plastic deformation in hexagonal close-packed (hcp) materials by studying the sensitivities of slip and twin activation to the local three-dimensional (3D) stress state. The advancement of lightweight structural metals remains one of the greatest potential contributions of the materials community to a more energy-efficient future. Many lightweight structural metals with hcp structures require improvements to ductility and formability while maintaining strength. Tuning the critical activation energies associated with plastic deformation mechanisms (i.e., slip versus twinning) is a forward-looking methodology for making these improvements, but there is a fundamental gap in our ability to predict the activation of plastic deformation mechanisms in hcp materials. Slip and twinning activation is predicted using a critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) criterion that states that a specific deformation mode will initiate when its unique CRSS value is exceeded: This is known as Schmid’s law. Although Schmid’s law was originally derived for face-centered cubic (fcc) materials, today, Schmid’s law is applied for materials across all crystallographic structures. For hcp materials, reports showing a breakdown of Schmid’s law called non-Schmid behavior are prolific. In addition to microscale explanations for non-Schmid behavior (e.g., grain neighborhood effects), research has shown that the 3D anisotropic atomic configurations involved with slip in non-fcc materials can lead to sensitivities to the full 3D stress state (i.e., beyond the resolved shear stress). Because the atomic configuration between slip and twin nucleation are closely related, this implies that twinning will also be sensitive to the full 3D stress state in non-fcc materials. We hypothesize that accounting for these sensitivities can improve the prediction of slip and twinning in hcp materials and, as a result, improve the prediction of the onset of deformation in lightweight hcp metals. To test this hypothesis, we propose an integrated theoretical and experimental approach to understanding the energetics associated with plastic deformation activation that bridges eight orders of magnitude in length scale, connecting the atomic-scale origins of non-Schmid behavior to microscale crystal plasticity and macroscale yield phenomena. Slip/twin dislocation core structures will be determined with atomistic simulations and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and used to develop a modified Schmid law that includes sensitivities to the 3D stress state. This modified Schmid law will be calculated using a modified Peierls Nabarro formalism developed by Co-PI Sehitoglu that has been experimentally verified to produce realistic micro- and macroscale CRSS values and yield surfaces. The modified Schmid law will be informed and validated by microscale measurements of the local, intragranular 3D stress state and subsequent slip/twin modes in single and polycrystalline samples. These microscale measurements will be made using in-situ scanning far-field high-energy diffraction microscopy (sff-HEDM) experiments—a novel HEDM technique being developed at beamline 1-ID of the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) Advanced Photon Source (APS) by the PI in close collaboration with ANL-APS scientists. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach will bridge eight orders of magnitude in length scale and lead to the study—and disentangling—of atomic versus microscale contributions to non-Schmid behavior. The outcome includes a new framework for determining a material’s propensity to plastically deform at the microscale via its structure and energetics at the atomic scale, having far-reaching implications for predicting mechanical behavior and designing materials with targeted properties."
Shaping Symmetry and Molding Morphology of Triply-Periodic Assemblies via Molecular Design and Processing of Block Copolymers,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022067,"Thomas, Edwin",Edwin.Thomas@texasa&mengineeringexperimentstation,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Block copolymers (BCPs) are well known to self-assemble into a wide array of nanostructures, and in particular, at conditions intermediate to cylindrical and lamellar (stacked sheet) morphologies they form topologically complex, triply-periodic networks (TPNs). Periodic TPN assemblies are attractive nanostructures for many functional material applications that rely on their combination of symmetry and polycontinuous domain connectivity. Theoretical predictions to date almost exclusively point to a single class of equilibrium structures (i.e. cubic ‘double gyroid’ networks composed of trivalent nodal connections). Moreover, experimental realizations of BCP structures are prone to distortions that likely limit technological applications of TPN morphologies, from photonics, battery materials, and mechanical metamaterials. Predictive understanding is needed to engineer new TPN morphologies, from subdomain shapes to supra-domain symmetries and network topologies, in order to create high value functional materials through bottom-up processing of soft materials. The overarching objective of this project is to advance the principles that connect molecular designs of BCPs and the processing routes to successfully assemble TPNs of controllable symmetry, geometry and topology. Despite decades of study and powerful theoretical tools that rationalize and confirm broad equilibrium stability of double-gyroid in BCP melts, the ability to predictively direct synthesis of diblock or other macromolecular architectures to TPN structures beyond gyroids remains limited. The project addresses this challenge through a synergistic integration of theory of geometrically complex molecular assembly, state-of-the-art synthetic approaches to precisely defined architectures and innovative multiscale and quantitative 3D characterization methods of complex BCP domains. The research will test and advance two core hypotheses: The first proposes a new relationship between complex shapes of assembled domains and the arrangement of BCP chains in the structure. Testing and understanding the connection between complex domain shapes and underlying molecular arrangements will guide the design and synthesis of new molecular architectures that target novel TPN nanostructures. The second hypothesis addresses the complementary challenge of understanding how complex and inter-linked TPN phases grow and what are the key transformational pathways that determine their ultimate structure. Rather than chain-by-chain addition, we propose a new paradigm whereby TPN assemble by formation of multi-chain “mesoatomic” units, and in turn, these aggregate into ordered networks upon solvent evaporation."
Mechanisms of Deformation and Slip Transmission in Two Phase BCC/B2 Refractory High Entropy Alloys,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022043,"Ghazisaeidi, Maryam",Maryam.Ghazisaeidi@theohiostateuniversity,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Throughout human history, alloys have been closely tied to civilization. Even in the modern era, alloy design is still one of the most active areas of materials research to address the current and future needs of the modern global society. Particularly, alloys with enhanced performance at high temperatures are essential to fuel efficiency and emission requirements in transportation. We aim to understand the deformation mechanisms in a new class of two-phase multicomponent concentrated alloys (Al-Nb-Ta-Ti-Zr system), where disordered body-centered-cubic (bcc) and ordered B2-type phases coexist as either matrix or precipitates. We use first principles calculations, in combination with our newly developed method for phase prediction, to tune the composition until the two-phase target composition is identified. Next, using an integrated experimental/computational approach, we will characterize and fundamentally understand the nucleation and motion of dislocations and their transmission between the two phases. In addition, we seek to go beyond merely describing what the active deformation mechanisms are to predicting why they should be expected. We will achieve this by elucidating the role of the nature of atomic bonds and establishing a relationship between bonding nature and slip character. In the long term, this award enables a significant step towards developing an integrated computational/experimental framework, with predictive ability to discover new alloys with superior mechanical properties. The methodology, developed by this program can be applied to understanding fundamentals of deformation in a variety of multi-component systems such as “high-entropy” and superalloys."

There is also a need for increasing representation and inclusivity in the bioeconomy. This project demonstrates a unique approach to workforce development for rural and small businesses. The solution is a combination of a new tool and framework for workforce development and diversity & inclusion. The first component of the solution is a device that can deliver education and training programs to people with/without the Internet and with/without computers, anywhere, anytime. If the learners have a computer or mobile but no Internet, they can connect to this device wirelessly and start learning. If the learners do not have any computer or Internet, they can connect this device to a TV or other screens and start learning. The second component is the content, covering the foundational and practitioner-level skills. The content is portable across traditional Internet-based platforms and this new device used by people without the Internet and/or computers. In phase-I, research and development of prototypes and beta-testing were completed successfully, proving the technical feasibility and the commercialization potential. The Following eLearning programs were developed: (a) Introduction to Bioenergy and Bioeconomy, (b) Introduction to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, (c) What is Bioenergy (Spanish). In phase-II, a fully functional product will be developed, getting the solution ready for commercialization with enhanced features, security, reliability, broader environmental testing, and the maturity required for large-scale deployment. The primary goal of this solution is inclusive workforce development in the bioeconomy, making it more robust. However, it has a much broader commercial application: (1) Address the digital divide that exists across the country and the world, by making eLearning accessible and affordable to all.

These principles will guide the creation of microenvironment assemblies co-designed to harness diverse sunlight-driven phenomena, resulting in unprecedented catalytic selectivity, durability, and efficiency under a fluctuating solar resource, using dilute or impure feedstocks. LiSA will address this challenge by developing the new science of co-design of solar fuels systems as assemblies of catalytic microenvironments. Co-design of coupled microenvironments is a powerful approach to create systems for liquid solar fuels with controlled gradients in temperature and pH, as well as fluxes of protons, electrons, reactants, and intermediates, thereby setting up sequential catalytic steps and tailoring the chemical landscape for each step. Co-design is inherently adaptive and dynamic, continually incorporating advances and addressing challenges as they arise. The LiSA strategy is to achieve its goals by coupling multiple microenvironments, in integrated or cascaded format, to directly use sunlight to create liquid fuel products in a precisely tailored manner. These microenvironment assemblies include components such as photocatalysts, membranes and porous media for ion and molecular transport, media for proton and cation management, molecular and inorganic reaction centers, thermocatalytic reaction centers, and reactant or product separation media. They will be designed to co-optimize the highly selective generation of liquid solar fuels as products and the durability of the system. We expect that assemblies of chemical microenvironments for artificial photosynthesis will exhibit characteristics similar to natural photosynthetic systems, where different environments perform separate functions. To design systems, LiSA will develop a taxonomy of motifs for microenvironment assemblies and create designs using multiscale and multiphysics models that are validated in experimental testbeds. Catalytic microenvironments will be assembled from molecules and materials tailored for targeted functionality in capture, transport, and activity around the active site. LiSA researchers will explore novel light driven phenomena for achieving catalytic selectivity and will discover and characterize optical, electronic, and molecular processes involved in energy flow from excitation to the catalytic center. Researchers will develop and validate predictive models for component and interface durability, as well as the solar to fuel efficiency and selectivity under real-world conditions. LiSA will employ artificial intelligence/machine learning methods and principles, both in the co-design of systems and in the accelerated discovery of new component materials and descriptors of their durability. In situ and operando measurements will be used to directly probe coupled microenvironments during their operation, using ultrafast x-ray and optical spectroscopy as well as multidimensional optical imaging methods. Theoretical methods spanning from first-principles theory to molecular dynamics and multiphysics models will be used to understand and predict the energy landscape in microenvironments. LiSA will fundamentally transform the field of artificial photosynthesis, yielding: a new co-design of ‘assemblies-of-microenvironments’ paradigm for science advances in solar fuels; systems that create solar fuels from CO2 vapor and liquid streams; routes to solar-driven synthesis of multi-carbon products; new light-driven phenomena in complex chemical environments; and a new predictive science of materials durability and active repair.

Chemical and Optical Control of Spin Crossover: Ultrafast XUV Spectroscopy of Molecular Magnets in Native Solvation Environments,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020977,"Baker, Lawrence",Lawrence.Baker@theohiostateuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Chemical and Optical Control of Spin Crossover: Ultrafast XUV Spectroscopy of Molecular Magnets in Native Solvation Environments L. Robert Baker, The Ohio State University, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry (Principal Investigator) Many current and proposed applications in fields ranging from information processing to energy conversion to chemical sensing require the ability to observe and control ultrafast spin state switching. Consequently, establishing a thorough understanding of photo-induced spin dynamics in molecular model systems is critical to enable the design of new materials capable of reversible, bidirectional switching based on their underlying photophysics. There currently exists a materials gap between molecules containing single metal centers and extended solids compatible with device integration. To bridge this materials gap, we will study Co3Fe2 trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) complexes as molecularly well-defined model systems with local coordination and exchange coupling approaching that of actual solids. Direct observation of photo-induced spin crossover (SCO) in these pentametallic compounds will be enabled by element specific extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy with unprecedented attosecond time resolution. The spin state of Co3Fe2 and related TBP complexes is extremely sensitive to chemical interactions and are known to undergo reversible spin state switching as a function of gas pressure and/or solvation environment. Although it is well established that this compound exists in at least three distinct states as a function of chemical environment (i.e. gas pressure, solvent), the oxidation and spin states of the respective Co and Fe centers have never been directly measured as a function of chemical potential, and there have been no systematic studies of the chemical nature of the outer sphere interactions required to drive these transitions. The first specific aim of this proposal is to investigate the effect of chemical environment on the oxidation and spin states of Co3Fe2 TBP complexes. This will be accomplished using ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to measure the Fe and Co oxidation states in well-controlled gas environments. Results of these experiments will reveal the chemical nature of the interactions required to tune reversible spin state switching and will inform new theoretical models aimed at understanding how outer sphere chemical bonding mediates charge transfer induced spin transitions in this and related complexes. These experiments will also pave the way for time-resolved studies of optically-induced SCO transitions in Aims 2 and 3. The second specific aim of this proposal is to measure the photo-induced charge and spin dynamics in Co3Fe2 TBP complexes using ultrafast XUV spectroscopy at the Fe and Co M2,3-edges. These time-resolved measurements will provide direct observation of short-lived intermediates and reveal the fundamental kinetics underlying the charge transfer induced spin transitions in these systems. Performing these experiments in vacuum as well as carefully controlled gas pressures will show how chemical environment mediates photo-induced spin transitions in these model complexes. We will pursue sub-femtosecond time resolution required to probe coherent nuclear and electronic motion during intersystem crossing at previously unprecedented time scales. The third specific aim of this proposal is to extend ultrafast XUV measurements to fully solvated complexes in the liquid phase. To date XUV studies have been limited primarily to high vacuum conditions. In this project we will extend XUV measurements from vacuum environments, first to solid samples in well-controlled gas environments and then to fully solvated complexes in liquid solution. It has been shown that the excited state dynamics of SCO complexes depend strongly on solvent environment. These studies will provide a new approach capable of measuring element-specific spin dynamics in solvated systems with femtosecond to sub-femtosecond time resolution. This proposal will bridge photophysical measurements using ultrafast XUV spectroscopy with measurements of chemically-induced spin dynamics in order to provide a rigorous understanding of factors that govern ultrafast spin state switching in molecular model systems. Accordingly, this project will result both in new tools for observing ultrafast spin dynamics of molecules in native solvation environment as well as the fundamental understanding required to guide the design of new materials capable of reversible, bidirectional spin state switching under application-relevant conditions."

The gas-phase chemical kinetics of reactions relevant to their combustion will be investigated both experimentally and computationally. Phase 1 of the work will focus on the characterization of elementary processes by experimental and theoretical methods. Most experiments will be based on generation of reactive intermediates by ultraviolet laser photolysis of precursors combined with time-resolved electronic spectroscopy to monitor short-lived reactants in real time with microsecond resolution, at temperatures up to 1100 K. An alternative approach will be relative rate methods, where photoinitiated chemistry is monitored by infrared spectroscopy which allows detection of products as well as reactants, on a 100-1000 s time scale. The computational work will rely on density functional theory and coupled cluster methods to develop potential energy surfaces for chemical reactions, in order to deduce rate constants and product branching ratios. Transition state unimolecular rate theories, with allowance for anharmonic effects and multiple low-energy configurations, will be applied to derive kinetic information to help interpret experiments and to extrapolate to inaccessible conditions. In Phase 2 a jet-stirred reactor will be employed to monitor thermally-initiated chemistry at elevated temperatures on a ca. 1 second time scale, with infrared detection. The time profiles of reactants and products will reflect the impact of multiple reactions. An overall multireaction mechanism, incorporating the new results for elementary steps, will be developed in Phase 3 and validated by comparison with literature data and the new multireaction experiments. Likely outcomes are quantitative data for elementary reactions, improved understanding of the fundamental kinetics of species important in hydrocarbonammonia oxidation, and development of an overall chemical mechanism that will permit efficient design of new fuel and combustion engine systems, all with the ultimate goal of reducing harmful emissions and environmental impact."

Reed, US Geological Survey (Co-Investigator) Jennifer Pett-Ridge, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) Karis McFarlane, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) Xaiojuan Yang, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Senior Personnel) Hurricanes affect nearly every continent in the world and are among the most intense weather disturbances in forest ecosystems. In 2017, the coastal United States (US) and Puerto Rico were devastated by a series of major hurricanes that caused more than $200 billion in damages, which will have long-lasting implications for the economics and natural resources of US forests. At the same time, models project that temperatures in the tropics and subtropics will increase by 3-5 oC within the next 20 years. The combined effects of hurricane disturbance and warmer temperatures could fundamentally alter the trajectory and duration of forest recovery following disturbance, resulting in altered ecosystem states that are difficult to predict from historical data alone. Despite the immediate and significant effects of hurricanes on forest carbon and nutrients, as well as the potential to affect the long-term trajectory of forest recovery, hurricanes are not currently represented in Earth System Models, and no studies have captured the potential interactions of hurricanes within the context of a changing climate. To address this major knowledge gap, we will take advantage of a once-in-a-century opportunity to investigate the recovery of forest structure and function following a major hurricane disturbance under experimentally warmed conditions. We will leverage an already established field warming experiment in Puerto Rico (Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment [TRACE]), funded by the USDA Forest Service and the US Department of Energy, to capitalize on the experiment&rsquo;s wealth of pre-hurricane baseline data, including microclimate data before and during Hurricanes Irma and Maria, as well as multiple aspects of forest response following these major storms. TRACE is uniquely positioned as the first and only experiment in the world able to evaluate the combined effects of hurricane disturbance and increased temperature in a field setting. We will assess soil carbon, nutrients, and microbial processes along with plant physiology and chemistry in established warming plots impacted by hurricanes in order to address the following research questions: 1. Are there legacy effects of pre-hurricane experimental warming that persist after hurricane disturbance, or does the system &ldquo;re-set&rdquo; itself to new baseline conditions? 2. Will hurricane disturbance and increased temperature interact to generate soil and plant responses that fundamentally alter the trajectory of forest recovery? We will explore these issues both above- and belowground, drawing on a suite of research approaches. With this project, we would collect and synthesize some of the only data in existence that directly inform quantification, evaluation, and modeling of tropical forest responses to the interactive effects of disturbance and warming. Results would directly address DOE&rsquo;s mission to improve our understanding of globally important and environmentally sensitive processes in understudied ecosystems and to improve the quality of complex Earth and environmental model projections."

The DPCs are not designed for use in the final repository necessitating the costly ($20 billion) transfer of the spent fuel to repository canisters. As a more economical alternative, the U.S. Department of Energy is considering an option to fill the current DPCs with a material to limit the ingress of water, reduce the potential for criticality and make the canisters safe for direct placement in a final repository. The goal of the research proposed under this SBIR grant is to study geopolymer materials for their ability to limit water ingress and meet other repository requirements to enable direct placement of DPCs in a repository. The objective of this Phase 1 project is to research the effectiveness of four geopolymer materials as Dual Purpose Cask (DPC) filler material to enable DPCs to be directly deposited in a final repository, to avoid repackaging them into long-term storage canisters. The approach is to experimentally and analytically examine geopolymers to address repository requirements for criticality avoidance, chemical and thermal stability, homogeneity and consistency, rheological properties, material availability and cost, weight and radiation shielding, and operational considerations. Four different formulations of geopolymers will be fabricated at a bench-top level, experimentally tested and numerically analyzed for their suitability as Dual Purpose Cask fillers. Testing includes density, heat stability, leaching in water after 180 days, water absorption, volume of permeable voids, and hydraulic permeability. Numerical analyses will be performed to study their shielding properties and long-term degradation mechanisms due to radiation. The results will be assessed against criteria established by the U.S. Department of Energy for the direct placement of DPCs in a final repository which include criticality avoidance, chemical and thermal stability, homogeneity and consistency, rheological properties, material availability and cost, weight and radiation shielding, and operational considerations. Geopolymers that prove useful as filler material for dual purpose canisters to be placed in a final geological repository also are very attractive materials for radiation shielding applications. Geopolymer shielding material applications include shielding low-level waste facilities, spent fuel cask supplementary shielding, burial containers for low-level radioactive waste, supplementary shielding for a variety of operations at nuclear plants, and encapsulation for nuclear and radioactive materials at government nuclear sites. Improvements in shielding result in improved safety with lower radiation dose to workers and the public, and they reduce the cost of operations of nuclear facilities. Improved safety inspires more favorable public acceptance and confidence in nuclear energy, a clean and reliable energy source required to combat climate change."

The electronic and nuclear spin states of the defects can be isolated from the environmental decoherence mechanisms to realize highly-coherent quantum bits. A few quantum defects (e.g., the NV center in diamond) have shown promising optical and spin properties, and are finding applications in nanoscale quantum sensing and elementary quantum network. The limitations of the NV center has driven interest in investigating new defect and host material combinations. In particular, remote-entanglement generation and quantum networking applications require quantum repeater nodes combining coherent spin and optical transitions, strong light-matter coupling, operation at telecommunication wavelengths and high temperatures, and a mature material platform for scalable fabrication. The discovery of new quantum defects has proceeded so far by chance and on a case-by-case basis. We propose to change this paradigm and use high-throughput computing to accelerate the search for quantum defects, moving the field from serendipitous discovery to true design. By evaluating through ab initio computations important quantities (e.g., symmetry, formation energies, spin multiplicity, transition wavelengths, and electron-phonon coupling…) for a very large series of potential point defects and complexes in a host material, we will build a large defect database. We will analyze this database to select the most promising defects for quantum networking applications, and experimentally synthesize them for advanced characterization and theory benchmark. Our computational work will leverage and extend recent automation efforts in defect computations and most critically not rely on Density Functional Theory (DFT) alone. Using a tiered screening approach, we will use techniques from DFT to DFT+U+V and hybrid functionals using localized basis sets to perform a first screening of the defects. The more expensive hybrid functionals within plane-wave basis set will only be used for the most promising defects. This approach is critical to enable large, exhaustive screening while keeping a reasonable computational cost. As our defect database grows, we will use machine learning to uncover structure-property relationships and accelerate our screening process. While our project will establish a general framework for high-throughput search for quantum defects, we will focus on two materials platforms of great applied and fundamental interest: silicon and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as WS2. While most work on quantum defects has targeted wider band gap materials than silicon, recent results have shown that color centers in the infrared are present in silicon. Working with silicon would have tremendous advantages in terms of materials process and integration with current microelectronics. TMDCs on the other hand offer an emerging platform with unprecedented tunability and atomic level control. Following the leads from high-throughput screening, we will perform targeted synthesis of defects in silicon and TMDCs (mono- or bilayers) using ion implantation. Extensive characterization with Zeeman and Stark shift spectroscopy via cryogenic photolumiscence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) will elucidate the electronic structure. For selected systems, we will also use scanning tunneling microscopy to provide a direct atomistic comparison between theory and experiment. In addition to the opportunity of improved novel quantum defects in these two important platforms in the near term, the experimental work will provide very valuable feedback on the accuracy of our theoretical framework. During the experimental validation of interesting defect candidates, advanced levels of theory will be leveraged as well (e.g., using many-body perturbation theory and the GW-BSE framework) to compute and understand radiative but also non-radiative rates for inter-system crossing. Our work will offer a new approach to the search of new quantum defects beneficial for the materials systems considered here (silicon and TMDCs) and for the specific applications (quantum network nodes) but also for future new materials and other applications (e.g., sensing). It will move the quantum field away from serendipitous discovery and closer to true design setting the first stones of a quantum defect genome."

Addressing this challenge requires a multi-faceted approach that involves a vigorous move to renewable energy and negative emission technologies (NETs). Direct air capture (DAC) is arguably the most challenging NET. Conversion of CO2 into valuable chemical products could promote DAC deployment. However, a significant cost reduction is needed and could be realized by designing highly efficient, integrated CO2 capture and conversion processes that leverage the resources available at the existing infrastructure. This project aims to advance the fundamental understanding of a novel integrated DAC and CO2 conversion process that converts CO2 without using external H2. The work involves the design and development task-specific ionic liquids (ILs) for DAC and subsequently conversion of CO2 to chemicals (ethylene, CO, and polyketones) using ethane as input for a tandem catalytic processes. Advanced characterization and theoretical studies are employed to decipher the interactions between ILs and single-site catalysts with CO2 and to elucidate the CO2 capture and conversion mechanisms. Data science-driven predictive computation methods accelerate the design of new ILs and catalysts. The methodology has four critical components: 1) efficient CO2 capture, 2) H2-free CO2 conversion , 3) operando characterization, and 4) data science-driven predictive computation. Hence, this work will strengthen the foundation for technological advancement for the production of value-added materials, such as polyketones, from ambient CO2."

The company has developed high precision predictions of vehicle energy consumption and optimal charge management. The approach is to combine machine learning algorithms and predictive behavior modeling to process EV sensor telemetry, contextualized with maps, traffic and weather forecasts, and deliver high precision real-time predictions of journey charge consumption and charge depletion trajectory on the journey route while providing optimal charging recommendations based on driver preferences for journey time, time of arrival at destination, charging time and minimum battery charge during and end of trip. In Phase I, the company has developed and validated a learning-based cloud platform for EVs with observed energy savings of 15-20%. The platform consists of: proprietary vehicle performance models capturing the energy consumption and travel time on a per-vehicle, per-driver, per-road-segment basis; novel learning algorithms which estimate model parameters from contextual data; and model-based algorithms. The algorithms predict and optimize vehicle performance on road networks delivering high precision charge consumption prediction, optimization of charging stops, and route optimization. During our Phase I technical development and customer interactions we have identified two critical elements required by automakers (OEMs): (1) prediction accuracy: changes of time varying parameters such as weight, air drag and temperature gradients have a major effect on charge consumption, and (2) adoption: driver engagement cannot be taken for granted and the platform needs to deliver high precision prediction even when driver destination is unknown. In Phase II, we propose to build on the work of Phase I and develop models and learning algorithms to address both issues by improving prediction accuracy in parameter-varying scenarios and regardless of driver engagement by learning of destination. The company’s Contextual Intelligence platform will deliver numerous cloud services to EVs from high-precision charge consumption prediction, intelligent charge management, eco-routing, eco-cruise control among others. This would enable a more rapid adoption of EVs and improve their energy performance, resulting in dramatic reductions in fuel emissions and GHG through the replacement of gasoline vehicles."

The Rare Earth Element Extraction and Recycling (REEER) process employs green chemistry that will enable domestic, cost-effective rare earth recycling to significantly reduce strategic risks and price fluctuations associated with the import of these commodities. A stable, domestic supply of rare earth elements is available in the form of manufacturing wastes and recycled magnets to enable U.S. production of rare earth magnets, key components in electric vehicle motors and wind turbines. Rare Earth Element Extraction and Recycling utilizes a novel, recyclable, aqueous solution to recover a suite of rare earth elements including neodymium, a major component of high-strength permanent magnets. The target feed for the technology is magnet manufacturing waste or recycled magnet material that does not meet specifications for direct reuse due to oxidation or contamination. The product is a mixed rare-earth oxide which can be reduced to an alloy for magnet manufacturing or further processed for separation into individual elements. Results obtained during SBIR Phase I program demonstrated a 99% pure rare-earth oxide product with yields of 75% or higher in non-optimized experiments. Recycling the leach solution was demonstrated with no reduction in purity or yields. Overall, the project demonstrated a robust and reliable rare earth separation procedure on the lab-scale. Economic analysis shows favorable rates of return for a REEER plant over a wide range of feed and product prices. The REEER Phase I results identified key process parameters to be addressed during Phase II process refinement and optimization. The general Phase II approach includes system scale-up and optimization, verification of operations, and complete recycle of all components of the process. A commercial-grade mixed rare-earth oxide is the first planned product to be marketed using the proposed technology, which can be converted to an alloy by our commercial partner for magnet production. The Rare Earth Element Extraction and Recycling program will help to advance domestic rare earth manufacturing technologies, provide economic benefits via new business development, create new high- technology jobs, and boost U.S. security interests. The project provides a key piece of technology that can become part of a domestic critical materials supply chain and can therefore facilitate the integration of raw materials processing, refining, and product manufacturing. Securing a domestic supply of rare earth elements from manufacturing waste and recycled magnets of variable quality will substantially reduce strategic risks to the U.S. Government by reducing reliance on foreign providers and by helping to stabilize market price swings that can result from foreign supply interruptions."

Fast growing feedstock crops are required for a future bioeconomy where plant-based biofuels, chemicals and biomass for Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) will be utilized as part of a more sustainable, energy secure economy. Populus trees are ideally suited to this role, however they will be required to produce high yield on poor quality, marginal lands, that avoid conflicts with food and are likely to be subjected to increasing drought stress. Methods: We will harness the natural genetic variation found in wild trees adapted to different amounts of rainfall. Our main study population consists of 1,000 P. trichocarpa genotypes collected from a range of naturally droughted and wet environments, and that already has a number of unique genomic and genetic resources. Drought tolerance, here defined as &lsquo;the maintenance of plant biomass production in the face of moderate and persistent drought stress,&rsquo; is a highly complex trait. We will use high throughput phenotyping including UAV-mounted multi-spectral proximal analysis to unravel how drought tolerance varies across this wide population. Using the latest computational tools and the extensive sequence, re-sequence and RNASeq resources available, in addition to new resources to be developed, we will identify multiple genetic loci linked to traits and resolve them through hierarchical network analysis to the level of cis- and trans-acting eQTL. We will validate our findings on these regulator cis-acting eQTN candidates for drought tolerance in fast transient assays using protoplasts and in longer-term whole tree experiments including accurate deployment of CRISPR-Cas9 gene edits. The innovation in this project comes from the rapid deployment of these approaches that will also benefit from findings in a second Populus natural collection from a range of wet and droughted sites across Europe for which early leads on target loci are already available for validation. Objectives: (i). Deploy a large-scale experimental drought trial for up to 1000 unique genotypes of Populus, equipping the sites with controlled irrigation and drought treatments that are fully automated and monitored. (ii) Test the hypothesis that a suite of traits identified for drought tolerance in P. nigra can be measured in drought and control treatments in the wide germplasm collection of P. trichocarpa. (iii) Use established and novel GWAS model approaches to identify gene loci linked to drought tolerance traits of interest in P. trichocarpa. (iv) Undertake comparative analysis of GWAS results for drought tolerance traits in P. nigra and P. trichocarpa. (v) Use RNAseq in P. trichocarpa in droughted and control treatments to identify cis- and trans-regulated eQTN. (vi) Validate up to 50 cis-QTNs from network hubs using transient protoplast assays. (vii) Establish Agrobacterium-based gene editing protocols in Populus. (viii) Utilize early leads from previous research to investigate at least 6 candidate genes for drought tolerance in Populus. (ix) Validate up to 20 candidate genes for drought tolerance in P. trichocarpa refined from those tested in transient assays for cis-acting hub gene targets. Impacts and benefits: This research will deliver new Populus genotypes that are better suited and able to tolerate the droughted environments that are more likely in the future. They will be ready to test at multiple sites at project end. At the same time, the genomic and genetic resources already available in Populus will be integrated into high throughput drought phenotyping and a complete atlas of gene expression related to drought stress for this natural population."

A brute-force approach for the description of these catalysts is not feasible because it would require millions of ab initio calculations of structurally different active sites to estimate the effective rate constant. This research will address this problem by developing algorithms and software that combine smart sampling and machine learning to systematically and efficiently focus the computational effort on active sites with unusually low activation energies that, as a consequence, dominate the catalyst kinetics. These algorithms will develop training sets on-the-fly while also using them to guide the sampling. The ab initio calculations necessary for the training set will be performed efficiently in parallel on thousands of cores, which is in line with the Exascale Computing Initiative of the Computational Chemical Sciences program. These calculations will be complemented with classical and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to explore the effect of the solvent on the structure and energetics of the active site. The results of the MD simulations will permit the refinement of the prediction of the site activity by repeating the machine learning analysis including explicit solvation. The software will be tested on two important reactions of ethylene that are catalyzed by metal-doped amorphous silicates: epoxidation and polymerization. The mechanism of the first reaction is known, and it will be used as a reference, while the mechanism for the second reaction is only partially understood, and it will be used to test the predictive power of the methods."

Morrell-Falvey, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) James S. Goddard Jr., Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) To improve plant traits for feed, fiber, and energy applications, it is critical to understand the short and long-range signaling mechanisms plants use to control growth, biomass composition, senescence and responses to environmental stresses. It is known that many small molecules (ligands) have profound effects on plants, through mechanisms that remain largely obscure. Key gaps in knowledge include: an understanding of the mechanisms that govern the movement and fate of ligands; an integrated map of which short- and long-range signaling events are directly due to ligand perception by specific receptors and which are due to induced second messengers; and the effects of plant stressors on the long distance trafficking of signaling ligands. Progress in filling these knowledge gaps has been severely hindered by technical gaps in methods suitable for studying the relevant signaling mechanisms in vivo. This project will develop new technologies for the introduction and observation of signaling probes in live plants. Our approach will provide two key advances, the abilities (1) to deliver labeled non-membrane permeant probes, such as proteins, signaling reporters, and DNA, to plant tissue with single-cell precision and (2) to perform repeated imaging (e.g. fluorescence) of broad tissue areas within intact living plants, including leaves. To realize the first advance (better probe delivery), arrays of carbon nanofiber spikes that transiently permeablize plant cells without causing substantial injury will be employed. To realize the second advance (repeated imaging), a novel imaging system will be developed that employs benign fiducial markers on plant surfaces for anatomical reference and robotically controlled fiber optic microscopes with CCD cameras to provide images of plant tissues and cells in situ. This imaging system will enable subcellular imaging. This system will provide reliable, non-invasive repeat imaging on intact plants and will be set up to image multiple plants in series with the goal of making the imaging automated. These technical capabilities will be developed in the context of an important, but poorly understood, plant signaling system that controls biomass, cell growth, tissue longevity (senescence), and stress tolerance. This system consists of a secreted ligand called phytosulfokine (PSK), which is a 5 amino acid sulfated peptide, and its cell surface receptors (PSKRs). PSK signaling has both autonomous and non-autonomous effects. With the aid of the newly developed techniques, it will be possible to discern the trafficking patterns and abundance of the PSK ligand in the presence and absence of its receptors and abiotic stressors that affect growth and biomass. A key goal will be to measure the spatial and temporal signaling events at different scales (within treated cells and distal cells and tissues). The ability to track signaling molecules in vivowill provide an unprecedented capability to explore the fundamental processes underlying plant growth and physiology, which in turn will accelerate the development of improved plant varieties in support of DOE missions. The plant systems to be analyzed include Arabidopsis and Populus. The former system will permit important benchmarks to be rapidly achieved, whereas the latter system, an important bioenergy crop, will show the potential of the imaging platform and probe delivery system to accelerate research findings."

These devices, which facilitate processes ranging from energy conversion to environmental cleanup, are powered by electrocatalysts composed of precious metals and oxides. Recently, computational studies have become indispensable tools in developing fundamental understanding of how electrocatalysts operate and, in some cases, enhancing their performance. In spite of these exciting successes, however, there remain numerous types of electrocatalytic systems that cannot easily be studied with existing computational methods. In particular, it has been difficult to simulate electrocatalysts that contain large molecules that react, and produce energy, through complicated, multistep chemical reaction networks at the interface between solid electrocatalyst surfaces and surrounding liquid electrolytes. In this work, the challenges described above will be addressed through the development of simulation strategies that explicitly describe the interplay between complex electrocatalytic molecules, the structure of the catalyst surfaces, and the water-based electrolytes contained in most electrocatalytic devices. We will combine these tools in the study of electrooxidation of ethanol and related molecules, which have the potential to produce electricity from renewable fuels. The outcome of the research will be a comprehensive description of oxygenate electrocatalysis, design principles to seek improved catalysts for these reactions, and methodological approaches that can efficiently describe similar sources of complexity in more general electrocatalytic processes."

These microwave imaging diagnostic instruments, developed by UC Davis and PPPL, have made important contributions to fusion science during the current Diagnostics Development grant and have been adopted at preeminent tokamak facilities worldwide including DIII-D, EAST, AUG, HL-2A, KSTAR, and J-TEXT. During the current grant period, the team has developed a millimeter wave “System-on-Chip” approach where integrated circuit technology is employed to fabricate complete receivers and transmitter on a chip of only a millimeter or so on a side which are inserted into horn-waveguide modules. A test ECEI system employing the SOC technology was installed on the DIII-D tokamak and demonstrated significant improvements, including signal-to-noise ratio increase and outstanding shielding and radiation resistance ability as required in burning plasma operation and physics studies. Visualization diagnostics provides high spatial/temporal images with the resultant massive data sets. A customized data analysis module has been developed for electron temperature fluctuation images, spectra, dispersion, and correlation. The ECEI module has been released on the OMFIT platform for the UC Davis team, together with the DIII-D team and collaborators. In addition, the interpretation of diagnostic data no longer applies to simple approximations in burning plasma caused by a variety of complex effects such as relativistic effects, beam refraction, finite plasma interaction volume, and optical thickness. The UC Davis and PPPL teams have developed synthetic diagnostics (ECEI/MIR) to interpret experimental data and validate theory. Synthetic diagnostics are able to predict measurement limitations and improve the hardware initial setup. In the proposed program, we will pursue three major transformative technological advancements for fusion plasma diagnostics: custom mm-wave integrated circuits (ICs), wideband gap materials for millimeter wave electronics operation in harsh burning plasma environments, and synthetic diagnostic modeling (SDM)/AI. These technologies will redefine the state-of-the-art for microwave fusion plasma imaging, ultimately enabling compact and low-noise transceiver systems with real-time, fast tracking ability to address critical fusion plasma physics issues, including ELM suppression and disruptions avoidance in the ITER baseline scenario, naturally ELM-free states such as QH-mode, and energetic particle confinement (i.e. Alfvén eigenmode stability) in high-performance regimes that include steady-state and advanced tokamak scenarios. Furthermore, these systems will be fully compatible with today’s most challenging non-inductive heating and current drive systems and capable of long-term operating in harsh environments, making them the ideal approach for diagnosing long-pulse and steady-state tokamaks."

Buehler, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Principal Investigator) Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has selected tungsten heavy alloy (WHA) for use as a plasma-facing material in the limiter subsystems of the SPARC device, where heat fluxes are expected to be in the ~5MW/m^2 range during a standard discharge. CFS has also undertaken an experimental study comparing pure W to WHA under high heat flux loading conditions. This work was done at Applied Research Lab (ARL) at Pennsylvania State University. Pure tungsten and WHA samples were loaded to heat fluxes ranging from 100 to 400MW/m^2 approach conditions expected during ELM and disruption transient events during normal operation of SPARC. The changes to the surface morphology were examined via scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Though no cracking was observed in the WHA, other material degradation mechanisms were present such as spallation and binder migration. Though the WHA can tolerate some degree of material degradation, which will occur during the transient events, progressive degradation is a concern. While failure rates and damage mechanisms have been extensively studied for pure-W materials under fusion-relevant conditions, studies on WHA material degradation and failure are not common. For successful SPARC operation it would be highly beneficial to be able to predict not only the lifetime of a WHA PFC, but also solve the inverse problem and have the capability to extend PFC lifetime by adjusting operating conditions of SPARC in response to operational history and predicted remaining lifetime. A general capability of predicting remaining lifetime for WHA PFCs, given operational shot and disruption history, does not currently exist. Using computational methods and machine learning, this INFUSE program will build a model that can predict lifetime of WHA PFCs. This proposal aims to leverage existing deep learning models, expertise and tools developed at MIT to study thermal and mechanical material properties in high heat flux environments, with radiation effects excluded, and apply them to the application of WHA in the SPARC and ARC tokamaks."

All mammals, including humans, display an alerting response to a novel visual stimulus that habituates with familiarity, but returns immediately when another stimulus is presented. This visual recognition memory (VRM) operates as early as the primary visual cortex (V1). Work in mouse V1 has shown that VRM is associated with changes in the dynamical state of layer (L) 4, but how these changes occur is unknown. New data suggest that essential modifications are complex and require participation of principal cells in L6 and multiple classes of interneurons, which until recently have been inaccessible to high resolution interrogation. We will use a multidisciplinary approach to address these challenges, combining neurophysiological analysis with advanced optical methods and computational modeling. We will build a multilayer V1 model with multiple inhibitory populations that incorporates available data and will be further refined by our experiments. We will combine these approaches to reveal the minimal circuit accounting for VRM. Intellectual Merit: We will uncover the complex cortical circuitry underlying the process of memory formation, a cutting-edge question in neuroscience. To this end, we will combine electrophysiology and novel methods for cell-specific imaging and manipulation, with a new class of V1 models that incorporate inter-laminar interactions. The French partner lab is expert in theory of sensory information processing in the primary visual cortex but has never worked on VRM. The Bear lab has not employed detailed cortical modelling. Such synergy is necessary to understand the mechanisms serving memory formation in sensory cortex. Broader impacts: The scientific objective of this program is to understand the cellular mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval. Results from these studies will fundamentally influence how we understand memory function, and consequently, will have a high impact on the field of learning and memory. Furthermore, since memory-related deficits are also seen in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, the findings will also be of interest to clinical researchers working in the field. In addition to the usual routes of dissemination via peer-reviewed publications, the outcome of our research will be communicated online at the World-Wide Theoretical Neuroscience Seminar (WWTNS), a weekly seminar series attended by global audience of students and postdocs. It will also be disseminated for a wider audience on ADDiCTS (Association pour la Diffusion Digitale des Connaissances Technologiques et Scientifiques), a monthly series of talks targeting general audience and health professionals. The partners of this collaboration are convinced that close interaction between experimentalists and theoreticians in neuroscience is essential to develop mechanistic as well as quantitative understandings of how the brain performs its functions. This is in fact a primary motivating force in establishing this collaboration. However, for such collaborations to be effective, experimentalists must be well aware of the approaches and challenges in modeling while theoreticians must be well acquainted with the experimental techniques, their power and the challenges they present. The proposed research has also the ambition to contribute to the training of a new generation of neuroscientists who will have all these qualities."

These characteristics are subject to degradation due to poor construction and installation practices, to environmental factors such as mechanical wear and hardware deterioration, to the limitation of pointing calibration techniques and some other factors. It is therefore critical to be able to assess the optical quality of the mirrors and provide full knowledge to plant managers about which heliostats are underperforming and should be corrected appropriately. The various methods that have been developed to date do not permit a rapid characterization of the heliostats optical quality and consequently negatively affect the solar field performance and cause substantial losses of revenue. The Non-Intrusive Optical (NIO) method is addressing this specific issue by providing an approach that enables a fast heliostats optical characterization without interfering with the plant operation. The proposed solution of the stated problem is to use Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to conduct an efficient and accurate optical survey of large-scale heliostat field. The imagery (videos and pictures) collected from the camera carried by the drone, capture the reflection of the central tower on the mirror facets of the heliostats. Using advanced computer vision algorithms make possible the computation of the optical performance of the heliostat through the analysis of the distortion observed on the pictures. In the proposed Phase I, we intend to initiate the maturation of the NIO toolset by accelerating both the data collection and the data processing in order to achieve the true promise of this technology. Our work will focus on multiple areas of improvements for the NIO approach: first we will leverage the power of General Purpose computing on Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU), which relies on the huge parallelism of current generation of graphic cards that will allow the NIO algorithms to be 30 to 100 faster than the current demonstration implementation; second, we will integrate machine learning techniques for part of the complex computational workflow to enable the automated identification of key images features. Lastly, we intend to assess the possibility to use swarms of drones for accelerating the solar field survey operations. Phase I seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed improvements, while Phase II would bring the NIO toolset to full commercial phase. With the current ambitious US and overall world push to a carbon neutral power generation, the central tower solar power plants technology is promised a bright future. With its ability to store energy economically in molten salt tanks, and the capability to reach high temperature for multiple purposes (more efficient power generation, Solar Thermochemical, Hydrogen production, thermal output) the technology can play an important part in the solar future. To reach its potential a key parameter is the need to characterize the tens of thousands mirrors’ optical performance and provide plant operators with the knowledge to correct poor heliostat performers. Today about two dozen central tower power plants are in operation in the world, with large number of new plants being currently in the design phase. The improved NIO toolset that we intend to bring to its commercial phase will be able to provide critical services to these solar plants. The use of this technology can help improve the solar plant efficiency by a few percentage points, thus lowering the LCOE."

We propose to use a combination of three main disciplines: 1) verified lifting; 2) program synthesis; 3) program dynamic analysis. Verified lifting provides correct-by-construction methods to transpile between di?erent program source representa- tions by inferring and manipulating semantic information. Lifting enables AESOP to be portable by extracting semantic information from existing code bases into a platform-agnostic representa- tion that can be re-targeted to di?erent architectures. Program synthesis provides powerful code generation methods for performance and portability, by using a combination of generating rules and search over program structures. We plan to use synthesis to provide data layout and code generation capabilities for a single kernel or well localized code module, in both shared- and dis- tributed memory settings. Once a kernel or module is ported, it needs to be incorporated into the larger whole application context. To further assist with data and control (function calls) portability and composability, we will explore a generator-based synthesis approach to assist with I/O API composability for data transformations and communication/synchronization operations. We will explore programming by examples and programming by demonstration approaches, together with approaches to infer and synthesize generalized code from (online) disjoint code bases. Finally, we will develop scalable approaches to enable dynamic program analysis. Our previous work demon- strates that hybrid static+dynamic analyses provide a very powerful tool for execution features extraction and optimizations of HPC distributed memory codes. We will provide optimizations for communication, synchronization, and scheduling, together with dynamic analysis to enforce on-the-fly correctness of code specialized for precision or synchronization. AESOP will develop high- and low-level program and domain representations as compilation targets, as well as portability meta-languages for communication/synchronization operations and precision/algorithmic tuning. Automated test generation is a cross-cutting topic in AESOP and we will employ a combination of dynamic analyses for path coverage and for extraction with automated test synthesis techniques. For demonstrations we will use a combination of full scale traditional HPC applications (ASGarD, NWChemEX, CCTBX, PeleC) together with data and graph analyt- ics applications and libraries from the HPC (GraphBLAS, biochemistry) and commercial domains (Pandas, TVM etc.).

Dr. Tori Z. Forbes, University of Iowa (Principal Investigator) Neptunium (237Np) is a radioactive actinide element that is found in commercially spent nuclear fuel and challenging to separate for long-term storage. In high oxidation states (V or VI), neptunium will form two strong bonds to oxygen atoms to create the neptunyl (Np(V,VI)O2+/-) cation. This cationic form is dominant in water and solid materials, but not observed for most other elements on the periodic table. The neptunyl cation controls the chemical and physical behavior of neptunium, but we currently have a limited understanding of how it interacts in water or solid materials. It is crucial to develop a greater fundamental understanding of neptunium chemistry to overcome challenges that occur during the during the reprocessing and storage of spent nuclear fuel and related waste forms. In this project we explore how interactions between the oxygen atoms on the neptunyl cation and neighboring ions or molecules (intermolecular interactions) can impact the spectroscopy, stability, and redox behavior of neptunium. The overall hypothesis is that intermolecular interactions controls the resulting spectroscopic signals, stability, and redox behavior of neptunium. This hypothesis will be tested through experiments with neptunyl chloride, acetate, and carbonate systems and use X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, calorimetric measurements, and electrochemical analysis. These tasks will be performed within the following research objectives: Objective 1: Identify conditions that result in perturbations of the spectral features of the neptunyl cation and evaluate the changes in the electronic structure. Objective 2: Evaluate the energetic changes as a result of intermolecular interactions with the neptunyl oxo group. Objective 3: Explore the impact of intermolecular interactions to influence the stability of Np(V), Np(VI), and Np(VII) in water. Results from the proposed research will provide a greater understanding of how intermolecular interactions between neptunyl cations and neighboring ions or molecules control the chemical behavior of neptunium in water or solid materials. These results can impact separation and reprocessing of commercially spent nuclear fuel and develop more advanced environmental transport modeling. The expected outcomes of for this work are greater chemical controls of neptunium within water and an increased understanding of radioactive actinide elements. This work will also provide the opportunity for graduate students to receive training on the safe handling of radioactive materials."

At the same time, increasing evidence indicates that commonly dominant ice crystal generation mechanisms are missing from even the most detailed microphysics schemes. In addition, the dynamical foundations of many convective parameterizations (plume physics) are being revisited, with increasing evidence that the physics of thermals better describe the fundamental aspects of convective dynamical processes. DOE's Tracking Aerosol Convection Interactions ExpeRiment (TRACER) campaign has been designed to simultaneously address these knowledge gaps by providing measurements that will constrain aerosol properties in the vicinity of isolated convective cells that will be simultaneously observed with a multi-wavelength polarimetric radar network, including rapid scan approaches that should be able to directly observe dynamical processes in fine detail. Since rapid scanning of tracked isolated cells has rarely been attempted, however, — and never to our knowledge with the additional objective of detecting response to varying aerosol — optimal scanning strategies have not yet been established. A related objective of TRACER is rapid and high-resolution detection of lightning flash rate, size, and energy, which are coupled to the kinematic and microphysical spectra of mixed-phase clouds, via Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) observations. Here we propose to establish an initial science framework that connects cell-tracking radar measurements, lightning measurements, and high-resolution forecast modeling during the TRACER campaign. Objectives will be to better establish leading observational targets before the IOP period (e.g., most relevant height range for radar scanning, general size of identifiable observable elements, relationship to flash activity), conduct daily forecast simulations during the IOP period for operational readiness, and evaluate initial results and troubleshoot as the IOP period progresses. This will be accomplished by enhancements to the Houston LMA (2 additional stations), detailed analysis of lighting and polarimetric radar, and a comprehensive modeling study using the NASA-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) model with lighting-predicting microphysics. Thunderstorms will be tracked in two dimensions, and three-dimensional thermal tracking will be performed on simulated storms. Analysis will be organized around a conceptual model for the microphysical and dynamical evolution of isolated thunderstorm cells in the Houston region. Outcomes: Our work will shed light on poorly-understood processes that occur in isolated thunderstorms, linking the dynamical features of updraft thermals to their associated microphysical processes (e.g. initial formation of rain, glaciation, and production of graupel through riming), as well as the closely related processes of thunderstorm electrification, and their modulation by environmental aerosols. Observational and modeling analysis will be linked through a conceptual model of updrafts and isolated thunderstorm evolution. This will effectively inform targeting of observational resources during the TRACER field campaign. Enhanced gridded radar and lightning products will be produced, and a large database of high-resolution, lighting-aware, modeling studies will also be made available to the community."

Our approach will combine direct measurements of low volatility precursors and size-resolved ultrafine (sub-100 nm diameter) particles together with measurements of gas-particle partitioning of ambient vapors onto size-selected nanoparticles of known composition, the latter using the Captive Aerosol Growth and Evolution (CAGE) chamber. Measurements from the CAGE chamber will directly inform model development of ultrafine particle growth by our research team. While the focus of this project is on the formation and evolution of new ultrafine particles, the measurements and insights gained will be directly applicable to the formation and evolution of larger particles, with implications for air quality and climate in this important urban region. The main hypothesis of the proposed project is that new particle formation and growth in the anthropogenically dominated Houston area will be controlled by different species than those we have previously found in well-characterized remote regions, such as in the northern boreal forests and the Southern Great Plains in the United States. In addition, we hypothesize that the high relative humidity (RH) typical of the Houston region plays an important, unexplored role in new particle formation at this site. This project will have three main objectives that will directly address our hypotheses. In Objective I, we will perform measurements of ambient gas and size-resolved ultrafine particle composition, as well as climatologically important particle hygroscopicity under sub- and supersatured water vapor conditions during TRACER. Leveraging other relevant observations, including convective transport, we will seek to understand the dominant species that participate in particle formation and their potential impacts on clouds and climate. Concurrently, in Objective II we will perform measurements of size-resolved growth of particles of known initial size and composition during TRACER using the CAGE chamber. Using the data from Objectives I and II, Objective III is to build a process-level model that describes new particle formation in the Houston atmosphere, comparing model predictions of size-resolved ultrafine particle growth with measurements in order to test our mechanistic understanding of particle formation in this region. As part of Objective III, we will work with Department of Energy research partners to incorporate our mechanisms into regional and global models."

Achieving these outcomes requires harnessing coupled reaction pathways to simultaneously synthesize targeted molecules in the fluid and solid phases in a single system. One example in this context is the directed synthesis of H2 and Ca-or-Mg-bearing carbonates in gas-liquid-solid environments starting from the reactants in the water gas shift reaction which are CO and H2O, and earth abundant minerals such as forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and wollastonite (CaSiO3) as the chemical building blocks. However, in far from equilibrium environments, critical scientific insights into the reaction pathways remain locked in transient kinetics. To address this challenge, we propose to create a multi-modal non-invasive experimental strategy that harnesses synchrotron X-ray scattering and tomography techniques. This experimental methodology allows us to probe and link structural and morphological transformations in multiphase environments to the kinetics at far-from-equilibrium and at equilibrium conditions. This research approach will allow us to develop a chemo-morphological basis for designing targeted reaction pathways to direct the synthesis of clean energy carriers such as H2 while capturing, converting and storing CO2 as Ca- and Mg-carbonates."
Achieving Long Range Ordering in Oxide-Metal Hybrid Materials¿A Combined Experimental and Modeling Approach,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020077,"Wang, Haiyan",Haiyan.Wang@purdueuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Achieving Long Range Ordering in Oxide-Metal Hybrid Materials —A Combined Experimental and Modeling Approach PI: Haiyan Wang Co-PI: Anter El-Azab Institution: Purdue University Ordered, high-density metallic nanopillars in oxide matrices offer nanoscale composites with applications in nanodevices such as high-density magnetic storage devices and reader heads and in thermoelectrics. Nanostructures of this type are often fabricated through multiple steps involving laser patterning, e-beam lithography, or focused ion beam (FIB). These methods are limited to small patterning areas, low resolutions (typically in 50-100 nm), and slow speed. In this project, we propose to use Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) growth, guided by computational modeling, to circumvent these limitations and achieve highly-ordered nanoscale metallic pillars in oxide matrixes. Specifically, we aim to achieve single-step, direct growth of self-assembled oxide-metal epitaxial nanocomposite systems with both in-plane and out-of-plane ordering of metal nanopillars in an oxide matrix. The proposed effort builds upon our successful current project demonstrating several oxide-metal hybrid thin films including: ZnO-Cu, ZnO-Au and ZnO-AuxAg1-x, BaTiO3-Au, BaTiO3-Fe, BaTiO3-AuxAg1-x, La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)-Au, and many others, all of which have novel optical, electrical and magnetic anisotropy properties, as well as the feasibility of in-plane ordering by a substrate template method. Our research hypotheses are: (1) The ordering, spacing, and density of the metallic phase in the oxide matrix are determined by the interplay between the surface energy, in-plane strain, and interfacial energy of the two phases and substrate, as well as the deposition kinetics. Through precise control and exploration of the nucleation mechanisms, one can achieve precise in-plane ordering for many of the oxide-metal nanocomposite systems. (2) The atomic structure of the oxide-metal interface could play a critical role in the morphology of the two-phase systems and their overall physical properties, especially the coupling properties, such as magneto-electrical, magneto-optical and strain-optical, and phase change properties. The Objectives are (1) to combine the surface energy and strain energy factors to explore the potential in long range ordering with various nanopillar spacing, pillar dimension and density through a combined experimental and computational effort; (2) to use the alloy pillar systems as a probing method to investigate the defect nature at both the film/ substrate interfaces and the metal/oxide vertical interfaces, and their effects on the nucleation and growth and the strain state in the hybrid films; and (3) to perform computational modeling of growth and stability of oxide-metal systems and use this modeling to guide PLD growth experiments. We will explore the thermodynamic and kinetic factors on the overall pillar growth morphologies. The proposed work focuses on the design and processing of novel oxide-metal films with unique functionalities. Impacts of the work include: (1) The work will provide a basic understanding of the growth of these films and guidelines of the materials design of self-assembled and template-guided growth of pillars-in-matrix films configurations at nanoscale, for a wide range of applications in optical, plasmonic, piezoelectric devices and in catalysis. (2) The computational models developed in conjunction with our experimental effort will have broader impacts extending to systems beyond oxide-metal nanocomposite systems, e.g., oxide-oxide and nitride-metal systems as well as battery systems. (3) Applications in device and energy storage (e.g., thermoelectric energy) are expected. The work fits in the DOE-BES mission to foster and support fundamental research that expands scientific foundations for new and improved energy technologies and mitigating the environmental impacts of energy use. (4) The program will also help prepare future workforce in the broad range of materials for energy applications."
Developing Multi-Scale Models for the Effective Design of Bimetallic Catalysts for the Targeted Refinement of Bio-oil to Usable Biofuels,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0014560,"McEwen, Jean-Sabin",Jean-Sabin.McEwen@washingtonstateuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Developing Multi-Scale Models for the Effective Design of Bimetallic Catalysts for the Targeted Refinement of Bio-oil to Usable Biofuels Jean-Sabin McEwen, Associate Professor, PI Di Wu, Assistant Professor, Co-PI Voiland School of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering Washington State University Pullman, WA 99164 The efficient conversion of renewable energy sources requires an expansion in our understanding of fundamental chemistry. This is particularly true with respect to catalysis, and in the context of targeted refinement of bio-oil to usable biofuels. This refinement is necessary because of the high oxygen content in bio-oil. The presence of oxygen causes the bio-oil to exhibit undesired properties, such as low volatility, corrosiveness, thermal instability and a tendency to polymerize under exposure to heat and air. Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation can remove oxygen, and thus minimize these deleterious properties, but typical approaches use expensive and rare metals that also produce a significant amount of unwanted hydrogenated products. One way to accelerate advances in catalytic approaches is to use modeling ahead of the empirical testing, even down to a computational description of the processes that occur on the surface of a single catalytic grain. Most models fail to consider that a catalytic grain contains several single crystal planes that are simultaneously exposed at its surface. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop comprehensive models that span several length scales that take into account those physical realities. The objective of this project is to develop models that are based on realistic experimental conditions to predict the catalytic behavior of inexpensive and earth abundant catalysts. The central hypothesis of the project is that the chemical modification of first-row transition metal catalysts with minimal amounts of pure precious metals will demonstrate theoretical efficiencies that are superior to pure precious metal catalysts. To achieve this objective, a close correlation between experiment and theory on model catalysts will be performed to reduce both the computational expense and experimental efforts in characterizing these complex systems. This will lead to the identification of the key predictors in the electronic character of transition metal promoters that can be used to develop new, cheaper, and higher performing earth abundant-based metal catalysts toward the targeted refinement of bio-oil to usable biofuel."

With the advent and rapid advances utilizing 2D-materials as a platform to create novel nanostructures, the study of such phases of matter has entered an exciting new chapter. The ability to engineer correlations and topology using crystalline monolayer materials and their stacks has become a powerful approach to creating new quantum phases in materials. The discovery of superconductivity and plethora of correlated and topological phases in bilayers of graphene that are stacked and twisted at a magic-angle has catalyzed this emerging area of research in materials physics. The possibility that these chemically pristine materials can elucidate long-standing puzzles, such as understanding high temperature superconductivity in correlated electron systems, is tantalizing. At the same time, the opportunity to create fundamentally new phenomena, such as strongly correlated topological phases without a magnetic field that host exotic quasiparticles, is motivating further exploration of 2D materials and their stacks. Here, the PI has proposed to bring a wide range of atomic scale imaging and spectroscopic techniques with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) to elucidate the novel quantum phenomena in two classes of 2D materials and their stacks. Many of the high-resolution spectroscopic techniques that will be used were developed under DOE support to explore the complex physics of cuprates and other strongly correlated material systems. With the DOE support, the PI and co-workers have re-tooled these probes to examine quantum devices made from 2D materials, which in the last award cycle has had tremendous impact in the exploration of such systems. This research project expands on these advances to understand correlated, topological, and superconducting phases in two classes of 2D quantum materials. This research will explore the rich physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) and monolayer WTe2 and their stacks with high-resolution techniques. This research will answer fundamental questions as to the nature of superconducting, correlated, and topological phases in these material systems. The project will also expand on the application of new microscopy and spectroscopy techniques — from novel methods of analysis that the PI’s group successfully utilized with their recent direct observation of topological defects in correlated quantum phases of monolayer graphene at high magnetic fields — to the development and deployment of new experimental tools. The research team will establish capabilities for millikelvin atomic force microscopy (AFM), develop charge sensing microscopy and spectroscopy techniques using monolayer graphene as a sensor, and implement scanning noise spectroscopy to explore the novel quantum phenomena in crystalline devices. A suite of high-resolution STM instrumentation available at the PI’s lab will make the research possible. The experimental efforts will also take advantage of a 2D materials fabrication lab that was constructed to create the various samples proposed in this study. The STM research complements on-going transport studies of 2D materials carried out by many other groups in the field by probing with high-resolution the structural and electronic properties of these systems on the atomic scale."
Anisotropy and Residual Stress in Crustal Rocks:  Comparison of Microstructural Data with Experiments,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-FG02-05ER15637,"Wenk, Hans-Rudolf",Hans-Rudolf.Wenk@theregentsofuniversityofcalifornia,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Large parts of the Earth are anisotropic for the propagation of seismic waves. This applies particularly to the crust due to alignment of crystals during their geological history and oriented fractures forming by tectonic processes. In order to interpret arrival times of seismic waves and use them to interpret the structure at depth, this anisotropy has to be taken into account. It is particularly important for sedimentary rocks such as shales, transforming to slates and schists. They have a high amount of platelet-like sheet silicates that become aligned during sedimentation and compaction. These rocks are very important for hydrocarbon exploration and geological CO2 sequestration. This project relies on new experimental methods to measure microstructures of anisotropic rocks using facilities at National Laboratories with synchrotron X-rays and neutron diffraction, combined with sophisticated data analysis such as the Rietveld method, in part developed at our Berkeley laboratory. Additional microstructural information is obtained from scanning and transmission electron microscopy, some at the National Center for Electron Microscopy at LBL. This information can then be used in models to predict anisotropy in complex multiphase rocks and compare it with observed seismic anisotropy. The project originally started with the investigation of shales, among them the famous Kimmeridge shale from the North Sea that was first investigated by Brian Hornby in 1998 with velocity experiments. Since then we have explored a wide range of shales to determine the influence of composition, porosity and crystal alignment on elastic properties. Shales transform to slates during low-grade metamorphism and it was a great surprise to discover that these fine-grained rocks composed of mica, chlorite and quartz display the highest alignment of crystals in any material, even more than rolled metal foils. We are planning to explore this slate orientation more quantitatively to better understand the reason for this unique microstructure. With such exceptional results, X-ray diffraction experiments had to be refined and the high energy beamline at APS provided excellent data. Obviously, with preferred orientation of 100 multiples of a random distribution (compared to ten multiples of random for conventional analyses) data processing had to be advanced and new software had to be implemented. We are making these approaches – synchrotron measurements, data analysis and quantitative modeling – available for general users through publications of tutorials, workshops and accommodating visiting scientists. A second discovery was the presence of residual stress in deformed rocks that can be measured with Laue X-ray microdiffraction at ALS. This permanent distortion of the crystal lattice produced by deformation can be used as a paleopiezometer, not only of stress magnitudes but also of stress orientation. A surprising result was that boudinage at the original boudin locality in the Belgian Ardennes was subjected to compressional, not extensional deformation. But this paleostress technique is very sophisticated and needs to be streamlined to become a reliable method to measure strain. We are planning measurements on experimentally deformed quartzites where the strain history is known. In the course of this research we have relied on the contributions of graduate students, collaborations with colleagues at Universities as well as National Laboratories. It has been a wonderful experience and advanced science as well as our careers. We solved some problems and documented progress in many publications but a typical experience is that, while you bring some projects to a conclusion, you always discover new problems which we do not understand and need to be solved. Another experience has been that our new methods apply not only to Earth sciences, but are useful for materials science and particularly cement engineering that rely on microcrystals. And even the anthropocene: our recent discovery of Hiroshima debris in beach sands with X-ray microdiffraction at ALS raised worldwide interest from magazines such as Spiegel, DailyMail, El Pais and National Geographic as well as DOE-News. We are currently working on identifying magnetic particles left over from the Hiroshima blast."

Popielarski, Michigan State University (Co-Investigator) The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is a new user facility for the US Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE-SC) supporting the mission of the Office of Nuclear Physics in DOE-SC. The FRIB user facility was completed in January 2022 and the user science program has started. Stable and reliable operation of the accelerating structures (cryomodules) is essential in fulfilling DOE and science community expectations for FRIB operation as a user facility. So far, the FRIB cryomodules meet all of the design performance goals; however, during the facility lifetime, cryomodule performance degradation is possible, as seen in similar accelerator facilities such as CEBAF (Virginia) and SNS (Tennessee). If FRIB cryomodule degradation is observed, the under-performing cryomodules will need to be serviced or replaced. An inventory of spare FRIB cryomodules is needed to minimize future down time for such scenarios. Spare cryomodules with improved performance are highly desirable to provide additional performance margin in support of high availability and reliability. The proposed work is oriented toward developing new surface treatments to increase the usable accelerating voltage of spare FRIB cryomodules and provide a performance margin of 30 to 50%. In the proposed project, we will investigate multiple approaches to improved cavity performance and seek a better understanding of limiting mechanisms. Areas to be investigated are (i) innovative etching techniques for producing a high-quality superconducting surface on the inside of the cavity; (ii) low-temperature heat treatment to reduce the surface power dissipation in the cavity; (iii) methods to minimize magnetic flux trapping in the cavity under realistic conditions. The new etching techniques will expand upon existing electro-polishing and chemical polishing techniques, exploring different acid mixtures. Work on heat treatment will likewise expand upon recent advancements, exploring different temperatures and studying the role of dopants. The possibility of obtaining benefits similar to doping via purely chemical technique will be investigated as well. Although oriented toward improving FRIB cryomodules, the proposed work has the potential to generate understanding and techniques beneficial for other projects based on superconducting cavities for accelerators and other applications."

The resulting software tools achieve high performance on DOE computers and many have been incorporated into SciDAC simulation codes and elsewhere. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) FASTMath effort will focus on combining global and local surrogates for large-scale Bayesian inference. Local approximation MCMC (LA-MCMC) has proven broadly successful in accelerating Bayesian inference with computationally intensive models, but its initialization and scalability to high dimensions can be challenging in practice. Moreover, in many settings, one has precomputed an offline ensemble of forward model or likelihood evaluations and would like to exploit them fully. Also, “global” surrogate models—whether sparse polynomial expansions or neural networks—can have favorable approximation properties, despite lacking the sample-driven convergence guarantees of LA-MCMC. We will thus create coherent hybrid approaches that combine the best features of global and local surrogates. Our approach will emphasize scalability to high-dimensional parameter spaces and fast convergence. To this end, we will exploit dimension reduction methodologies and construct algorithms that can exploit asynchronous model evaluations on modern computing architectures."
Langevin Dynamics modeling of gas-phase ion-ion recombination,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021206,"Gopalakrishnan, Ranganathan",Ranganathan.Gopalakrishnan@universityofmemphis,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","The recombination of ions in the gas-phase plays an important role in the chemical composition, energy and charge balance of partially ionized gas environments such as flames, plasmas, inter-planetary gas clouds and ultra-cold (~few K) systems like cryogenics and quantum computers. Motivated by the lack of robust theoretical models of gas-phase ion-ion recombination, a holistic approach to modeling the recombination rate constant ßr that takes into account the ion-ion electrostatic interactions, ion-neutral gas molecule collisions and ion number concentration is proposed here. The modeling of elementary recombination reactions between a cation and an anion in the presence of a neutral gas is proposed here through the use of Langevin Dynamics and ion-pair specific potentials developed using the widely used Generalized AMBER Force Field (GAFF) combination rules. The use of translational and rotational Langevin equations to describe ion-ion motion implicitly captures the interaction between ions and neutral gas molecules through a systematic drag and thermal fluctuations due to diffusion, as well as explicitly accounts for ion-ion electrostatic interactions (force and torque on each other). This allows the reduction of a many body simulation (recombining cation, anion, and background gas molecules) to that of a two-body simulation (cation and anion) in the electrostatic and hydrodynamic force field (due to the gas molecules). A computationally inexpensive approach is described to obtain the recombination rate constant and to parameterize the same using scaling analysis for a wide range of gas pressures and temperatures of interest to aforesaid applications (p=100 Pa, T=1 K). Lastly, the effect of ion concentration n± will be systematically explored from the dilute limit (n± < 1015 cm-3) to the dense or strongly coupled regimes (1015 cm-3< n± < 1027 cm-3 such as those found in fusion plasmas or solar winds), investigating the electrostatically correlated motion of ions and implications for the recombination process. This computational research project will summarize Langevin Dynamics calculations of the recombination rate constant ßr into accurate predictive models that take into account the gas density (pressure and temperature), ion structure, ion-specific potential interactions, and ion number concentration to describe the chemical physics of ion recombination. To provide accurate inputs to the Langevin Dynamics calculation of ßr , the ionic structures will be determined using the Gaussian16® commercial package. The ion mobility or diffusion coefficient will be obtained from published experimental data or calculated using the IMoS ion mobility calculation package (developed by Prof. Carlos Larriba, IUPUI). The analysis procedure described in the proposal allows the parameterization of Langevin-inferred ßr into accurate expressions that converge to the high-pressure (p?8 or continuum) and low-pressure (p?0 or kinetic) limits of ion recombination. The ßr models developed as part of this project will be validated against the experimentally measured recombination rate constants from published experimental datasets identified in the project narrative. In this project, one graduate student will be involved (for the entire project period) and one undergraduate student will be involved (for three months a year for all three project years), supervised by the PI."

Shiraiwa, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory ((Institutional Principal Investigator) The “advanced tokamak” reactor concept is a leading candidate for a steady state fusion pilot plant. An advanced tokamak (AT) sustains a majority of the required plasma current with effects resulting from maintenance of the peaked pressure at the device center. This current is augmented by auxiliary current drive sources. These auxiliary actuators may consist of neutral particle beams and/or radio frequency (RF) systems such as lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) and high harmonic fast wave (HHFW) current drive using radio and microwaves from antennas. Control of advanced tokamak operating scenarios requires detailed information on the RF current drive profile in order to maintain an overall current profile that is stable to kink-like instabilities. The primary focus of this work is to develop models of RF current profile control suitable for use in integrated modeling frameworks and for real-time control in experiments. Several approaches have been used to simulate the RF current drive profile in tokamak plasmas. Analytical and reduced numerical (e.g. the adjoint method) models provide a reasonable estimate of the total driven current but lack key physics necessary to determine the current profile shape that can only be realized by solving the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. Moving upward in complexity to combined ray tracing/FP modeling includes the necessary physics for accurate current profile prediction of lower hybrid current drive, but at a level of computational complexity that requires ~minutes to simulate a particular plasma condition, while use in real-time control requires computation turnaround on the order of ~milli-seconds. While very high harmonic (frequencies many multiples of the ion cyclotron frequency) fast wave current drive methods known as helicon waves are amenable to ray tracing, typical HHFW actuators need full-wave modeling with simulation times on the order of 10s of minutes to hours on parallel systems. In order to achieve predictive times appropriate for the thousands of calls needed in real-time control of experiments and for use in integrated models, we will apply modern machine learning (ML) techniques to accelerate these models and interpolate their results. The full-wave solvers needed for HHFW are performance limited by the time to directly invert the large matrices they generate. By using machine learning methods to generate and optimize preconditioners to solve the matrix equations with iterative techniques, we can create solvers that have more favorable performance resulting in solution times on par with ray tracing models used in LHCD. To generate the fast and accurate models for use in control level algorithms and integrated modeling we need to replace full-wave and ray tracing/FP models with high dimensional interpolation of results from these models. A framework (piScope) has been developed previously and used to generate large parametric scans of ray tracing/FP simulations for the EAST tokamak. We will perform additional simulations across a broader parameter range for EAST and other tokamaks in different physics regimes (Alcator C-Mod, DIII-D, WEST, CFETR, ARC, ITER) and combine them into a larger database for training and testing of the ML models. Further testing of the control level models with experimental current profile data from EAST and C-Mod tokamaks will provide additional confirmation of the control level model before integration in a tokamak control system or integrated modeling suite. ML will be used to optimize the selection of training data consisting of RF current driven at different values of density profile, temperature profile, plasma current, and wavenumber. ML will also be used to facilitate classification of current drive from these input data. The output of this effort will be a validated classifier capable of determining the current drive profiles for HHFW CD and LHCD on a mille-second timescale. This will provide a breakthrough capability enabling real-time control of RF driven current profiles in experiments including ITER ICRF and use integrated modeling frameworks requiring thousands of current profile calculations in discharge simulations."

Nanostructured porous tungsten (W) PFCs can provide one possible platform to deliver Li to the surface in a controlled manner compared to fast-flowing liquid Li approaches that carry with them intrinsic risk and safety concerns. We will investigate a robust architected porous W interface that can introduce small amounts of Li whereby the first few microns is permeated with Li by 100% wetting of W surfaces provided by nanopatterned structures designed to maximize Li wettability. A multi-institutional team consisting of three universities will advance the science of liquid-metal (LM) research in NSTX-U for architected porous refractory metal substrates used with liquid Li PFCs. The focus of this project is on surface science research and liquid metal plasma-facing component development in the NSTX-U. Lithium-based LMs (e.g. Li, Li-Sn alloy) and candidate porous W substrate materials will be studied and developed over the course of the project. This research will also identify optimized porous W architectures ultimately providing sample modules for testing in NSTX-U plasma environments and future designs for possible deployment in NSTX-U. The collaborative team is organized as follows: 1) Dr. J. P. Allain of Penn State University will lead the development of novel engineered refractory-metal substrates that can enhance LM interaction and study the dynamics of wettability of the LM on these substrates; 2) Dr. B. E. Koel of Princeton University will lead studies of fundamental properties of LM PFCs including surface chemistry at temperatures seen and foreseen in NSTX-U; and 3) Dr. K. B. Woller of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will lead studies of compositional changes and hydrogenic retention under high-fluence plasma exposure. This project addresses key aspects of the NSTX-U mission and plans by the study of so-called slow-flow or “hybrid” technologies providing liquid Li (low-Z) pre-filled refractory metal (high-Z) plasma-facing component materials and establishing an understanding of their surface and PMI properties for use in NSTX-U. In addition to establishing a physics basis for these PFCs, this proposal will help establish the engineering basis of future PFC divertor upgrade(s) preparing for the next NSTX-U Five-Year Plan (2026-2030) whose central element would be a Liquid Lithium program."

Relativistic heavy-ion collisions and experiments such as PREX here on Earth are probing the nature of matter under extreme conditions. The nuclear physics involved in the creation of the heavy elements will be more tightly constrained as FRIB comes online in the next years. However, as observations and laboratory measurements improve, so must the theoretical understanding of NS mergers in order to maximize the science return from these large scale investments. Ab-initio supercomputer simulations are the only tool able to bridge astronomical observations and laboratory experiments and connect them to the merger dynamics. Current simulation results are affected by large systematic errors stemming from the inability to resolve all spatial and temporal scales in mergers and by their approximate treatments of neutrinos. This project aims to overcome these limitations by developing a new simulation infrastructure able to leverage next-generation supercomputer hardware, enabling calculations at unprecedented resolutions and extending over long timescales. One of the key deliverables is a new neutrino transport solver including general-relativistic and quantum kinetic effects using the filtered spherical harmonics and Galerkin methods, some of the most sophisticated approaches developed in the applied mathematics and computational physics communities. This project develops the theory foundations needed to address some of the most pressing questions in nuclear astrophysics such as the nature of matter inside NSs and the astrophysical site of production of the heavy elements."

These observables provide a testing ground for the developments of nuclear theory and guide us in connecting our knowledge of the nuclear force with the underlying theory of the strong interaction, QCD. Laser spectroscopy techniques play a major role in this research as precision measurements of atomic spectra allow unique access to electromagnetic properties of nuclei with extreme proton-to-neutron ratios. These exotic nuclei exhibit distinct nuclear phenomena and offer a high sensitivity to test modern descriptions of the nuclear force, to investigate the violation of the fundamental symmetries of nature, and to search for new physics. In recent years, the PI and collaborators have performed several developments of laser spectroscopy techniques for the study exotic isotopes, allowing measurements of nuclear properties for isotopes produced at rates as low as a few tens of ions/s. The recently developed Collinear Resonance Ionization Spectroscopy (CRIS) experiment at ISOLDE-CERN has enabled the study of exotic atoms and molecules containing nuclei in extreme regions of the nuclear chart. This project will support the development of laser spectroscopy techniques at the new Facility for Rare Iosotope Beams (FRIB) in the US. In a joint effort with the local group at FRIB, our group will implement the CRIS technique in this facility. These developments will be combined with the extensive capabilities offered by FRIB, providing access to unknown nuclear properties at the extremes of existence. This research project will allow different laser spectroscopy studies of indium (Z=49) and tin (Z=50) isotopes around the suggested neutron closed shells N=50 and N=82. These isotopes represent the current frontier for the application of state-of-the-art ab initio calculations, and their properties can also be accessed by different theoretical methods. Hence, experimental knowledge of isotopes, particularly those around the suggested doubly-magic isotopes 100Sn and 132Sn, is of marked interest in nuclear structure physics. Complementary to atomic spectroscopy, precision experiments in molecular systems have the potential to offer access to yet-to-be-explored parity- and time-reversal violating nuclear properties. As these symmetry-violating effects scale with the atomic number, nuclear spin and nuclear deformation, molecules containing heavy radioactive nuclei such as radium (Ra) are predicted to provide superior sensitivity in these studies. However, experimental properties of such radioactive systems are scarce, and quantum chemistry calculations often constitute the only source of spectroscopic information. This project will enable pioneering experimental studies of radium-monofluride (RaF) molecules."

In the traditional approach, a major conceptual simplification is afforded by studying many-body systems close to (thermal) equilibrium at long distances and low temperatures – a wildly successful enterprise that has led to the discovery of many novel phases of matter ranging from exotic superconductors to topological insulators. More recently, a confluence of theoretical and experimental advances across a range of subfields in physics has opened up a vast new territory of studying many-body phenomena in completely novel regimes: highly excited, quantum coherent, and far from equilibrium. In these settings, most well-established methods in quantum many body theory do not apply. Our understanding of even fundamental questions of quantum statistical mechanics, such as whether or how isolated quantum systems can bring themselves to thermal equilibrium under their own dynamics - or fail to do so - is still nascent. From the perspective of condensed matter physics, an exciting new opportunity entails understanding the new kinds of emergent universal many-body phenomena that can arise once the strictures of equilibrium thermodynamics are relaxed. A paradigmatic example is the recent discovery of time-crystals – a phase of matter disallowed in thermal equilibrium – in the intrinsically out-of-equilibrium setting of a periodically driven, many-body localized system. This research spans three broad research thrusts: (i) formulating and understanding the full range of `dynamical universality classes', and the novel phase transitions between these; (ii) exploring new kinds of phenomena that may be realized out-of-equilibrium; and (iii) formulating new information theoretic approaches for studying many-body quantum dynamics. In all, this wide-ranging research plan aims to push the exciting and interdisciplinary non-equilibrium quantum frontier using a variety of analytic, numerical and information theoretic approaches."

A compact sensor module for the next generation of monitoring systems is being developed to provide high energy resolution to detect, identify, locate, and track gamma ray emissions over a wide energy range. These sensors provide benefits in size, weight, power utilization, computational sophistication, and cost that will allow them to be deployed on hundreds of small satellites. Prototype sensor modules were designed and built in Phase I, based on europium-doped strontium iodide and a variety of other scintillators. All of the electronics for light collection, digitization and accumulation of calibrated energy spectra are contained within each sensor module. These prototypes demonstrated the feasibility of low-power, compact sensor modules capable of sustaining high-performance gamma spectrometry in challenging environmental conditions. When connected together, the prototype sensor modules automatically coordinate to share and combine spectral measurements, before streaming the combined results to a host computer. This interconnection capability is being developed because significant performance enhancements may be obtained by combining the outputs of multiple sensor modules. When modules are combined into an array, the larger detector volume provides increased gamma sensitivity, such that more information is obtained in less time. An array of multiple sensor modules would also be able to estimate the direction of gamma radiation through the self-shielding effect. In Phase I, a generalization of the self- shielding effect was developed to allow any arrangement of sensor modules to be easily programmed to locate the source of gamma radiation. Sensor modules will continue to be developed in Phase II, with further miniaturization and integration of the electronics, improvements in temperature-compensated energy calibration, and faster and more flexible module-to-module communications. The computational capabilities of the sensor modules will be extended to include background filtering, pulse-shape discrimination, and radioisotope identification. Prototypes of sensors arrays containing 12 to 28 sensor modules will be built in Phase II, including implementation and testing of the source direction sensing technique. The reliability of the sensors will be evaluated in Phase II through more extensive environmental testing. This research program will advance progress towards a new generation of smaller, lower- cost, higher-performance, space-based sensor arrays for nuclear detonation detection,localization, and radioactive residue identification, through improved gamma ray spectroscopy. The sensor modules developed in this program can be at low cost with low power consumption for space deployment. Arrays of sensor modules are being designed to fit on very small satellites, such as 3U CubeSats. The proposed sensor modules can also be configured for terrestrial applications ranging from spectroscopic personal radiation detectors to directional radioisotope identifiers."
Understanding the Mechanistic Roles of the Near-Surface Gas Phase and the Catalyst Surface in Oxidative C-C Coupling Reactions through Experiment and Modeling,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020320,"Kronawitter, Coleman","Coleman.Kronawitter@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,davis","['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis is predominantly focused on understanding chemical events occurring on the surfaces of catalysts; commonly, it is implicitly assumed that the gas phase only the serves the purpose of transporting reactants and products and does not directly participate in the reaction chemistry. In fact, events in the gas phase, as well as the dynamic exchange of species between the gas phase and surfaces, can have profound impacts on catalytic reaction outcomes – especially for the thermochemical conversion of hydrocarbons and oxygenates. The core objective of the work proposed is to develop and implement an integrated experiment-theory approach to provide new insights into the interconnected roles of the surface and the near-surface gas phase in heterogeneous catalytic oxidative coupling reactions. This work is enabled by use of (1) new research technologies, originally developed for the field of combustion science, which through recent adaptation now facilitate interrogation of the local, near-surface gas phase above catalyst surfaces in operando conditions; (2) site-isolated supported metal catalysts (often atomically dispersed), comprehensively characterized to define active sites and minimize site heterogeneity; and (3) DFT-derived microkinetic models to interpret reaction and materials characterization results from (1) and (2), deriving relationships between specific active site structures and local reaction outcomes. By targeting methane and methanol upgrading through coupling reactions, this research will yield more general conclusions that show how fundamental aspects of chemical transformations can be uniquely revealed by simultaneous consideration of events occurring on surfaces and in the near-surface gas phase. Through parallel efforts in the design, synthesis, and theory-guided experimental characterization of site-isolated catalysts with highly uniform supported metal coordination environments, this work will explore gas-surface structure-function relationships with a new perspective This new perspective and the specific outcomes of this work will yield insights into chemical steps that are ubiquitous throughout hydrocarbon and oxygenate catalysis – oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation, coupling, partial oxidations, free radical interactions, hydrogenations, and many more. The proposed work serves the additional purpose of bridging the work of existing DOE BES Catalysis Science projects at UC Davis and Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource with that of a DOE BES Gas Phase Chemical Physics project at Sandia National Laboratories."

However, combining particle-probe techniques that are not charge-state dependent open the possibilities of in-vivo diagnosis of the plasma-material interface in a fusion reactor environment where hydrogen isotope transport dictates fusion reactor operation. The reconstituted surfaces of plasma-facing components ranging from first-wall to divertor-component regions in the device vary depending on the complex plasma transport characteristics of the device. For example, in ITER it is predicted that fluxes of the order 1022 to 1024 m-2s-1 and incident charged-particle energies of 100&rsquo;s to 1000&rsquo;s of eV will reach the surface while in the divertor regions within the private-flux and near the inner and outer-strike points would vary from a few eV to 100&rsquo;s of eV governed by the complex Chodura magnetic sheath dynamics. This means that the penetration range of most charged-particle fluxes would range between 1-100&rsquo;s of nm (e.g. for fuel particles of D and T and He). Although diffusion-driven mechanisms will result in much deeper penetration of hydrogen in candidate materials, the dynamic accumulation and transport to and from the plasma-facing material interface will be critical in determining the burning plasma fusion operation window. Moreover, the surface chemistry and its impact on hydrogen transport recycled to the plasma or its transport to the bulk via permeation will also impact both fueling requirements and safety margins. Therefore, innovation in measurements that diagnose PMI in a few nm&rsquo;s to 100&rsquo;s of nm length scales with high resolution and sensitivity would be of interest given that the depth of origin of emitted species into the fusion plasma range between a monolayer to 50-100 nm and the characteristic scale of re-deposited surface films are from a few nm to 10&rsquo;s of microns. This &ldquo;High-Risk, High-Reward&rdquo; proposal will develop an innovative measurement approach combining three complimentary surface-sensitive techniques that enable in-vivo and in-situ characterization of the evolving re-constituted surfaces at the plasma-material interface. The proposed PMI innovative measurements suite consists of three novel complementary PMI techniques that would be implemented in a compact design and tested under simulated conditions to a tokamak plasma: 1) grazing emission X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (which uses photons for pump-probe surface spectroscopy) combined with an optical surface-stress probe, 2) a dual magnetic spectrometer for high-resolution RBS system and 3) Small-Angle Neutron Scattering with both transmission (SANS) and reflection (Neutron Reflectometry, NR) geometry setups. This powerful combination would yield a surface-sensitive diagnostic suite unequal in its ability to measure in-vivo the surface composition/chemistry with a probing depth of a few nm to 100&rsquo;nm and surface morphology and sub-surface defect dynamics of a few 10&rsquo;s nm to 100&rsquo;s nm. The suite would also intrinsically contain time-resolution in the order of a few microseconds to nanoseconds yielding critical information on the evolution of fuel retention and impurity-driven surface morphology and composition. Since X-rays and neutrons would not be influenced by the strong magnetic field gradients in a tokamak, the possibility for development of an in-vivo PMI diagnostic would be realized. These measurements could optimally guide wall conditioning approaches as well as novel PMI materials designs that would guide large-fluence, long-term materials operation and handling. Ultimately the long-term goal of this study is to establish the science and technology of using energy-disperse X-ray spectrum and neutrons for in-vivo surface characterization of the plasma-material interface in tokamak plasmas. These innovative measurements would also be critical to computational modeling validation."

This fraction is even higher on rural and tribal lands, and yet, solar penetration in these affordable housing markets is negligible. Phase3 Photovoltaics (Phase3PV) has been developing the concept of pre- installing solar and storage kits within manufactured home factories such that they can be shipped complete and operational along with the home. These turnkey systems are wholly inclusive of the entire balance of system components and dovetail into the energy efficient appliances through an intelligent power management hub. The aim of using mass-production practices, in a centralized facility, to dramatically lower the installation, permitting, and interconnection costs is gaining traction with homebuilders. The goal is to expedite the return on investment by maximizing self-generated power consumption at peak pricing times, such as by offsetting air conditioning loads in the summer months. An added benefit of this approach is that it provides solar power and energy equity to the most underserved portion of the U.S. market, so that they too can access the benefits of lower net monthly bills. Within the first one-year SBIR award, Phase3PV completed a market analysis that outlines the commercialization potential of introducing solar and storage kits to manufactured homes being built in factories. At a market opportunity of nearly 1.2 bUSD and growing at a rate of ~15% year over year, 48% of these homes are being placed in rural settings and nearly 65% of those buying these homes have median incomes under 40 kUSD. Several economical and technical challenges persist that Phase3PV will address in this Phase II SBIR project in order to fully unlock this opportunity: The roofing construction methods of prefabricated houses differ from those of site-built structures. Phase3PV made initial modifications to the racking, mounting and module frames to accommodate static and dynamic loading requirements of these specialized truss patterns, but further refinement is needed to optimize for the mass- production, factory environment. Phase3PV has devised an approach to quantifying the degree of windshear and road vibration that a manufactured home fitted with a solar array experiences during transport. Higher volume statistics are needed to confirm that Phase3PV solutions completely mitigate stressors on the solar kit. Phase3PV has developed automated templates that produce design and permitting documents, creating a streamlined process for builders to conduct subsequent builds of the same home model. A collection of repeat home builds is needed to verify these operational efficiencies. Previously, all these challenges were cited as roadblocks to implementing this approach by the largest nationwide builders. But after deploying (5) prototype modular and manufactured homes in various settings, it was the actual generation and consumption data that began to validate cost models. Immediate and favorable returns are indeed possible for a group of homeowners who were previously unable to access the benefits of solar energy. Those models also show conservative projections of $1.50/Wp installed system costs are feasible using this factory-based approach. To accomplish this goal, three key focus areas will be cultivated within this project to include: Validate a Large-Scale, Kit-Sales Approach to Cost Compression in a Mass Production Setting. Create a Design and Kit Assembly Center to Inject Value-Added Technologies to Standard Solar Offerings. Launch a Solar Roof BIPV Hybrid Product Customized for Manufactured Home Construction Practices. Follow-on work in this Phase II SBIR project is envisioned to encompass developer-led neighborhood builds of solar and storage equipped manufactured homes that coordinate power sharing to form a microgrid, thereby delivering a clean path toward local energy resilience."

This research will diagnose, and compare across ESMs, the role of coupled ocean-atmosphere processes and feedbacks, determine how they contribute to predictable PDV dynamics and how they are affected by unpredictable stochastic forcing, and evaluate mean state dependencies including those associated with anthropogenic external forcing. Approach: Testing an observationally-based hypothesis that outlines the dominant processes of Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV), we will examine the mechanisms and teleconnections that energize the modes of PDV in ESMs under historical and projected future conditions. The data and methods for this project include (a) data archives from the latest available CMIP, (b) data archives from existing large ensembles from ESMs (CESM, GFDL ESM2M, IPSL CM5A, and CanESM) (c) a hierarchy of reduced complexity stochastic models, (d) a set of simulations from a new hybrid coupled climate model based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and E3SM, and finally (e) a 15-member large ensemble of the DOE E3SM v1 model, newly generated in this project, where each member undergoes the same historical/projected 1850-2100 external forcing. Our approach is to first construct an integrated stochastic model that incorporates the mechanisms and teleconnections of the observationally-based hypothesis, using it to quantify and synthesize the dominant pathways energizing PDV in each ESM. Next, individual processes of PDV in the tropics (e.g. stochastic forcing, ENSO precursors and feedback dynamics) and extra-tropics (e.g. tropical/extra-tropical teleconnections, stochastic forcing and memory dynamics) will be further examined using the hybrid simulations and advanced budget analyses. The influence of anthropogenic external forcing (e.g. changes in mean state) will also be investigated using similar approaches applied to the existing large-ensemble simulations from CMIP5-era models and the new CMIP6-era E3SM large ensemble. Substantial internal climate variability has been shown to impact regional estimation of forced signals within ESMs, requiring large ensembles for robust identification of the links between climate change and PDV. Our approach moves beyond simple statistical comparisons and analyses of the patterns of the PDV modes to deliver mechanistic understanding and synthesis of the dynamics and processes that energize their variance. Science Team: The PIs bring complementary expertise in the theory and stochastic modeling of PDV (Di Lorenzo, Newman), ENSO dynamics and sensitivity to climate change (Stevenson, Newman), hybrid coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling (Newman) and coupled climate modeling (Stevenson and Di Lorenzo). The PIs will also collaborate with Dr. Luke Van Roekel, an E3SM developer at Los Alamos National Laboratory, to conduct the E3SM large-ensemble and E3SM hybrid coupled simulations. Broader Implications: PDV controls both large-amplitude transitions in marine ecosystems and the statistics of climate and weather extremes in the Pacific basin. More recently, PDV has been implicated as a driver of the warming hiatus, yet the mechanisms controlling its phase and predictability remain unclear because the wide-ranging expressions of PDV within ESMs have not been diagnosed from a mechanistic point of view. This proposal will provide the basis for a dynamical interpretation of the differences in the current suite of coupled climate models and associated representation errors. The improved understanding and modeling of the dynamics of PDV will provide a mechanistic-based framework for predicting societally relevant indicators linked to droughts, heatwaves, and ecosystem services. Furthermore, the tools and diagnostics developed in this project can be generalized for other regions (e.g. tropical Atlantic and Indian oceans) and will be made available through a project website. Additionally, the proposed work will result in a new E3SM 20th/21st century ensemble, which will be provided as a resource to the community, creating new opportunities for widespread use of E3SM results."

While traditional solar-energy conversion processes use light to directly perturb the concentrations of electrons and/or holes, few works have used light to perturb the concentration of only protons. This process is of particular interest because it is unique to photochemistry in that it does not (yet) have a productive analog in solid-state physics. Therefore, the planned research will interrogate the fundamental photochemistry of photoacid-dye-sensitized polymer membranes, where solely light-driven proton release will be used to drive solar photochemical reactions. The planned research will leverage photophysical and solid-state physics theories, techniques, and design strategies previously developed for the study of traditional solar-energy conversion processes.

The only known way to establish experimentally that the neutrino is a Majorana particle is through observation of the ultra-rare process of neutrinoless double beta decay. All experiments that have searched for this process to date have been plagued by backgrounds from ambient radioactivity in detector materials.

No such technology has yet been demonstrated.

Schadler, University of Vermont (Principle Investigator) Sanat K. Kumar, Columbia University (Co-Investigator) Brian C. Benicewicz, University of South Carolina (Co-Investigator) Composites consisting of spherical nanoparticles and a polymer matrix have shown considerable promise for improving the mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of polymers. One of the critical factors in achieving the properties is controlling how the nanoparticles are organized in the polymer matrix. Most prior work has focused on organizing nanoparticles in amorphous polymers, but 70% of all polymers sold annually are semicrystalline. Inspired by this apparent disconnect, our work in the current DOE funded grant and this renewal proposal employs a novel handle, polymer crystallization, to organize NPs in semicrystalline polymers. We have found that by changing the rate of crystallization, we can control whether the nanoparticles are well dispersed, or are pushed in between the crystalline regions to form sheets of particles in the amorphous regions. We hypothesize that the isothermal crystallization rate and the nanoparticle diffusivity, are the two relevant control parameters in this context. We have established the broad applicability of this approach in two polymers, polyethylene (PE) and polyethyleneoxide (PEO). To achieve this goal we developed a method for attaching (grafting) long PE chains from NPs with controlled graft density and molecular weight, giving us the ability to tailor their dispersion in the PE melt prior to crystallization. In this renewal proposal, we will develop the fundamental, quantitative understanding that will allow us to independently tailor polymer crystallization rate, NP diffusivity and NP agglomeration state in semicrystalline polymers so as to facilely control NP ordering and hence properties. More specifically we will focus on three areas: Quantifying the relationship between particle diffusivity (by altering the grafted chain density and molecular weight, and by using a bimodal population of brushes on the NP) and the critical crystallization rate. Manipulating crystallization rates by controlling graft chemistry: We have found that the stereoregularity of the grafted chains is critical in controlling the crystallization rate. Apparently, crystalline grafts can co-crystallize with the matrix and speed crystallization kinetics; amorphous grafts on the other hand hinder crystallization. In addition, by organizing the fillers in the melt, we have shown we can alter the nucleation and crystallization rate when the sample is cooled below its melting point. Understanding the fundamentals of both these phenomena is critical to controlling NP organization and therefore properties. Zone Annealing: Manufacturing protocols require that polymers are extruded and then directionally crystallized in the presence of flow (and temperature) gradients. To mimic these practically more relevant synthesis protocols, we have designed a flow setup, modeled on the zone annealing (ZA) method to directionally solidify polymer nanocomposites. As expected, this protocol yields spherulites that are elongated in the flow direction. We will develop an understanding of how flow induced orientation impacts the crystallinity (initial results suggest it is higher) as well as use it as a method to create larger scale alignment of the lamella (and thus the filler sheets)."

The microscopic chemical processes that enable this interconversion are sensitive to the chemical, physical, and compositional properties of their anisotropic molecular environment. The goal of this proposal is to develop new theoretical models and simulation methods for studying the nanoscale properties of electrochemically active solid-liquid interfaces. These models and methods will expand our capability to study the properties of electrochemical systems using molecular simulation so that their effects can be more accurately accounted for when analyzing and interpreting experimental data. In this project, we focus specifically on (1) developing a better understanding of the fluctuating disordered molecular environments that are inherent to electrode-electrolyte interfaces, and (2) identifying the fundamental role that these fluctuations play in shaping the rates and mechanisms of electrochemical reactions. Our approach utilizes all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations that include reactive electrode boundary conditions with tunable potentials. With these boundary conditions, we can generate nonequilibrium driving forces that mimic those of typical experiments. We analyze simulation data to identify the general physical consequences of molecular fluctuations and incorporate them into more efficient theoretical frameworks, such as those based on micro-kinetic modeling. The project is organized around three specific research objectives. The first objective is to develop methods for performing and analyzing atomistic simulations of driven electrochemical interfaces. The second objective is to characterize the molecular fluctuations of the electric double-layer. The third objective is to model the role of interfacial solvent fluctuations on electrochemical reactions that involve electrode-bound intermediate states. These objectives address important longstanding challenges in theoretical electrochemistry. Nanoscale properties of the electrode-electrolyte interface are known to influence the rates and mechanisms of interfacial chemical reactions, as well as the transport of reactive species to and from the interface. Advances in our fundamental understanding of the electrode-electrolyte interface will allow us, and others, to more effectively leverage this influence for improving existing energy technologies and catalyzing the developments of new ones."

Information from these studies improves our understanding of nuclear structure properties which are needed as input to such widely varied areas as fundamental nuclear astrophysics and applied nuclear reactor design, where it is important to determine the generation of heat within a nuclear reactor core on short time scales. However, there are significant limitations of our knowledge due to an inability to experimentally measure everything. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on theoretical calculations which need to be vetted with experimental results. The purpose of this proposal is to perform detailed beta-decay spectroscopy measurements for a small number of nuclei to better understand the shortcomings of our current knowledge and how these shortcomings could be estimated for other nuclei. To achieve this goal, we propose two primary activities. First, the analysis of archival beta-decay data to extract additional information for all members of a decay chain. Beta-decay spectroscopy measurements at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory produced data sets related to the specific parent nuclide of interest, but also for all members of the decay chain. We have found that new and significant information can be found for the members of the decay chains closer to stability which were assumed to have been measured in detail previously. Specifically, we have found discrepancies between our results and those in the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF) database compiled by the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC). We have finished the analysis of this data with several publications in preparation. Second, the development of experiments to study specific properties of excited states fed by beta decay. This includes level lifetime and conversion electron measurements to pin down spin/parity assignments. All experiments would utilize large-volume germanium detectors in close geometry to maximize efficiency providing gamma-ray singles and gamma-gamma coincidence data. Ancillary detectors will be used to better resolve gamma rays with energies below 200 keV, to measure conversion electrons, and to measure level lifetimes depending on the nuclide to be studied. The Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU) facility at Argonne National Laboratory has a new beta-decay experiment station in a low background room which will allow for these types of studies. Finally, proposals have been submitted to the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University to use the FRIB Decay Station Initiator (FDSi) for several beta-decay studies related to the proposed research. These experiments will generate a significant amount of data beyond that for the primary nuclides of interest, so data mining will be used to maximize the information that can be obtained from any one experiment."

The other method involves splitting the laser pulse into two beams and using the constructive interference to as much as double the intensity on target without requiring additional laser energy. The goal of both methods is to maximize the numbers and the energies of the protons and ions ejected from intense laser interactions.

Reed, US Geological Survey (Co-Investigator) Jennifer Pett-Ridge, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) Karis McFarlane, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) Xaiojuan Yang, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Senior Personnel) Hurricanes affect nearly every continent in the world and are among the most intense weather disturbances in forest ecosystems. In 2017, the coastal United States (US) and Puerto Rico were devastated by a series of major hurricanes that caused more than $200 billion in damages, which will have long-lasting implications for the economics and natural resources of US forests. At the same time, models project that temperatures in the tropics and subtropics will increase by 3-5 oC within the next 20 years. The combined effects of hurricane disturbance and warmer temperatures could fundamentally alter the trajectory and duration of forest recovery following disturbance, resulting in altered ecosystem states that are difficult to predict from historical data alone. Despite the immediate and significant effects of hurricanes on forest carbon and nutrients, as well as the potential to affect the long-term trajectory of forest recovery, hurricanes are not currently represented in Earth System Models, and no studies have captured the potential interactions of hurricanes within the context of a changing climate. To address this major knowledge gap, we will take advantage of a once-in-a-century opportunity to investigate the recovery of forest structure and function following a major hurricane disturbance under experimentally warmed conditions. We will leverage an already established field warming experiment in Puerto Rico (Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment [TRACE]), funded by the USDA Forest Service and the US Department of Energy, to capitalize on the experiment&rsquo;s wealth of pre-hurricane baseline data, including microclimate data before and during Hurricanes Irma and Maria, as well as multiple aspects of forest response following these major storms. TRACE is uniquely positioned as the first and only experiment in the world able to evaluate the combined effects of hurricane disturbance and increased temperature in a field setting. We will assess soil carbon, nutrients, and microbial processes along with plant physiology and chemistry in established warming plots impacted by hurricanes in order to address the following research questions: 1. Are there legacy effects of pre-hurricane experimental warming that persist after hurricane disturbance, or does the system &ldquo;re-set&rdquo; itself to new baseline conditions? 2. Will hurricane disturbance and increased temperature interact to generate soil and plant responses that fundamentally alter the trajectory of forest recovery? We will explore these issues both above- and belowground, drawing on a suite of research approaches. With this project, we would collect and synthesize some of the only data in existence that directly inform quantification, evaluation, and modeling of tropical forest responses to the interactive effects of disturbance and warming. Results would directly address DOE&rsquo;s mission to improve our understanding of globally important and environmentally sensitive processes in understudied ecosystems and to improve the quality of complex Earth and environmental model projections."

A wide array of states can arise in systems of strongly interacting electrons, including high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, electron crystals, and more. However, achieving a complete understanding of the physics of these strongly correlated states has been extremely challenging, as it is nearly impossible to exactly calculate the ground state of a large number of interacting electrons. As an alternative approach, these states can be “simulated” within a simpler model system that nevertheless captures the salient features of the full many-body quantum problem. Recently, a new class of promising quantum simulators has emerged, constructed by stacking and rotating various sheets of atomically thin van der Waals crystals atop one another. The geometric interference of the stacked crystal lattices results in the emergence of a moiré pattern, which acts as a synthetic lattice that can have characteristic length scales on the order of 10 nm. Recent work has shown that the Hubbard model can be simulated in moiré systems constructed from various transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) building blocks. However, the scope of the Hamiltonians that can be achieved is currently limited by restrictions in the shapes of moiré lattices that can be created. This research project will develop a new technique to modify the moiré geometry using various forms of in-plane strain, including uniaxial, biaxial, and shear strain. This approach will enable the simulation of a more general class of extended Hubbard model Hamiltonians with continuous tuning capabilities. The PI will integrate the strain platform into a scanning tunneling microscope, enabling atomic- and moiré-scale characterization of the emergent many-body physics in these systems as a function of controlled mechanical deformation of the samples. Using these newly developed experimental techniques, the PI will investigate an array of emergent strongly correlated states of matter realized in a number of different TMD moiré platforms, including aligned WSe2/WS2, and twisted bilayers of WSe2, WTe2, and TaSe2. After characterizing the strain-induced structural changes to the crystal lattices of the moiré structures, researchers will perform atomic-scale spectroscopic measurements to quantitatively extract the extended Hubbard model parameters as the samples are deformed. This research project will further investigate the effects of strain on various charge ordered states in these platforms, including charge density waves and generalized Wigner crystals. Finally, researchers will investigate the strain response of correlated states with spin–charge separation, including quantum spin liquids and arrays of one-dimensional Luttinger liquids. The impact of this research will be in the development of new experimental techniques enabling scientists to carefully control and probe strongly correlated states of matter on the atomic scale, as well as in providing a deeper understanding of the nature of these interesting many-body quantum phases."

X-wave Innovations, Inc. (XII), along with Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and TechOpp Consulting Inc.

The UMTS will offer multiple temperatures with single sensor unit. Our approach combines the concepts of material engineering and acoustic propagation in materials, delivering an ultrasonic temperature sensor which is resilient to radiation and can operate reliably with extend long operation life. In Phase I, XII will involve the development of prototype followed by performance testing and validation. The primary consideration will be given to the development of waveguide and adapter to achieve high signal to noise ratio. Improvement in the UMTS design will be made based on the performance tests and comparison studies. The outcome of the proposed work is an ultrasonic temperature sensor which will be capable to passively measure temperature at different points along the waveguide length in the harsh environments. The potential application of the proposed technology is in nuclear industry, such as, nuclear reactors (both domestic and military), nuclear waste management, and research.

These thermosetting polymers are known for their stable thermomechanical properties and excellent chemical resistance. However, thermosetting polymeric materials are intrinsically not recyclable because of their irreversible cross-linked network structure. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a recyclable thermoset polymer such as an epoxy with three important characteristics: (I) recyclable through depolymerization using light easily and energy efficiently; (II) thermomechanical properties suitable for additive manufacturing such as 3D printing; and (III) strength and stability of the final structure comparable to conventional epoxies. To accomplish this goal, we will combine three specific strategies. First, thermo-reversible thermosets will be synthesized and characterized for additive manufacturing by introducing a covalent adaptable network based on the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction into an epoxy material. At high temperature (> 110 °C), depolymerization occurs through the retro-DA reaction, and, as a result, the epoxy network turns into soft, mendable epoxy segments. Due to the reversible nature of the DA reaction, the epoxy segments can be polymerized again through formation of the DA cycloadduct. The molecular structure of the reversible epoxy will be carefully designed to tune their mechanical and thermal properties in the depolymerized segment state for 3D printing and also to achieve desired strength and stability for the final crosslinked structures in the finished product. Second, thermo-reversible epoxy will be mixed with multi-functional photothermal nanomaterials consisting of refractory plasmonic titanium nitride and magnetic metal such as nickel. The well-dispersed plasmonic nanomaterials in the epoxy matrix can act as a localized thermal source that will convert light into localized heat efficiently and rapidly to trigger the depolymerization. The magnetic properties of the nanoparticles will permit their easy separation from the epoxy matrix, if necessary, during recycling. Third, the reversible epoxy/nanoparticle nanocomposites will be evaluated with respect to their recyclability and processing conditions for 3D printing. Recycling of the reversible epoxy/nanoparticle composites will be evaluated by two different approaches depending on the application: First is subjecting the reversible epoxy/nanoparticle nanocomposite to depolymerization temperature to achieve liquid-like thermomechanical properties such as flowability for chemical circularity in 3D printing or any similar manufacturing method such as extrusion or injection molding. Second is dissolving the heated nanocomposite in solution recycling for recovering the DA epoxy monomers and the nanoparticles separately for other upcycling approaches. Feedback from the recycling studies will be valuable in improving the formulation of the recyclable epoxy. The outcome of this project will provide the foundation for developing a new class of recyclable epoxies. Additionally, the results from this research will provide the fundamental knowledge to characterize the complex reaction kinetics involved in thermally reversible DA-thermosets and to understand how that chemical process is accelerated via photothermal processes using plasmonic nanomaterials."

Periodic TPN assemblies are attractive nanostructures for many functional material applications that rely on their combination of symmetry and polycontinuous domain connectivity. Theoretical predictions to date almost exclusively point to a single class of equilibrium structures (i.e. cubic ‘double gyroid’ networks composed of trivalent nodal connections). Moreover, experimental realizations of BCP structures are prone to distortions that likely limit technological applications of TPN morphologies, from photonics, battery materials, and mechanical metamaterials. Predictive understanding is needed to engineer new TPN morphologies, from subdomain shapes to supra-domain symmetries and network topologies, in order to create high value functional materials through bottom-up processing of soft materials. The overarching objective of this project is to advance the principles that connect molecular designs of BCPs and the processing routes to successfully assemble TPNs of controllable symmetry, geometry and topology. Despite decades of study and powerful theoretical tools that rationalize and confirm broad equilibrium stability of double-gyroid in BCP melts, the ability to predictively direct synthesis of diblock or other macromolecular architectures to TPN structures beyond gyroids remains limited. The project addresses this challenge through a synergistic integration of theory of geometrically complex molecular assembly, state-of-the-art synthetic approaches to precisely defined architectures and innovative multiscale and quantitative 3D characterization methods of complex BCP domains. The research will test and advance two core hypotheses: The first proposes a new relationship between complex shapes of assembled domains and the arrangement of BCP chains in the structure. Testing and understanding the connection between complex domain shapes and underlying molecular arrangements will guide the design and synthesis of new molecular architectures that target novel TPN nanostructures. The second hypothesis addresses the complementary challenge of understanding how complex and inter-linked TPN phases grow and what are the key transformational pathways that determine their ultimate structure. Rather than chain-by-chain addition, we propose a new paradigm whereby TPN assemble by formation of multi-chain “mesoatomic” units, and in turn, these aggregate into ordered networks upon solvent evaporation."

Future development, enhancement, and use of these systems hinges upon an accurate theoretical description of the strong effects of quantum dynamics.

Carefully designed experiments can provide substantial savings for these expensive data-acquisition opportunities. However, designs based on heuristics are often suboptimal for systems with multiphysics, nonlinear dynamics, and uncertain and noisy environments. Optimal experimental design, while leveraging predictive models, seeks to systematically quantify and maximize the value of experiments. We focus on design of multiple experiments, where current approaches are largely suboptimal: batch-design does not adapt to new data acquired during the experiment campaign (no feedback), and greedy/myopic design ignores future dynamics and consequences (no lookahead). We propose to develop the mathematical framework and computational methods for sequential optimal experimental design (sOED) for complex systems. We seek to enable tractable model-based sOED in a rigorous and provably optimal manner through novel algorithms of reinforcement learning (RL), and incorporate quantified effects of the human experimenter into the experimental design utility via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to properly reflect what experimenters value in real-life decision-making beyond information gain. In short, we seek to ""compute sOED, and for the right goals"". Our methods will be fully Bayesian, able to quantify and update uncertainty in a principled manner.

Recent developments in ML, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have demonstrated that ML can effectively learn to perform a complex task when given plentiful data. However, for many applications in science and engineering autonomous decision-making systems require more adaptive learning. These problems require ML not only to be flexible enough to learn, but also adaptive so that it can learn without a fixed dataset or in the face of dyanmic conditions. These closed-loop ML systems will assimilate results from past choices to learn and improve an ML model, use this model to predict consequences of potential decisions, and act based on these predictions to optimize utility. Developing closed-loop ML will require developing beyond state-of-the-art methods for quantifying prediction uncertainty so that the effect of decisions can be evaluated. We propose to develop new learning algorithms, rooted in Bayesian theory, to support decision-making in closed-loop Machine Learning (ML) systems. We will achieve our objectives by developing algorithms for closed-loop ML, which quantify and control decision-affecting uncertainties using goal-oriented Bayesian learning. A goal-orient framework is critical because it simplifies learning decisions so that only information necessary for decision-making is retained. Robust closed-loop ML must be able to learn, predict, and act, in a provably optimal manner by taking into account of future decisions and consequences. Through a Bayesian approach, we will quantify uncertainty for ML models in a rigorous manner that is currently lacking. While fully Bayesian treatments for many ML models, like DNNs, are currently computationally intractable, our approach will enable them through 1) goal-oriented formulations of Bayesian inference and experimental design tailored to downstream decision-making; 2) variational approximation theory for fast Bayesian computing aimed at maintaining high-fidelity predictions; and 3) robustness to modeling assumptions in our learning framework. We will demonstrate our new framework and tools on a simulated physics-based scientific application of high-speed turbulence aerodynamic flows. Providing provable guarantees and rigorous uncertainties, will build confidence, trust, and contribute to the adoption of ML for scientific practices. This research will enable ML models to improve and accelerate critical science and engineering tasks like design optimization, optimal control, and optimization under uncertainty for complex systems.

In US Department of Energy (DOE) mission areas, the analyses, simulations, and optimizations of these complex systems have been the objectives of numerous past research efforts. In this proposal, we recognize the fundamental challenge of complex system modeling and control, which is that high-fidelity ab initio models can be prohibitively expensive to construct. This limitation is not necessarily due to the lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying natural phenomena but due to practical constraints such as the difficulties in instrumenting the complex systems to collect relevant data, the need to resolve inherent uncertainties in the models (e.g., due to unmodeled physics), and the loss of observability due to excessive exogenous noises. The general applicability of the current solutions is hampered by the ad hoc nature of the approaches and the lack of a coherent theoretical framework. In this proposal, we plan to develop a more unified theoretical foundation based on probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). PGMs are a rich mathematical formalism with theoretical connections to many tasks in machine learning, such as uncertainty quantification and reinforcement learning. PGMs are an active area of research. However, to leverage PGMs for the decision and control of complex systems, many open research questions remain, including model structure determination, model parameter estimation, and the foundational issue of analyzing uncertainties. To address these challenges, the research efforts in this project are organized into four interdependent technical thrusts: model construction, uncertainty quantification, decision and control, and continual learning. The focus of the first two thrusts is to develop theories and methods for construction of PGM-based complex system models based on observational data under multiple sources of uncertainty. The goal of the decision and control thrust is to develop a control mechanism for complex systems with uncertainty and limited observability by using techniques such as reinforcement learning. The continual learning thrust copes with the time-varying nature of the underlying dynamics of complex systems. A fifth thrust, application demonstration, is organized as a cross-cutting effort to develop the strategy for general applicability and validation of the research outcomes, and to conduct proof-of-concept demonstrations on applications from DOE mission areas, including building energy efficiency, reactor power control and science user facility control.

In US Department of Energy (DOE) mission areas, the analyses, simulations, and optimizations of these complex systems have been the objectives of numerous past research e orts. In this proposal, we recognize the fundamental challenge of complex system modeling and control, which is that high- delity ab initio models can be prohibitively expensive to construct. This limitation is not necessarily due to the lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying natural phenomena but due to practical constraints such as the diculties in instrumenting the complex systems to collect relevant data, the need to resolve inherent uncertainties in the models (e.g., due to unmodeled physics), and the loss of observability due to excessive exogenous noises. The general applicability of the current solutions is hampered by the ad hoc nature of the approaches and the lack of a coherent theoretical framework. In this proposal, we plan to develop a more uni ed theoretical foundation based on probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). PGMs are a rich mathematical formalism with theoretical connections to many tasks in machine learning, such as uncertainty quanti cation and reinforcement learning. PGMs are an active area of research. However, to leverage PGMs for the decision and control of complex systems, many open research questions remain, including model structure determination, model parameter estimation, and the foundational issue of analyzing uncertainties. To address these challenges, the research e orts in this project are organized into four interdependent technical thrusts: model construction, uncertainty quanti cation, decision and control, and continual learning. The focus of the rst two thrusts is to develop theories and methods for construction of PGM-based complex system models based on observational data under multiple sources of uncertainty. The goal of the decision and control thrust is to develop a control mechanism for complex systems with uncertainty and limited observability by using techniques such as reinforcement learning. The continual learning thrust copes with the time-varying nature of the underlying dynamics of complex systems. A fth thrust, application demonstration, is organized as a cross-cutting e ort to develop the strategy for general applicability and validation of the research outcomes, and to conduct proof-of-concept demonstrations on applications from DOE mission areas, including building energy eciency, reactor power control and science user facility control. The research in this proposal will be conducted by researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Paci c Northwest National Laboratory; the University of California, Santa Barbara; and Arizona State University.

Catalytic Kinetics and Mechanisms in Phosphorus Recycling from Ribonucleotide Structures by Iron Oxide Minerals,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021172,"Aristilde, Ludmilla",Ludmilla.Aristilde@northwesternuniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","The proposed research will combine experimental and molecular modeling approaches to address a fundamental research need relevant to Geosciences Research—Geochemistry. Specifically, we seek to address the lack of kinetic characterization and mechanistic elucidation of the abiotic turnover of organic phosphorus into inorganic phosphorus catalyzed at iron (Fe) (oxyhydr)oxide mineral interfaces. A long-standing knowledge gap in the geochemical cycling of phosphorus is a fundamental understanding of the abiotic turnover of organic phosphorus into inorganic phosphorus through catalytic reactions with reactive minerals. Field-scale data implicate iron (oxyhydr)oxide minerals in influencing phosphorus trapping, fate, and bioavailability by exhibiting strong adsorption of inorganic phosphate and organophosphate compounds. These iron-bearing minerals are ubiquitously present and amongst the most reactive minerals in soils and sediments. Beyond adsorption, another critical role of these minerals is the catalytic hydrolysis of plant- and microbe-derived biomolecules to release inorganic phosphate. Significant amongst these biomolecules are ribonucleotides, which are important components of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and energy currencies (ATP, NADH, NADPH) in all living cells from plants, algae, and microorganisms. Ribonucleotides thus constitute widespread and abundant organic phosphorus forms in geological matrices in the biosphere. Here the research goal is to obtain a molecular-scale understanding of the kinetic and mechanistic controls in the catalytic recycling of phosphorus from ribonucleotide structures reacted with iron (oxyhydr)oxide minerals of different types (ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite). This fundamental understanding is required to evaluate and predict the role of these minerals as an important contributor to the sourcing versus the trapping of recycled phosphorus. The three research objectives are to (1) determine the kinetics and speciation of ribonucleotide transformation reacted with the different minerals, (2) elucidate the mechanisms of interactions of ribonucleotides and their transformation by-products at the mineral interfaces, and (3) decipher the molecular-scale reaction pathway mechanisms underlying the mineral catalytic reactivity towards the ribonucleotide structures. Our central hypothesis is that the reactivity of specific ribonucleotide adsorbate conformations on iron oxy(hydr)oxides minerals will dictate the recycling versus trapping of recycled phosphorus. Leveraging advancements in analytical techniques to probe speciation of organic by-products along with appropriate combination of experimental data with molecular simulations is necessary to capture the heterogeneity and complexity of coupled adsorption and transformation reactions of ribonucleotides on the minerals. The proposed research seeks to capture these processes by employing a novel combination of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches as adopted from the field of molecular biology, lab-based infrared spectroscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray techniques, and both force field-based and quantum-level molecular simulations. The research outcomes are aimed at achieving significant advancements the field of geochemistry and beyond. The first research outcome is to establish new conceptual framework for determining the kinetic parameters to describe the catalytic reactivity of the minerals towards ribonucleotide structures. The second research outcome is to elucidate the ribonucleotide-mineral interfacial interactions that serve as precursors to the prescribed selective reactivity of the minerals. The third research outcome is to unveil the mechanisms of the catalytic reactions by constructing molecular-level depictions of the reaction pathways. Potential impacts of these outcomes are accurate accounting of organic phosphorus as an abiotic sourcing of inorganic phosphorus found at mineral interfaces, accurate evaluation of the critical associations between the phosphorus and carbon cycles, and new catalytic means of P recycling to innovate nutrient recovery, all of which are important to the Department of Energy."

Fundamental to these scientific and technological applications are the complex electronic structures and photophysical properties of heavy-element complexes that can induce unique chemical reactivity and optical/magnetic responses. Quantum theories for heavy-element research represent a frontier challenge in electronic structure method development, and, at the same time, offer the greatest opportunities to probe the unique chemistry of the heavy-element complexes whose properties cannot be defined by periodic table trends. We aim to produce a hierarchical set of computational methods that are designed to accurately predict heavy-element properties. The new computational methods include highly accurate relativistic effects while maintaining a balanced description of all types of electron-electron interactions. This ""Gold Standard"" of relativistic quantum theory addresses the pressing need to connect physical insight to the molecular properties and spectroscopic signals of heavy-element compounds. The research activities are grounded using a synergistic approach encompassing innovations in theory and computational applications/validations bolstered by high-performance software. This research produces new computational tools that bring about an immediate impact to the Heavy-Element Chemistry community and a long-lasting impact beyond the literal scope of the research program.

Balandin University of California – Riverside This project aims at understanding physical mechanisms and developing methods for electric-bias control of phase transitions in quasi-two-dimensional (2D) charge-density-wave (CDW) quantum materials. Strongly correlated CDW phase is a macroscopic quantum state consisting of a periodic modulation of the electronic charge density accompanied by a periodic distortion of the atomic lattice in a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) or quasi-2D layered metallic crystals. The investigation will focus on atomically thin films of certain transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) such as 1T polytype of TaS2 and TaSe2. The specific objectives of the project include (i) development of innovative approaches for investigation and controlling CDW phases in 2D TMDs with external stimuli; (ii) understanding the physical mechanisms behind the CDW phase transitions in quasi-2D van der Waals materials; (iii) investigating “hidden phases” at temperatures below the transition to commensurate CDW phase; (iv) separating the pure electric field CDW phase switching from Joule heating induced switching; and (v) understanding the physics of immunity of CDWs in quasi-2D materials to irradiation damage. The 2D CDW materials have recently attracted a lot of attention owing to a wealth of demonstrated intriguing physical phenomena, existence of multiple phase transitions above room temperature (RT) and strong dependence of material properties on the thickness of quasi-2D films and on external stimuli. The physics of CDW phases in quasi-2D materials of TMD group is substantially different from, and much less understood than their bulk counterparts with quasi-1D crystal structure. In addition to the above RT phase transitions, 1T-TaS2 reveals such intriguing properties as multiple step-like resistance changes and hysteresis, and surprising radiation hardness. There have been reports of possible “hidden” phases at low temperature, but their physical origin is still a subject of intense debates. The reports on de-pinning and sliding of CDWs in 2D material systems are scarce. The role of electric field and local heating on inducing the transitions in 2D CDW is not clear. The use of innovative characterization techniques such as low-frequency noise spectroscopy, a combination of Brillouin and Raman light scattering spectroscopy, nanoscale thermometry, ultra-fast current pulses, electric and magnetic stimuli, as well as a range of original experiments will allow us to investigate and understand these exciting phenomena. The thin films of 2D CDW materials will be produced by exfoliation from chemically synthesized crystals and placed on desired substrates using in-house built transfer systems. (i) The project will undertake an unconventional approach for distinguishing the pure electrical-field-driven phase changes from those resulting from local Joule heating by using the thermally conductive substrates, local thermometry, and ultra-fast current pulses. (ii) The low-frequency noise measurements will be converted into a powerful “noise spectroscopy” technique for investigation of phase transitions and CDW sliding in 2D van der Waals materials by combining it with controlled introduction of defects. (iii) The project will use a combination of the Brillouin – Mandelstam and Raman spectroscopy for in situ observation of CDWs transitions in 2D materials under external electric and magnetic field stimuli. (iv) The evolution of properties of 2D CDW materials will be studied under electron, X-ray irradiation using an innovative combination of inelastic spectroscopy and electron transport measurements. The physics insights gained on 2D van der Waals quantum materials’ properties will enable transformative changes in materials for electronics, potentially leading to new – DOE mission relevant – technologies for operation in high-radiation environments, monitoring nuclear materials, particle accelerators as well as in medical diagnostics and radiation treatments. The pure-field induced CDW switching above RT can potentially be used in low-energy-dissipation information processing. The strongly correlated 2D CDW materials are promising for developing quantum sensors, an essential component of future quantum communication and computing technologies."

They hold great potential in nuclear power production, fossil fuel power plants, concentrated solar power, geothermal power, and ship propulsion. To unlock the potential of sCO2 power cycles, technology readiness must be demonstrated on the scale of 10 – 600 MWe and at the sCO2 temperatures and pressures of 350 – 700 ºC and 20 – 35 MPa for nuclear industries. The lack of suitable seals at sCO2 operating conditions is one of the main challenges at the component level. So far, conventional seals all suffer from the incapability of handling sCO2 pressure and temperature in one way or another. To this end, we propose a patented elasto-hydrodynamic (EHD) high-pressure, high temperature, and scalable shaft seal for sCO2 cycles. Under the EHD mechanism, the higher the pressures, the tighter the sealing, while still sustaining a continuous sCO2 film. A patented secondary seal will be integrated to the primary seal to provide sealing at startup, which will enable active sealing for the whole operating range (from cold start to operating conditions). To further promote the longevity of the EHD seal, a proprietary wear-resistant coating deposition method will be explored. In Phase I, the simulation strategies have been established to address the complexity of the EHD analysis. Two pending US patents were resulted from the Phase I Project and the Phase I simulations have been published at ASME POWER 2021 and ASME TURBO EXPO 2021. An extensive analysis of the EHD seal has been conducted for nuclear power generation turbomachinery and a test rigs has been designed to test the EHD seal internally. The test rig will be completed by the end of the Phase I (July 2021) for seal demonstration and optimization. The Team has identified potential partners for the EHD seal development, including four federal laboratories. Two energy-saving and emission-reducing applications have been identified for the EHD seal: sCO2 Power Generation Turbomachinery Seal – Operate at sCO2 Conditions and Scalable to18” +. High Efficiency Aircraft Engine Seal – Cut Total Aircraft Fuel Consumption by 3-5%. The Phase II Project will begin with developing a prototype EHD seal and optimize it via in-house testing and application-specific simulations, followed by an EHD seal demonstration at SNL’s 2” sCO2 Seal Testing Facility. The system integration approach and manufacturing process will be investigated and established. A new on-shaft coating deposition system will be studied for coatings on large sCO2 turbomachinery shaft (18”+). A path to commercialization will be identified and presented."

Once in the ocean, litter makes its way into sensitive ecosystems, hurting both animal life and making beaches unsightly. Collecting floating litter in a cost-effective way, however, is challenging to accomplish without impeding other critical river functions. Leveraging hydrokinetic energy and robotics, VPI Technology Group (VPI) has conceived and proved the viability of a unique and widely applicable approach to assess and monitor plastic debris levels in a waterway, and to collect and aggregate the debris, making it ready for extraction. Phase I analyzed the mechanics of the proposed approach, designed a proof-of-concept system, and tested it on the Jordan River (Utah). It also piloted techniques to automatically identify floating trash and/or surface traffic with cameras. Overall, the Phase I work demonstrated the function of the key pieces of the RoboCatch system: the active boom and the river monitoring. In Phase II, VPI will refine the development of the subsystems and combine them into a working system which will be deployed and evaluated on a U.S. river. The unique features of the proposed system allow collection and aggregation of waste from a wide range of waterway sizes, even when those rivers are frequented by heavy boat traffic. These features allow the system to be deployed in waterways running alongside heavy urban developments, including locales that are infamous for waterway pollution."
Coupled Long-Term Experiment and Model Investigation of the Differential Response of Plants and Soil Microbes in a Changing Permafrost Tundra Ecosystem,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020227,"Schuur, Edward",Edward.Schuur@northernarizonauniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","We established a new type of multifactor ecosystem experiment in 2008 at the Eight Mile Lake watershed in the foothills of the Alaska Range that was designed to significantly warm deep soil and degrade permafrost (perennially-frozen) ground. Within this framework, we also manipulate the seasonal water table within the soil profile. For ten years, this manipulation has degraded an increasing amount of permafrost each year, more than doubling the growing-season depth of ground thaw. Warming alone has resulted in wetter soils as a result of ground subsidence, and the drying treatment counteracts that effect by significantly reducing the soil water table. This warming and drying experiment represents a one-of-a-kind system that that influences air and deep soil temperatures, permafrost, and creates wetter and drier soil moisture conditions that are primary drivers of changing tundra ecosystems across the entire Arctic landscape. This unique long-termexperimental framework allows us to study the coupled responses of plant and soil microbial communities to environmental change. The vastly different timescales that shape the aboveground plant community and the belowground soil microbes impacts the trajectory and timing of carbon release and uptake across high latitude regions with critical implications for global climate. Soil microbial communities have the potential to respond relatively quickly to a changing environment, converting thawed organic matter into carbon dioxide and methane. In contrast, the slow growth rates and successional dynamics typical of these long-lived perennial plants means that change in the plant community in response to disturbance and a changing environment can play out over decades to a century, and are unlikely to match short-term responses. The goal of this proposal is to address the following overarching question: How does the response of plants and soil microbes to changing environmental conditions affect permafrost ecosystem carbon balance over decadal timescales? We hypothesize that soil microbial communities will respond rapidly to environmental changes associated with permafrost thaw. This will result in the decomposition of old soil carbon that has been stored in these ecosystems due to cold temperatures. However, the trajectory of thawed permafrost soils into wetter and drier alternate states due to ground subsidence will determine whether soil saturation can continue to protect soil organic matter, as well the proportion of carbon dioxide and methane that is released to the atmosphere. Based on our latest results, we also hypothesize that changes in surface hydrology and thaw increases lateral carbon loss that can bypass the local microbial community, and that this pathway is significant in magnitude relative to direct atmospheric losses. Plant carbon uptake is expected to in part offset soil carbon losses, but this dynamic will change on a longer timescales (decades) as compared to the timescale of change for the microbial community. The plant response will be more limited than that of microbes especially where soils are dry. The slower successional dynamics of the plant community will cause greater time lags in potential long-term ecosystem carbon gain (after the initial ecosystem response phase), and also will be affected by the hydrologic change that exports nutrients and leads to the drier and wetter alternate states. Quantifying the response of plants and soil organisms that control overall ecosystem carbonbalance requires a coupled experiment and model research approach in order to understand the global-scale implications of changes in these sentinel ecosystems. This proposal will conduct a final suite of measurements focused on new hypotheses that will complete the intensive phase of this experiment. Additionally, past work has identified critical shortfalls of model projections of the permafrost carbon feedback to climate. As one solution, mechanistic understanding from this experiment will be incorporated into an Ecological Platform for Assimilating Data framework that interactively couples measurements and modeling. The data assimilation technique will help address key structural and parameterization shortcomings of some widely-used models. Model analysis will not only provide future simulations, but will also evaluate the core experimental datasets (plants, soil, ecosystem) to determine the optimal measurement scheme for this experiment such that, after completion of this final intensive phase, long-term manipulation at lower measurement intensity could be maintained if the science continued to call for this long-term experimental perspective in the future."

The overarching objective is to develop and apply &lsquo;omics approaches to investigate microbial community processes involved in nutrient cycling. The specific objectives of the proposed work are 1) to evaluate the microbial ecology of nutrient uptake, testing hypotheses about nutrient assimilation in response to temperature variation; 2) to evaluate the ecology of nutrient-use efficiency for soil microorganisms within a framework of ecological theory, and 3) to develop new isotope-enabled genomics and transcriptomics techniques that probe the microbial ecology of nutrient dissimilation. This work will push the frontier of isotope-enabled genomics by connecting quantitative stable-isotope probing to ecological theory about nutrient assimilation, nutrient-use efficiency, metabolic efficiency, and by applying these tools to understand the basic biology and ecology of soil microorganisms and how they transform nutrients in the environment. Description - This work will develop and apply new methods to understand the ecology of soil microorganisms using stable isotope tracers and genomics, which when combined offer powerful insights into the cycling of nutrients in the environment and the organisms that take up, use, and recycle those nutrients as they grow and die. This project will focus on particular soil microorganisms, bacteria and fungi, that make up the majority of life in soil, and which are responsible for most of the nutrient transformations in soil that are vital to ecosystems, and to people. This project will also evaluate how soil microorganisms and the nutrient cycling processes they catalyze are sensitive to shifts in temperature, a major driver of biological processes. This new suite of techniques will investigate and describe the microbial ecology of nutrient cycling in soil environments. The work relies on four long-term field experiments where temperature-treated and control plots occur in arctic, boreal, temperate, and tropical biomes. The systems biology approach will interrogate community and taxon-specific microbial controls over key biogeochemical processes in terrestrial environments, and test quantitative ecological and biogeochemical principles using genomics and isotope data, including theories of element limitation, growth efficiency, and nutrient use efficiency. The proposed work will therefore &ldquo;form and test hypotheses on underlying ecological principles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;facilitate scaling of concepts and data across multiple levels of biological organization,&rdquo; quotations from the request for proposals that indicate the strong alignment of the proposed work with scientific priorities identified by the research community. The proposed work will occur in laboratory and field experiments, including a number of DOE-supported climate change experiments: the Merriam-Powell Climate Change Experiment (temperate), the Toolik Lake warming experiment (Arctic), the TRACE warming experiment at Luquillo LTER (tropical), and the SPRUCE experiment (boreal). Potential Impact - Microorganisms are the engines of nature&rsquo;s nutrient cycles, responsible for making nutrients available to plants, for creating soil organic matter which supports natural systems, and for influencing the composition and radiative properties of the atmosphere. Yet, there is virtually no quantitative understanding of how microbial rates of nutrient transformation are distributed among the tens of thousands of microorganisms in soil. This work has the potential to advance the field by providing a means to ascribe element fluxes with taxonomic resolution, and to provide the first tests of the sensitivities of these processes to temperature."
Characterizing the Variation and Covariation of Cloud Microphysical Properties and Implications for Simulation of Subgrid-scale Warm-Rain Processes in Earth System Models,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020057,"Zhang, Zhibo",Zhibo.Zhang@universityofmarylandbaltimorecounty,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Low-level liquid-phase clouds located in the marine boundary layer constitute an important component in the global climate system. The water budget, radiative effects, and lifetime of these clouds are all influenced by the precipitations (so-called warm rain) in these clouds. Unfortunately, because of the relatively coarse effective grid resolution of the current generation of climate models, the variety of cloud microphysical processes occurring inside a climate model grid cell are often oversimplified or unconstrained by observations. We propose a combined observational and modeling study to explore the impacts of subgrid-scale variability on the representation of warm, low-cloud processes relevant for climate models. The proposed work emphasizes developing innovative, process-level scientific insights to better understand the factors controlling the formation of precipitation formation in warm boundary-layer clouds. The research also directly aligns with the objectives of Atmospheric System Research of seeking methods to improve cloud parameterizations in climate models. In climate models, the initialization of warm rain is usually parameterized as nonlinear functions of grid-mean cloud properties. Because of the nonlinear nature of these functions, neglecting variability within the climate model grid volume can lead to substantial biases in precipitation production, cloud cover, and surface radiative fluxes. In state-of-the art climate models, the influence of subgrid-scale variability is represented as an enhancement factor coefficient to the autoconversion and accretion rates calculated from the model variables. However, enhancement factor is typically taken to be a constant or even used as a knob to tune model cloud properties to match observations, an ad hoc approach that may yield a desired cloud outcome yet introduce compensating errors. In this proposal we argue for a systematic evaluation of this factor. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to characterize and understand subgrid-scale variations and co-variations of cloud microphysical properties and use the results to evaluate and improve the representation of subgrid warm-rain processes in climate models. Our proposal has two coordinated research thrusts in order to accomplish this goal: 1. Characterizing the subgrid-scale variations and co-variations of cloud and precipitation microphysical properties, and exploring their dependence on environmental factors, horizontal scale and in-cloud height. 2. Evaluating the uncertainty associated with the treatments of microphysical enhancement factors for warm-rain processes in the context of current-generation climate models and developing pathways to improve how climate models represent the influence of subgrid-scale variability on microphysical processes. To accomplish these research efforts, we propose a combined observational and modeling study based on in-situ observations collected during the recent Aerosol and Cloud Experiments in the Eastern North Atlantic field campaign, routine surface-based observations on Graciosa Island, and a start-of-the-art large-eddy simulation model. Expected outcomes of the research are 1. a thorough and physically-based determination of the variability of cloud properties and the processes that govern that variability; 2. an evaluation of the uncertainties in the current warm-rain processes in climate models; and 3. vital improvements to the representation of low-cloud variability that can be directly implemented in the newly developed Energy Exascale Earth System Model."

Existing quantum information systems, including qubits based on spins in diamond and superconducting quantum circuits have each distinguished themselves for specific excellent properties. For example, solid-state spin quantum bits (qubits) in diamond have long quantum-coherent lifetimes and the ability to be optically measured that enables a connection to quantum networks. One drawback is that they lack a good method for scaling to many connected spins. Likewise, superconducting quantum circuits are designed quantum information systems that are scalable, but they lack a long-lived quantum memory element. Currently there is no effective method to connect superconducting circuits to individual spin qubits. These deficiencies can be addressed by forming “hybrid” quantum systems in which different quantum elements work together to add their functionality. The research team is studying the physics and materials science to lay the foundation of a new approach – using quantum coherent magnons as a new resource to couple and enhances existing quantum elements. The resulting hybrid “quantum magnonic” system will create new opportunities for enhanced quantum functionality including the creation and control of large-scale quantum states normally studied in an ultra-cold atomic gas, new interconnects for solid-state quantum bits (qubits), and the ability to control the direction of quantum information flow (non-reciprocity). These improvements will enable advances in applications ranging from quantum-enhanced sensing to quantum networking. A critical challenge in this effort will be to integrate highly coherent magnetic materials with existing quantum systems without ruining the excellent properties of each component quantum state. The project will use vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE]x~2) to form the magnetic material hosting quantum magnonic excitations. V[TCNE]x~2 is an organic-based magnet that exhibits extremely low magnetic damping even at cryogenic temperatures where many quantum technologies operate. Unlike the more conventional crystalline materials, this material can be grown on any substrate, which is ideal for integration with sophisticated quantum devices. The key goals of this research are to understand how to create and control hybrid magnonic quantum systems that operate at cryogenic temperatures, extend their quantum coherence lifetimes, and form quantum-coherent interactions with the environment. The research team will study the inherent properties of a magnetic quantum system, and the ability to control the direction of quantum information flow, to enable next-generation quantum technologies."

Such forces are believed to be responsible for the near absence of antimatter in the observable Universe. These rare isotopes, some for the first time, will be produced in large numbers at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams currently under construction at Michigan State University providing an unprecedented opportunity to probe for new physics. In anticipation, we will use abundant isotopes to develop new techniques to manipulate nuclei embedded inside an optically transparent solid at cryogenic temperatures. Implantation into a solid, such as neon and argon, is potentially an effective way to both efficiently capture and repeatedly probe the small number of rare nuclei, such as radium and protactinium. An optically transparent host medium at cryogenic temperatures would allow for the laser manipulation of the nuclei in a thermally quiet and stable environment for a wide variety of guest species such as polar molecules. In such systems, the nuclei are exposed to extraordinarily large electric fields and magnetic field gradients, which significantly amplifies the measurability of certain time-reversal violating effects. The potential sensitivity of this new approach could be at least a few hundred times greater than the current leading experiment which uses mercury atoms."

This interdisciplinary project will address these limitations by establishing the ""clostridia Foundry for Biosystems Design (cBioFAB)"". Working both in vitro (cell-free) and in vivo, the goal of the cBioFAB is to combine advanced genome editing, genome-wide measurements, computational modeling, and cell-free technologies to expand the set of platform organisms that meet DOE's bioenergy goals. The key focus is to enable high-level synthesis of next-generation biofuels and bioproducts from plant biomass-derived gases. The project will use a large collection of clostridia species, which are an understudied but valuable group of microbes. This research will accelerate the production of new gas fermentation products derived from lignocellulosic biomass, while advancing toward the Genomic Sciences Program's goal of understanding the fundamental rules that drive microbial systems to develop novel approaches for biological design."

Schadler, University of Vermont (Principle Investigator) Sanat K. Kumar, Columbia University (Co-Investigator) Brian C. Benicewicz, University of South Carolina (Co-Investigator) Composites consisting of spherical nanoparticles and a polymer matrix have shown considerable promise for improving the mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of polymers. One of the critical factors in achieving the properties is controlling how the nanoparticles are organized in the polymer matrix. Most prior work has focused on organizing nanoparticles in amorphous polymers, but 70% of all polymers sold annually are semicrystalline. Inspired by this apparent disconnect, our work in the current DOE funded grant and this renewal proposal employs a novel handle, polymer crystallization, to organize NPs in semicrystalline polymers. We have found that by changing the rate of crystallization, we can control whether the nanoparticles are well dispersed, or are pushed in between the crystalline regions to form sheets of particles in the amorphous regions. We hypothesize that the isothermal crystallization rate and the nanoparticle diffusivity, are the two relevant control parameters in this context. We have established the broad applicability of this approach in two polymers, polyethylene (PE) and polyethyleneoxide (PEO). To achieve this goal we developed a method for attaching (grafting) long PE chains from NPs with controlled graft density and molecular weight, giving us the ability to tailor their dispersion in the PE melt prior to crystallization. In this renewal proposal, we will develop the fundamental, quantitative understanding that will allow us to independently tailor polymer crystallization rate, NP diffusivity and NP agglomeration state in semicrystalline polymers so as to facilely control NP ordering and hence properties. More specifically we will focus on three areas: Quantifying the relationship between particle diffusivity (by altering the grafted chain density and molecular weight, and by using a bimodal population of brushes on the NP) and the critical crystallization rate. Manipulating crystallization rates by controlling graft chemistry: We have found that the stereoregularity of the grafted chains is critical in controlling the crystallization rate. Apparently, crystalline grafts can co-crystallize with the matrix and speed crystallization kinetics; amorphous grafts on the other hand hinder crystallization. In addition, by organizing the fillers in the melt, we have shown we can alter the nucleation and crystallization rate when the sample is cooled below its melting point. Understanding the fundamentals of both these phenomena is critical to controlling NP organization and therefore properties. Zone Annealing: Manufacturing protocols require that polymers are extruded and then directionally crystallized in the presence of flow (and temperature) gradients. To mimic these practically more relevant synthesis protocols, we have designed a flow setup, modeled on the zone annealing (ZA) method to directionally solidify polymer nanocomposites. As expected, this protocol yields spherulites that are elongated in the flow direction. We will develop an understanding of how flow induced orientation impacts the crystallinity (initial results suggest it is higher) as well as use it as a method to create larger scale alignment of the lamella (and thus the filler sheets)."
MACHINE LEARNING FOR BEAM QUALITY AND CONTRAST CONTROL OF HIGH REP RATE LASER ACCELERATORS,Office of High Energy Physics,DE-SC0016804,"Krushelnick, Karl",Karl.Krushelnick@regentsoftheuniversityofmichigan,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Machine learning for beam quality and contrast control of high rep rate laser accelerators Karl Krushelnick, University of Michigan, Professor and Principal Investigator Alec Thomas, Professor, University of Michigan, Co-Investigator The use of high intensity ultra-short laser pulses as drivers for the next generation of accelerators has received considerable attention over the past decade and demonstrations of multi-GeV electron acceleration, 100 MeV ions and energetic positron beams have been performed. Beam quality and control is approaching that needed for applications such as x-ray and neutron production. However the main disadvantage of laser sources is the relatively low repetition rate and stability of the laser drivers. For example, applications for a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) would be dramatically enhanced if the laser driver repetition rate could be increased to 10 kHz. In a LWFA, the laser pulse drives the plasma wave via the ponderomotive force, which depends on laser intensity, shape and spectral content. In general, all of these parameters are constantly evolving throughout the acceleration process. Although it is possible to obtain simple expressions for the dependence of LWFA output on plasma density and laser intensity for an unchanging laser pulse, in reality, the evolution of laser parameters makes analytical treatment less tractable. Furthermore, there are a large number of input parameters that must be tuned to optimize the accelerator performance. The usual approach to optimization is to perform a series of single variable scans in the neighborhood of the expected optimal settings. These scans are challenging, as the input parameters are often coupled and the highly sensitive response of the system can lead to large shot-to-shot variations in output. Moreover, due to the non-linear evolution of the LWFA, altering one input can affect the optimal values of all the other input parameters. Hence, sequential 1D optimizations are highly unlikely to reach the true optimum. A full N-D scan would be prohibitively time consuming for N > 2 and so more intelligent search procedures are required. Machine learning techniques are ideal for this kind of problem. We have used genetic algorithms Bayesian optimization and other methods; using the spatial phase of the laser to optimize a keV electron source, and subsequently using both spectral and spatial phase to optimize multi-MeV sources. In these cases, only some of the laser parameters were controlled preventing full optimization of the LWFA which relies on the complex interplay between the laser and the plasma. Further, these optimizations did not incorporate experimental errors and fluctuations and were therefore prone to distortion by statistical outliers. In this project, we will demonstrate fully automated laser pulse optimization at very high power in addition to control of laser pointing which adds a random fluctuating component to the laser pulse. In performing such optimizations, the algorithms will build a surrogate model of the parameter space, including the uncertainty arising from the sparsity of the data, fluctuations and measurement variances. Consequently we will develop feedback control of high power high rep rate laser pulses with respect to focal spot shape, temporal pulse shape, frequency chirp and laser pointing. In our work up to now we have demonstrated that the performance of LWFA can be dramatically improved – using deformable mirrors as well as control of the laser pulse shape through the applied phase (Dazzler). In this project we will leverage our recent acquisition (through the establishment of the ZEUS laser facility at UM) of a 300 TW 5 Hz amplifier in 2022. This will enable the use of feedback techniques of the pulses needed for stable production of multi-GeV energy electron beams. In our proposed project we will extend machine learning techniques along with active stabilization techniques to 300 TW to produce controlled fluxes of electrons and x-rays. We will work not only to utilize adaptive optics, with genetic algorithms at high rep rate, but also combine this feedback with the Dazzler and pointing stabilization to optimize all aspects of the laser focal spot for improving electron beam energy and stability. While the optimization at 5 Hz works more “slowly” than that at kHz rep rates we will be able to demonstrate the viability of the technology at these higher powers. Another critical aspect for high rep rate laser driven accelerators is control of the “laser contrast” at relativistic intensities which has never been previously done. A technique to achieve this contrast is the use of plasma mirrors. We will continue work using a micron thick flowing water “window” formed by collision of water jets, which can be used at the required kHz or higher repetition rates."

The target hydrocarbons include both small molecules such as propane (which undergoes loss of hydrogen) and ethylene (which undergoes coupling to larger molecules like butenes), as well as much larger hydrocarbon molecules that behave like polymers. The study will develop predictive structure-activity relations for the catalytic metals using synthesis approaches that create highly uniform metal structures. Where the structures involve pairs of atoms (for example, chromium and titanium), the project will explore the structural relationship between them and the impact on their reactivity, which may be different from the isolated metal atoms. The structures will be studied while the reactions are underway, in order to observe the active forms of the metal. Such studies require a combination of observation using advanced spectroscopies and theoretical simulations to interpret the observations.

The largest fraction of such waste consists of polyethylene and polypropylene, which have remarkable kinetic and thermodynamic stability. As a result, common strategies for chemical conversion of polyolefins are based on high-temperature processes, such as pyrolysis. These typically used approaches are not compatible with the principles of delocalized chemical processing and sustainable chemical manufacturing. Electrochemistry offers a sustainable approach if electricity from solar/wind resources is used to drive the conversion of polymers. The general objective of this project is to understand the fundamental chemistry of low-temperature functionalization and depolymerization of polyolefins. The research methodology is organized in three main objectives: (1) Determine the role that the nature of the electrode plays on the depolymerization mechanisms of polyolefins; (2) Establish the role that active ions in solution play in the depolymerization mechanism of polyolefins; and (3) Design of electrocatalysts and electrolytes in concert with operating potential to enable depolymerization and functionalization of polyolefins regardless of heteroatoms and additives. The results obtained from the proposed work will provide fundamental knowledge at the atomic level of mechanisms involved in the electrochemical functionalization of polymers, enabling the development of strategies for rational design of sustainable processes for plastics upcycling that will further aid in reaching a circular economy and resolving plastics waste management."

Improving the performance of oxygenic photosynthesis also holds promise for meeting the demand sustainable food sources for the expanding human population, whereas engineering photosynthesis in tractable bacteria could provide an interesting approach for production of biofuels or of a range of compounds with reduced energy needs. Such work relies on the biosynthesis of chlorophyll in photosynthetic organisms. Chlorophyll is synthesized via the same pathway that also synthesizes heme, and the enzyme magnesium chelatase carries out the committed step that directs a precursor molecule into the chlorophyll pathway rather than the heme pathway. Some photosynthetic organisms also convert heme into bilins (linear tetrapyrroles) for light harvesting to enhance photosynthetic efficiency or to tune their response to specific light environments. We have recently discovered that bilins stimulate magnesium chelatase in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by binding to GUN4, a protein that itself binds magnesium chelatase. The presence of bilin and GUN4 also stabilizes the H-subunit of magnesium chelatase (CHLH). This project examines the role of bilin in chlorophyll biosynthesis by asking three questions. First, we want to understand how GUN4 and bilins stimulate magnesium chelatase and stabilize CHLH. We will use computational, biochemical and spectroscopic techniques to monitor the loss of CHLH integrity and to measure and manipulate the GUN4•CHLH interaction. Next, we want to know whether bilins generally regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis in other photosynthetic organisms. We will reconstitute bilin biosynthesis from different algae in a model bacterium to learn what bilins these algae make and to test binding of those bilins to GUN4 proteins from the same algae. Lastly, we want to understand how this regulation came about by examining how photosynthetic organisms acquired bilin biosynthesis and by examining CHLH from an unusual photosynthetic bacterium that lacks GUN4. We have identified possible ancestors for bilin biosynthesis enzymes in non-photosynthetic bacteria. We will use biochemical, spectroscopic, and computational approaches to examine the properties and requirements of some of these proteins. Work under this project will shed light on the origins and requirements of self-assembling, self-regulating oxygenic photosynthesis. It will help us understand the mechanisms living cells use to make enough chlorophyll for photosynthesis and will help us improve those mechanisms or replicate them as we seek to meet our own need for sustainable energy and food."

The reactivity and selectivity of a transition metal catalyst is intimately related to the ligand-sphere geometry and, in many cases, the ideal ligand geometry for one step of a catalytic cycle is poorly matched to the ideal ligand geometry for another, resulting in sub-optimal efficiency. Macroscopic mechanical forces are both large, potentially much larger than interatomic forces, and are directional and localized to an extent that differentiates them from other forms of energy input such as heat or light. Mechanical force represents a heretofore untapped approach to modulate catalyst geometry, with the potential to reversibly modulate catalyst geometry on the timescale of catalytic turnover or monomer enchainment. This project will address the fundamental challenges associated with the development of a new class of mechanically responsive catalysts (mechanocatalysts) in which active transition metal catalysts are strategically embedded in flexible polymer networks such that application of external mechanical force (stretching or deformation of the polymer network) leads to modulation of catalyst geometry, and hence reactivity and selectivity. Research activities include the elucidation of force-reactivity relationships of elementary transformations and catalytic reactions in homogeneous systems, the synthesis of catalytically active elastomer networks, the modulation of the flexible catalysts embedded within these networks with force, and the quantification of these force-activity relationships. The development of novel catalyst/polymer hybrid materials, the elucidation of force-activity relationships, and the potential applications of mechanocatalysts to the production of value-added chemicals and polymers from hydrocarbon feedstocks are relevant to the mission of the DOE Catalysis Science Program."

Beratan, Duke University (Principal Investigator) Electron bifurcation (EB) reactions are reversible and energy efficient redox processes used in Nature to provide the reducing equivalents for chemical reactions, including nitrogen fixation, carbon dioxide reduction, and dihydrogen production. EB uses a two-electron donor to reduce cofactors on two spatially separated redox chains at very different potentials. Remarkably, electron bifurcating enzymes evolved novel schemes to avoid electron short-circuiting between the two redox pathways. The aim of this study is to leverage our recent theoretical discoveries regarding bifurcation reaction mechanisms to establish a comprehensive understanding of EBkinetics. Our intended outcome is to use kinetic network modeling to understand the electron refilling of the two-electron bifurcating donor, to create a flexible computational framework to interrogate natural bifurcating systems of varied structure, and to begin to assemble blueprints from this modeling to enable the design of synthetic bioinspired EB structures. Our recent studies found an apparently universal strategy that is used by bifurcating enzymes to prevent energy wasting short-circuiting reactions. The scheme engineers the free energy landscapes in Nature of the high- and low-potential redox chains that are linked to the bifurcating two-electron donor in a steep pattern. The proposed studies will explore the detailed implications of this discovery for both the function of biological bifurcating enzymes and for the design of synthetic bioinspired bifurcating systems. This proposal has three specific aims. First, we will explore electron refilling of the bifurcating donor, sometimes by a freely diffusing small molecule two-electron donor species. This reaction is essential for bifurcating enzymes and is very poorly understood. The characteristics of this reaction are crucial, as the refilling step can turn on energy wasting short-circuiting reactions, and this possibility has not been widely appreciated or explored. Once robust mechanisms to recharge the EB systems are elaborated, we anticipate that the basic mechanistic logic of EB will largely be in place, enabling more detailed theoretical analysis of bifurcating enzymes using the tools of modern computational chemistry. As well, establishing this conclusive mechanistic framework should allow the launching of productive campaigns to design and realize synthetic bioinspired EB catalysts. Second, we will build comprehensive models for EB and apply these models to emerging experimental studies of bifurcating enzymes. This research objective requires the establishment of advanced kinetics simulation tools to model the flux of electrons through bifurcating enzymes that have many accessible redox states. Analysis tools will be developed to assess how electron bifurcating performance varies with the number of and energies of cofactors as we deviate from the idealized free energy landscapes that we have explored in our preliminary analysis. Using a Gillespie approach to the electron transfer (ET) kinetics will enable efficient and scalable simulation of EB, incorporating redox cofactor occupancy dependent kinetics, proton coupled ET steps, and second-order binding and ET events, for example, moving far beyond the capabilities of our current approaches. Third, we will take first steps toward the ambitious long-term goal of enabling the bioinspired design of synthetic EB systems. The lessons learned using the kinetic models established in this study promise to assist in the design of future synthetic bifurcating machinery. We will initiate feasibility studies toward realizing EB on arrays of quantum dots, DNA origami motifs, or synthetic organic frameworks."
Signal Transduction Pathways of Chloroplast Quality Control,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019573,"Woodson, Jesse","Jesse.Woodson@arizonaboardofregents,theuniversityofarizona","['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","The goal of this project is to understand the signaling mechanisms behind chloroplast quality control pathways that initiate chloroplast repair or degradation in response to photo-oxidative stress. We hypothesize reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced naturally during photosynthesis have the ability to trigger these pathways, allowing individual chloroplasts the ability to control their own fate under dynamic conditions. Such signaling may allow cells to maintain healthy populations of chloroplasts performing efficient photosynthesis. While chloroplast disassembly is a process that occurs naturally in a wide range of plant species, the mechanisms regulating and controlling these processes are not well understood. To identify and characterize genes and proteins in chloroplast quality control pathways, we have used the plastid ferrochelatase two (fc2) mutant of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this mutant, accumulation of the ROS singlet oxygen (1O2) in chloroplasts can be induced non-invasively by growing plants in diurnal light cycles, triggering chloroplast degradation and eventually cell death. A forward genetics screen identified suppressors of chloroplast degradation in fc2 mutants demonstrating this degradation is a genetically controlled response to chloroplast 1O2. Two key processes important for initiating and propagating the signal were also identified through this screen. First, we demonstrated chloroplast gene expression is necessary to initiate signaling, suggesting a product of the chloroplast genome is a signaling factor. Second, a suppressor mutation affecting a cytoplasmic E3 ubiquitin ligase has demonstrated the ubiquitination of chloroplast proteins is an important step in allowing the cell to identify damaged chloroplasts. Therefore, we hypothesize chloroplast-encoded factors allow 1O2 to “mark” specific chloroplasts for repair or degradation by ubiquitinating chloroplast proteins. Such a signaling system may allow individual chloroplasts to control their own maintenance in stressful and dynamic environments. Here we propose to test and expand on these models of chloroplast quality control. The proposed studies will integrate genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches in Arabidopsis in an effort to: (1)Understand the mechanism(s) by which 1O2 triggers chloroplast degradation; (2)Explore the roles of ubiquitination in chloroplast quality control; (3) Determine the role of chloroplast quality control under natural light stress. Completion of the proposed projects should provide an increased understanding of the proteomic and physiological changes in damaged chloroplasts, how these changes are turned into signals, and how these signals are propagated. By studying how these processes work in nature and in the cell, we can gain fundamental knowledge that will allow us to manipulate and maximize energy capture in crops or in designing synthetic photosynthesis machines that can cope with light damage. Such technologies will be crucial to our quest for an abundant food supply as well as cheap and dependable sources of energy."

Quartz cement textures and associated fluid inclusions and thermal histories provide data that can be used to infer the duration and rates at which fractures open. We are developing and testing a structural diagenetic model that accounts for how fracture porosity and rock properties change as a function of thermal exposure and how fracture patterns evolve. We also are documenting the opening histories of entire fractures and fracture arrays in contrasting tectonic and thermal regimes and developing and testing a fully coupled diagenetic-geomechanical model that has the potential to accurately predict fluid flow characteristics of fractured rocks based on coupled effects of diagenesis and deformation. A central theme of our research is the investigation of feedbacks between chemical and mechanical processes in opening-mode fracture growth in subsurface settings. Our cross-disciplinary efforts in fracture and diagenesis research involves characterization, modeling, and laboratory tests. This work builds on the breakthrough of successfully reconstructing the timing and opening rates of parts of single fractures and portions of fracture arrays as a means to document the growth and linkage of fracture arrays. One goal of this research is to understand the effects of variable degrees of fracture cement fill in partitioning progressive deformation between existing fractures and the host rock and how this process affects fracture spatial distributions (whether fractures are clustered in space or not). To aid this effort we have developed and published new methods and software for quantifying fracture spatial arrangements. During the report period 1D versions of the software were widely disseminated and we developed and submitted papers on 2D approaches. Determining the rates at which natural fracture systems grow has long been a refractory challenge in geoscience but such information is essential information for improving predictive models. Fluid inclusion assemblages sequenced via cement texture mapping allow us to unravel the rates and patterns of growth of entire fracture systems and the role of coupled structural and geochemical processes in governing this development. We collect fluid-inclusion data keyed to opening increments to constrain fracture event chronology. We reconstruct fracture histories from core and outcrop examples using high resolution Scanning Electron Microscope-Cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) images along entire fractures and across multiple fractures within arrays. The imaging and mapping protocol, in conjunction with fluid-inclusion analysis, is crucial for fracture opening and length growth history reconstructions. This approach takes advantage of an automated SEM-CL imaging system that may be used for large-area (multiple thin section) imaging. Additionally, for high resolution work, a full color SEM-CL field emission scanning electron microscope with imaging resolution of 3 to 5 nm increases the already rich textural evidence to be found in fracture cement deposits that are contemporaneous with fracture opening. We apply CL imaging methods, compositional analysis, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and cement strength experiments to constrain the controls on, and the rates and patterns of, cement precipitation in fractures. This characterization work is conducted in tandem with development of linked geomechanical and diagenetic models that account for cement accumulation patterns within evolving fracture arrays and experiments designed to constrain model parameters. Model developments underway include 3D cement growth in the geomechanical model at all spanning nodes and mechanical partitioning of fractures into host rock. Results suggest that our integrated approach explains fracture attributes that cannot be accounted for when diagenesis or mechanics are treated as separate, isolated processes. Five field and core-based efforts incorporating the methodology described above are underway as parts of three geoscience Ph.D dissertations and two M.S. theses."

Lubin, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (Principal Investigator) A. M. Vogelmann, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Co-Investigator, Unfunded Collaborator) E. P. Luke, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Co-Investigator, Unfunded Collaborator) Recent research on climate system feedbacks in global climate model simulations indicates that cloud phase transitions have greater implications than previously realized. This applies not just to the Arctic but to most extratropical regions, and also in the evaluation of equilibrium climate sensitivity increases in the latest versions of the major global climate models. At the same time, this consideration is particularly important to the Arctic, as much of its current amplified climate warming involves surface and lower-atmosphere transitions from just below to just above the freezing point of water. When a cloud transitions from the mixed-phase to entirely liquid water, one should expect concomitant changes in optical properties that impact shortwave radiation backscattered to space and transmitted to the surface, longwave radiation from the cloud to the surface, and additional potential changes involving cloud amount and lifetime. There has been recent innovative research using satellite imager retrievals of cloud properties, clearly showing the greater importance of phase transitions as compared with single-phase cloud property changes. However, use of in situ data has so far been limited. The recent successful completion of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) and Cold-air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment (COMBLE) ARM Mobile Facility campaigns, combined with the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) facility, now provide advanced sensor data from three contrasting Arctic regions that collectively offer a wide variety of lower troposphere scenarios in which temperatures cross the freezing point and cloud properties change accordingly. Compared with satellite data analysis, in situ ARM Program data have the advantages of thorough vertical profiling in the lower troposphere, and high time resolution in atmospheric thermodynamics and cloud properties as temperatures vary. This project will address a basic question: What happens with real high latitude clouds — in both microphysics and radiation — when lower troposphere temperatures in a given region increase from just below to just above freezing? Existing empirical literature on Arctic mixed-phase clouds is extensive, but most previous efforts comprise either exploratory work on basic cloud properties, climatological assessments, or model applications to individual cloud systems well-studied by advanced sensor suites. In this work we will provide a new approach - we will identify the episodes in the most advanced high latitude ARM data during which lower troposphere temperatures transition from a range encompassing approximately -10°C to -3°C, to the freezing point or just above, in either direction. We will create case studies based on this criterion, typically spanning several days to a few weeks, in which cloud properties will be derived using the most current techniques. There are several ARM value-added products (VAPs) we can compile for initial evaluation of cloud properties. However, we find that the case studies will be more valuable if we perform additional retrievals of cloud effective particle size and optical depth using Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) and shortwave multispectral radiometer data. We also have a new technique using Ka-band zenith radar data that reveals secondary ice production processes, which are significant in the temperature range just below freezing that we are considering in this work. We will perform k-means clustering on meteorological reanalysis data to determine synoptic influences on the cases, and we will characterize the cases in terms of lower troposphere stability (LTS). This comprehensive characterization of each case, combined with ARM measurements of surface radiative fluxes and satellite observations of top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes, will provide a complete picture of the phase transition as it manifests in the climate system. We hypothesize that a transition from slightly supercooled to the freezing point or slightly warmer will have three potential manifestations: (1) larger shortwave flux transmitted to the surface as supplemental ice absorption by the cloud disappears; (2) or conversely, larger optical depths in liquid-only clouds that decrease shortwave and increase longwave flux at the surface; and/or (3) higher level mixed-phase or ice clouds might offset the other two effects.

These processes often rely on scarce precious metals and the rational design of optimal catalytic materials is hampered by the very complex structures of the catalysts themselves. Motivated by these issues there has been a surge of recent interest in catalysts composed of single precious metal atoms supported by oxides, called single atom catalysts (SACs), or by noble metals, called single atom alloys (SAAs). SAAs and SACs each present unique catalytic reactivity, but they are most effective when operated under different environmental conditions – generally, oxidizing for SACs and reducing conditions for SAAs. The central hypothesis explored in this research is that materials existing in the structural phase space between SAAs and SACs will allow distinct chemical reactivity for industrially important reactions, such as higher alcohol synthesis and the preferential oxidation of CO in H2-rich streams. The research will be focused on single Pt-group metal atom active sites on supports ranging in stoichiometry from metallic Cu to CuO. We will utilize a combined surface science and high surface area catalysis approach to understand the atomic-scale structure of active sites, how they evolve under reaction conditions, and thereby discover structure-function relationships. Ensuring a link between the surface science and catalysis studies in terms of the type and local coordination of the active site is key to understanding and ultimately controlling important catalytic processes. Collectively, this research will lead to the discovery of new catalyst formulations and the development of structure-function relationships that are essential for the heterogenous catalysis community in their quest to rationally design next generation atom-efficient catalysts."

While these quantum devices are still too noisy to beat classical supercomputers at tasks like prime number factorization, quantum simulations with neutral atoms are reaching domains in which they are believed to have a useful ""quantum advantage"" over simulations on classical devices. We propose to use a Rydberg quantum simulator to gain critical insights into outstanding problems at the interface of many-body quantum physics and high energy physics. The focus of the proposed work involves quantum simulation of Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT) and quantum scrambling in quantum gravity models. Specifically, we will use the platform of programmable quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms in configurable tweezer arrays to carry out quantum simulations of LGTs in one and two spatial dimensions and to perform first quantum simulation of the quantum many-body analog of a traversable wormhole. Our goal is to use large-scale atom-based quantum systems to experimentally create complex models of various forms, study their quantum dynamics and to use advanced quantum information and hybrid quantum/classical concepts to directly probe the entanglement defining such many-body states. This way we should be able to uncover the nature of quantum effects in regimes that are not computationally accessible on classical computers, and with quantum information tools, such as atom-by-atom access and control. Solving these currently intractable problems is the focus of the proposed work. Finally, we will to use these new insights from gauge-gravity correspondence to devise theoretically and test experimentally novel approaches to robust quantum information encoding and protection."

Johnson, Yale University (Principal Investigator) Kenneth D. Jordan, University of Pittsburgh (Co-Investigator) Anne B. McCoy, University of Washington (Co-Investigator) Our description of chemical and physical processes in the condensed phase and at interfaces involves a hierarchy of theoretical approaches that integrate high-level quantum treatments of chemical rearrangements with more approximate methods to account for the long-range effects of the surrounding medium. We describe a program that integrates theory and experiment to expose molecular-level paradigms that are inferred, but not generally subjected to critical experimental verification in measurements of macroscopic systems. Our goal is to provide experimental benchmarks and observables on precisely controlled molecular assemblies that are sufficiently complex to capture the many-body effects that drive macroscopic behavior, but are small enough to be addressed with accurate theoretical methods. Because water is the most important medium for chemistry in nature, we have focused much of our recent effort on clarifying the molecular-level mechanics that drive the speciation and dynamics of aqueous solutes, with specific focus on the hydrated proton. Our experimental approach exploits the unique properties of temperature-controlled, size-selected clusters, whose properties are measured with custom-built instruments designed specifically for this task. To accomplish the goal of tracing the molecular origins of bulk behavior, it is essential to develop experimental methods that go beyond structural characterization of systems at low temperature, which has heretofore been our primary focus. We are therefore dedicating considerable effort to extend our methods to address the properties of larger and more complex systems at elevated temperatures. These include integration of a commercial high-resolution mass spectrometer and the demonstration of a way to monitor chemical reactions and structural rearrangements as a function of time under ambient conditions in a closed, finite system. This effectively creates microscopic “test tubes” in which chemical reactions and structural rearrangements can be followed in a regime that unveils the roles-great and small-of all the atoms in the assembly. Importantly, these methods are generally applicable, and we propose to pursue a practical application of our capabilities in which we elucidate the local, molecular-level interactions that underlie the macroscopic behavior of room temperature ionic liquids (ILs). The IL effort is currently being carried out in close collaboration with the Wishart group at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and is motivated by the increasingly important role ILs are playing as media that can be tailored for specific applications, ranging from green solvents to catalysis to satellite thrusters. With these experimental tools now available in the Johnson Lab at Yale, we are poised to usher in a new era where chemical and physical processes under thermal control can be studied in systems that are sufficiently small to enable accurate theoretical modeling, but still large enough to capture the behaviors of processes at interfaces and in the bulk. As such, we aim to provide stringent tests of the efficacy of theoretical models currently employed to simulate bulk phenomena. We recognize that complementary theoretical expertise will be required to accurately treat strongly anharmonic spectra and the thermal behavior of large systems. To meet this challenge, we have expanded the theory team (Kenneth Jordan, U. Pittsburgh) by adding Anne McCoy (U. Washington) in recognition of her unique ability to extract physical insight from the complex spectra often displayed by ionic clusters."

M. Suess, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Principal Investigator) Iron–sulfur clusters (Fe–S) are ubiquitous inorganic cofactors involved in biological energy transduction, where they serve as prototypical electron/hole carriers, as key intermediaries in long-range electron transfer and in mechanisms of electron bifurcation, and as the active sites of substrate binding in multielectron/multiproton redox reactions. Ultimately, the physiochemical properties of Fe–S clusters emerge from their underlying electronic structures. Owing to the quasi-degeneracy of the Fe 3d orbitals, the magnetic coupling of two or more of these ions produces a dense manifold of nearly degenerate, thermally accessible electronic states. While the ability of Fe–S clusters to sample these diverse electronic states is postulated to play a key role in their reactivity, what is not well understood are the factors that affect the nature, distribution, and interconversion of these states. We are particularly interested in elucidating how the primary and secondary coordination spheres dictate the individual site valences within the cluster, and the accessibility of excited states with alternative valance arrangements (“valence isomers”). Gaining insight into how, and to what extent, Fe–S proteins favor specific valence isomers is critical for understanding a range of energy-related processes, from electron-transfer reactions to challenging chemical transformations. Our approach to studying these phenomena is to perform spectroscopic measurements to determine the distribution of valences within protein and synthetic Fe–S clusters, over a range of temperature and time scales. These measurements will reveal the thermal distribution of valence isomers, as well as the barriers for interconverting these states. Using site-directed mutagenesis and chemical synthesis, we will vary the primary and secondary sphere properties of these clusters, and thereby uncover the structure-function relationships that control the valence electronic structure of Fe–S clusters, and, in doing so, reveal the atomic-level details pertaining to the transport of electrons/holes in these energy carriers."

In particular, it has shown DNA self-assembly to be a viable platform for arranging and controlling the organization of dye aggregates to enable exciton delocalization. Exciton delocalization and its electronic coherence are mediated by several key parameters. The team postulate, and show theoretically, that certain combinations of these parameters give rise to optically-accessible, entangled many-exciton states that can be tuned by tailoring the dye aggregate structure. This project (Phase II) builds on the successful Phase I project. The goal for Phase II is to establish dye aggregates with desirable structure-property relationships that enable realizing entangled states and to explore theoretically complementary approaches for measuring entanglement. The specific project objectives are centered around approaches to precisely control dye properties and arrangement—thereby enhancing both exciton delocalization and coherence—via targeted modifications of dyes and DNA scaffolds. Specifically, we will: (1) investigate the effects of dye and nucleic acid properties on quantum behavior; (2) measure exciton structure and dynamics via advanced steady-state and ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopies; (3) quantify DNA-templated dye placement precision; (4) develop Frenkel molecular exciton theory and computational methods; and (5) ultimately, (a) define design rules for a pathway to create, measure, and control entanglement and (b) develop the theory to enable the measurement of entanglement. The anticipated outcomes of these objectives include enhanced fundamental knowledge and ultimately design rules that define key dye structure-property relationships as they impact key parameters and various timescales governing quantum entanglement, modest infrastructure development, and continued student and staff resource development at Boise State. The project directly addresses DOE’s Basic Energy Sciences stated significant interest in the “creation and control of coherent phenomena in quantum systems emphasizing an improved understanding of entanglement and enhanced coherence lifetimes.”"

Goodwin Ave., Urbana, IL 61801 Essential materials for energy technologies tend to exhibit &ldquo;hierarchical&rdquo; functions &ndash; they perform multiple, inter-related tasks at different locations, across disparate length and time scales. To best support this heterogeneous function, there is a fundamental need to understand and direct formation of corresponding tailored hierarchical architectures. In particular, a wide variety of applications, from energy conversion and storage to sensing and gas separation, rely on oxide mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIECs). These critical ceramic materials catalyze reactions at their surfaces and transport ionic and electronic species. Ideally, MIECs should adopt hierarchical structures with 1) high surface areas, 2) surface compositions exhibiting high catalytic activity, and 3) microstructural connectivity in the direction needed for fast charge transport. In practice, however, MIECs are typically fabricated at elevated temperatures, leading to coarse, non-directional structures with poisoned (chemically segregated) surfaces. This work therefore applies a new approach, applying stimulated chemo-mechanical actuation to non-equilibrium films, to transform homogeneous MIECs into ideal hierarchical structures in situ. Key questions to be addressed, leveraging DOE user facilities and a novel contact-free high throughput optical approach, include: 1) how/why does the structure change across multiple length scales during transformation, 2) how/why do different process variables direct hierarchical structure evolution, and 3) how/why do the ionic/electronic transport and surface reactivity change during transformation? The new hierarchical structures demonstrate high surface catalytic activity with potential for improved device performance. Moreover, they serve as a platform to develop a fundamental understanding of MIEC processing-structure-property relationships, leading to rational design for energy applications."

This remarkable efficiency is achieved by rapid and regulated energy transport through a network of proteins over distances of > 25 nm. In nature, this network is held within a membrane environment but the majority of previous experiments have focused on energy transfer with the proteins in a non-physiological, detergent environment. The membrane environment is dynamic, with a mixture of lipids and proteins regulated by environmental stimuli. This proposal focuses on key deficits in our current understanding of the role of the membrane environment in energy transfer. We outline a series of experiments aimed at addressing the following open questions: How does energy transfer depend on the composition of the membrane environment? How does it depend on membrane organization? We address these questions through a mixed biochemical and spectroscopic approach. We build membrane discs, known as nanodiscs, to create a near-native environment for light-harvesting complexes. Nanodiscs are self-assembled phospholipid bilayers with embedded membrane proteins encircled by an amphiphilic belt. We control membrane size, composition, and protein crowding to achieve an experimental paradigm in which we can explore photosynthetic light harvesting in a near-native environment. We measure the photophysical pathways using ultrafast spectroscopy. By interrogating light-harvesting complexes in nanodiscs, we identify the role of the membrane environment in controlling the photophysics. Here, we focus on the light-harvesting and reaction center proteins from purple bacteria and green plants. The results from our work will uncover how the membrane environment controls long-distance energy transduction and its regulation in photosynthetic light harvesting. Understanding these mechanisms in natural systems allows us to identify the key design principles, which can, in turn, provide a blueprint for artificial light-harvesting devices."

Cold spray technology offers an effective solution to repair corrosion damage that can be applied at low temperature, therefore minimizing substrate heating, maintaining dimensional stability, and avoiding unwanted thermal effects (HAZ, thermal stresses, dilution layer formation, etc.). The repair will arrest crack growth, protect from further corrosion damage, and fully restore load carrying capacity of the component, and can be applied in-situ, eliminating the otherwise necessary component removal process. In Phase II, the project team selected structural materials and developed statistical material property data for future implementation efforts, evaluated surface preparation techniques and repair geometry effects, developed several advanced cold sprayed materials and testing methods, optimized the cold spray material through the development of high temperature stabilization techniques, designed, implemented and verified equipment modifications to enable in- situ repair within the LWR facility, and established working relationships with a LWR manufacturer, a DOE National Laboratory, and a large owner/operator, resulting in the identification of transition applications and demonstration of a cold spray repair on a LWR component. The phase IIA project will continue development of structural materials and transition cold spray by qualifying a repair in an in-situ application. VRC will work with our owner/operator contacts to develop in-situ cold spray repair, mockup demonstration, and code justification for cold spray in these applications. The team will develop novel material systems for LWR application, along with equipment augmentations and portable robotics for in-situ structural repair. This effort advances the state of the art in cold spray repair and develops the foundation for ASME code consideration, directly in line with the DOE’s need for in situ mitigation and repair of corrosion damage in LWR’s, offering owners/operators a cost-effective means of plant sustainment and reducing the overall maintenance burden of aging reactor components. This repair approach also improves the safety of LWR facilities, which provides both a benefit to the plant owner/operator, as well as the general public."

Ferroelectric thin films can be utilized in high-density and nonvolatile memories with low-power consumption, fast writing speed, and good cyclability. Since most utilities of ferroelectrics are derived from the polarization configuration and the domain switching, a fundamental understanding of the polarization state, domain pattern, and their coupling with other properties such as strain and defects is critical for developing new devices. This project aims to explore the fundamental properties including novel polarization states, domain patterns, flexoelectric and piezoelectric effects, phonon (lattice vibration) characteristics, electronic structures and their interplay in new ferroelectric materials—freestanding two-dimensional (2D) perovskite oxide films. As the freestanding films are super flexible and not confined by substrate, their physical properties can be profoundly altered by dopants, strain, and proximity in ways that are not previously possible with conventional thin films. Thus, new properties and phenomena, far different from bulk and substrate-supported films, can emerge. Specifically, the proposed research will address the following key questions: (1) what are the polarization states and domain patterns in 2D ferroelectric/multiferroic films when the film thickness approaches monolayer limit? (2) what are the effects of local strain (piezoelectricity) and strain gradient (flexoelectricity) on the polarization and domain structure in highly bent freestanding films? (3) what are the polarization states and electronic properties hosted in the emergent domain topologies? and (4) as the thickness of the 2D ferroelectric film approaches a few unit cells, what is the role of the surface states/terminations on the polarization and the lattice vibrational modes? These problems will be studied by utilizing novel scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) methods that are recently developed in the PI’s lab, which include atomic resolution real-space charge density imaging by 4D STEM, which allows us to measure the polarization with the both ionic displacement and charge distribution, and novel vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in STEM, which is capable of revealing phonon characteristics, lattice symmetry, and polarization configurations with ultrahigh spatial resolution. The polarization states, domain structures, and electronic properties measured by STEM imaging and EELS will be analyzed through the lens of their structural deformation and atomic scale charge density and then compared directly with phase field simulations and first principles density functional theory calculations. The proposed research will provide fundamental insights into the behavior and properties of 2D oxide perovskite thin films. With their mechanical flexibility and transferability to alternative substrates, freestanding oxide films offer a wide variety of opportunities for applying the strongly correlated phenomenon present in oxide materials toward new functionalities. This research will expand the foundational understanding that is necessary when designing such novel electronic devices.

These research goals complement the US Department of Energy’s investment in premier experimental facilities RHIC, JLab, and FRIB. By developing and applying the theoretical framework that underpins experimental results obtained at these forefront facilities, the Iowa State group helps to both interpret these results as well as make predictions for future experiments. In short, the Iowa State group is part of a comprehensive national program in theory and experiment through which the United States will maintain its leadership position in fundamental nuclear physics. The Iowa State University Nuclear Theory group provides a balanced program which consists of developing and applying (1) non-perturbative many-body theory for strong interactions, and (2) Quantum Chromodynamics and Electrodynamics for high-energy nuclear collisions. One overarching theme is the quest to understand the fundamental laws of nature in domains that impact our knowledge of both basic and applied physics. From a basic physics perspective, the Iowa State Nuclear Theory group seeks, for example, to discover the source of an emergent phenomenon, nuclear collective motion (such as rotational excitations). The group also seeks to understand how nuclear strong and electromagnetic interactions in very high energy collisions lead to the production of very heavy mesons with specific properties. To achieve success, the group works with Iowa State PhD students and with external collaborators in multi-faceted research projects often targeting a specific type of experiment such as neutrinoless double beta-decay or a specific fundamental phenomena such as the chiral magnetic anomaly. The Iowa State Nuclear Theory group leads research into the properties of cold and hot nuclear matter produced in high energy nuclear and hadron collisions. It investigates the intense color fields—known as the Color Glass Condensate—that permeate the nuclear matter and computes the phenomenological manifestations of these fields in particle spectra which are measured at the Large Hadron Collider and will be in the focus of the future Electron Ion Collider. It studies intense electromagnetic fields created in the ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions and the novel phenomena arising from the interaction of these fields with the topological states of the nuclear matter. The group develops cross-disciplinary applications that share the common analytical framework: the scope of their scientific interests includes the axions, which is the leading dark matter candidate, and the topological materials, such as the Weyl semimetals. The Iowa State Nuclear Theory group also aims to develop the predictive theory and methods that will provide access to a wide range of low-energy reactions in light nuclei that are important to both astrophysics and to possible fusion applications. From an applied physics perspective, advances in fundamental nuclear physics can lead to improved applications in nuclear medicine and nuclear energy. Examples of isotopes for therapy and new accelerators in hospitals for treating cancer would not have been possible without past investments in the basic physics research. Future breakthrough applications are difficult to predict but innovative schemes for fusion energy is one area of potential future success. Out of many possibilities, one can mention the prospect of developing a robust predictive theory of light-ion reactions such a proton + Boron-11 going through excited resonant states of Carbon-12 and yielding three Helium-4 nuclei plus excess energy without producing neutrons. Here, a first principles description of this reaction is still lacking and, as a result, there are uncertainties on probabilities for this reaction to occur in any future fusion device. The Iowa State Nuclear Theory group aims to develop a robust theory of the resonant excited states of Carbon-12 which are the critical intermediate states of this reaction. Through successful competitive applications, the researchers at Iowa State University utilize the Department of Energy's Leadership-Class computational facilities at Argonne National Lab and its high-performance computer facilities at its National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) in order to perform numerical simulations with their theoretical frameworks for detailed predictions of experimental results.

These 3D magnetic fields produce significant changes in the interaction of heat, particles and radiation from these plasmas with vacuum vessel material surfaces that needs to be predicted and controlled in burning fusion reactors. A major goal of the proposed work is developing control scenarios for naturally occurring transients due to edge instabilities (ELMs) that limit the performance and first wall lifetime of ITER, the proposed New Tokamak User Facility (NTUF), and other burning plasma devices. The research goals proposed address two of the four primary research objectives in FESAC 2014: 1) control of deleterious transient events, and 2) taming the plasma-material interface, as described in the DoE’s “Fusion Energy Sciences: A Ten-Year Perspective (2015– 2025)”. The project is divided into four research thrusts: 1) Develop realistic multi-mode modeling of externally applied fields and plasma response, 2) Understand the limitations of linear and nonlinear MHD models through validation of their predictions against available experimental data, 3) Understand the physics of magnetic island bifurcations and compare model predictions to available experimental measurements, and 4) Explore 3D fields for establishing innovative boundary radiative mantle scenarios for next-step, long-pulse burning plasmas. Thrust 1 will carry out resistive MHD simulations of the plasma response to 3D magnetic field perturbations. Thrust 1 will also employ Fractional Laplacian Spectral analytical code to model energy transport in stochastic magnetic fields. Results from this thrust will improve understanding of toroidal multi-mode effects in fusion devices, such as ITER. Thrust 2 will perform plasma response simulations with applied 3D perturbations using the nimrod resistive MHD code. Thrust 2 will compare nimrod predictions to experimental measurements on DIII-D and KSTAR. Thrust 2 will also develop synthetic diagnostics for validation studies. Thrust 3 will perform nimrod simulations of tokamak discharges to understand magnetic island bifurcations. Thrust 3 will determine the impact of island bifurcations on electron collisional transport. Thrust 4 will investigate novel approaches for creating cold, high density, stable radiating boundary and divertor plasma solutions needed to dissipate and control the energy and particle exhaust from burning plasmas, such as those planned for ITER. The proposed research will result in a substantial step toward establishing a robust operating scenario for controlling transients due to ELMs, which is fully compatible with radiative boundary plasmas. Demonstrating scenario such as this is urgently needed for achieving the ITER mission and for the development of fusion plasma physics adapted for the advanced reactor regimes required for generating net electrical power."

PEF is a 100 % bio-based polymer derived from plants having the potential to replace the plastic industry’s giant polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is a durable material derived from conventional resources. Commercially, the PEF has been produced in two steps: (1) 2,5-Furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from 5-HMF oxidation (ii) polycondensation of FDCA and ethylene glycol. The produced PEF from 5-HMF has a negative impact on the polyester properties (coloration, thermal instability, decreased electrical performance, and potential environmental and health problems) owing to sugar impurities in FDCA and the residual amount of metals in the final product PEF. ADEM proposes an innovative two-step DBD plasma-assisted process for PEF synthesis using CO2. In the 1st step, ADEM proposes an unique plasma-catalytic approach for CO2 carboxylation in a gas- solid reaction scheme to produce FDCA under atmospheric pressure. ADEM proposes a similar approach for the second step of polycondensation reaction between FDCA and ethylene glycol. The proposed process can provide potential benefits: reduction in energy consumption, faster reaction time, solvents, and no expensive catalysts. No external heat supply is required to activate reactants as the energy supply from plasma. Advanced Energy Materials LLC (ADEM) has been developing several nanowire-based catalysts which exhibit higher performance and durability due to non-sintering and high dispersions (or compositions) of catalytically active sites. Phase I of the proposed project involves four major components: (1) demonstrate the FDCA synthesis using CO2 and 2-furoate using the proposed process at 10-30 Lpm/kW of throughput with the assistance of nanowire support, optimize the process conditions to improve the conversion and selectivity; (2) demonstrate the PEF synthesis from polycondensation of FDCA and ethylene glycol under similar plasma approach and find out the feasibility of recycling of nanowire supports. (3) Techno-economic and life cycle analysis for cost-effective production of PEF and perform technical validation. (4) Program management and reporting the data. The rapid growth of the plastics industry demands greener plastics that are developed from renewable biomass. The utilization of CO2 as a feedstock ultimately decreases CO2 emissions, a major anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). The development of CO2 utilization technologies is attracted considerable attention in recent years due to new government policies. The global market for PEF is rapidly growing at a CAGR of 7.12%.

The ISAN system includes active monitoring module which integrate guided wave with an improved time of arrival (TOA) analysis and signal processing algorithm for continuous internal pressure, temperature and fission gas composition monitoring and related helium leakage detection. The ISAN system works in a radiation environment and will be installed on the rails located external to the canister and attached to the shield wall internal to the canister. The ISAN system integrates sensor network hardware with a control software package for real-time pressure and temperature variation, and fission gas composition monitoring and accurate helium leakage detection. During the Phase I program, we will build an ISAN prototype and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The prototype ISAN system includes sensor system hardware, accompanying software tools to control and operate the hardware, and data analysis algorithms to detect internal pressure and temperature variation, fission gas composition, and potential helium leakage area using acquired data. We will build a machine learning classification algorithm to identify the wave signal from environment noise for robust prototype performance. The proposed technology is capable of monitor internal conditions on SNF-DSC during long-term storage and transportation. The unique advantages are radiation endurance sensor array and acoustic gas sensor hardware system, which is able to monitor several factors including pressure, temperature, fission gas composition and helium leakage, and the system is easy to operate and provide advanced signal process algorithm software package. This technology is interested by ORANO/TN America, and NAC International, and will be field tested on real canister. This technology also can be used in industrial pressure vessel health monitoring. We therefore envision that the proposed ISAN technology will be widely applicable in different scenarios."
Synthetic metabolic pathways and biosensors to expand lignin-based bioconversion,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022220,"Neidle, Ellen","Ellen.Neidle@theuniversityofgeorgiaresearchfoundation,inc.","['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","The lignin portion of lignocellulosic biomass is extremely abundant and energy rich but underutilized. Therefore, the ability to convert this renewable resource to valuable compounds is an important environmental goal to enable biorefineries to reach their full commercial potential and be competitive with petroleum-based industries. This project focuses on new methods and approaches to help accomplish this goal by harnessing the power of a soil bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1. The premise of this approach is that the natural microbial capabilities that are responsible for slow lignin degradation in Nature can be engineered for increased metabolism in the laboratory. This project will expand the ability of this bacterium to degrade a lignin-derived aromatic substrate, syringol. Expansion of syringol metabolism will also facilitate the metabolism of other aromatic compounds and will enable the synthesis of wax esters. These bacterial storage compounds have important commercial uses. Additional industrially relevant compounds can be derived from wax esters. A synthetic biological pathway will be constructed and optimized using novel biosensors and protein engineering methods. This project will generate new strains and enzymes to support lignin valorization. ADP1 will be developed as a platform organism and as a generator of portable resources (enzymes and pathways) for use in other organisms. Tools will also be developed that will be broadly useful for the metabolic engineering of aromatic compounds. Knowledge and resources from this project will be important not only for the biodegradation of lignin but for the bioeconomy in general. Efforts to move away from fossil fuels involve many issues concerning aromatic compounds, including the synthesis and degradation of plastic polymers."
A gene-editing system for large-scale fungal phenotyping in a model wood decomposer,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022151,"Zhang, Jiwei",Jiwei.Zhang@regentsoftheuniversityofminnesota,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Wood decay fungi offer industrially-relevant pathways to extract carbohydrates from lignocellulose, and their mechanisms have broad relevance to global carbon cycling. White rot-type fungi use ligninolytic enzymes (e.g., lignin peroxidases) to break down the lignin barrier, while brown rot fungi use non-enzymatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) mechanisms to modify lignin and selectively extract sugars. Brown rot fungi evolved from white rot ancestral lines multiple times, and from a process efficiency standpoint they represent a pathway ‘upgrade’ to approaches that mimic white rot. Brown rot is generally faster than white rot, the mechanism selectively releases soluble sugars, and it leaves lignin relatively intact as a by-product (value addition). These fungi achieved this, evolutionarily, by contracting rather than enhancing their repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZys), shedding ~65% of their ancestral CAZy genes, on average. Although DOE mission-relevance is clear, and we have made major genomically-informed advances, progress is limited by an inability to manipulate genes in any brown rot fungal strain. Knowledge Gaps and Hypothesis: There are targeted gaps that we could address with the development of a brown rot fungal strain as a gene-editing system. First, brown rot fungi stagger the ROS pathways ahead of hydrolytic enzymes to degrade wood, something we call the ‘two-step’ (oxidation-then-hydrolysis). Multi-omics approaches have advanced our knowledge of the two-step, but the functions of genes involved remain unverified and ambiguous. Second, we have learned that gene regulatory mechanisms have been adapted in brown rot fungi to precisely control and consolidate the two steps of brown rot, but little is known about this process. This limits our ability to refer to brown rot gene functions from other fungi with known decay pathways. Third, the majority of genes identified by multi-omics are of hypothetical/unknown function, leaving major gaps for discovering novel functional genes. We hypothesize that developing a versatile fungal platform, combining systems biology and gene-editing for large-scale phenotypic screens, can facilitate to validate/investigate the distinctive genetic inventories adapted by brown rot. Research Plan: Integrating systems biology, genome-editing, and network modeling to address these key gaps, our goal in this project is to provide stand-alone tools and resources for discovering novel fungal genetic features that can also be used in combination to advance relevant brown rot research in the post-genomic era. Our objective 1 is to optimize a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing system based on the established genetic manipulation platform in brown rot fungi, and to use it for targeting genes that have been isolated by multi-omics studies. This will generate a single-gene mutant library for phenotypic studies. Our objective 2 is to build an extensive carbon utilization network using transcriptomic analyses and network modeling, discovering the distinctive gene regulation features adapted by brown rot. Leveraging this objective, we will also complement the gene pool for large-scale phenotypic screening. Finally, objective 3 aims to develop a pipeline to use the multiplexing sgRNA library for genome editing, building the mutant library for large-scale phenotypic screens. This will allow us to rapidly link genotype to the phenotypes that enable brown rot efficacy. Overall, the work will aid in the development of high-throughput genetic tools to elucidate fundamental microbial processes relevant to the production of advanced biofuels and bioproducts. The fundamental understanding of brown rot will advance new engineering designs for lignocellulose bioconversion. We also anticipate this will be a high-reward project that yields a wealth of publicly available data and mutant libraries as tools to push this field forward."

To the consumer, PET is likely most recognizable as the plastic used to make beverage bottles. Like many plastics, traditional mechanical or chemical means of PET deconstruction and upcycling are costly and inefficient. Recently, biological enzymes capable of breaking down PET into its basic building blocks (terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol) have garnered significant attention as an attractive means of dealing with the plastic problem. These enzymes are currently undergoing pilot studies for implementation in enzyme-based recycling. However, there are significant limitations to current enzymes, including the need to perform costly pre-processing of the plastic waste before the enzymes are able to work. Further optimization of these enzymes is necessary to make the process profitable and thereby incentivize commercialization of this biology-based green recycling technology. We aim to apply recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning to design new versions of enzymes capable of breaking down PET. Based on preliminary experiments, we believe we can create a highly diverse set of enzymes that have exceptional properties useful for industrial recycling. Testing these enzymes is typically labor intensive, but using a new robotically-enabled platform we will be able to experimentally characterize key enzymatic properties of thousands of these designed enzymes. In addition to applying machine learning approaches to design new enzymes, we have developed and will apply a novel method that, by testing many small changes in enzyme structure, enables us to optimize existing enzymes that are known to break down plastic. Ultimately, we believe that the result of these studies will be the discovery of highly-optimized enzymes capable of breaking down PET plastics in an industrial recycling setting, enabling a powerful and green solution to the plastic problem."

Despite their potential for lignocellulosic bioprocessing, no non-destructive, real-time imaging tools exist to probe anaerobic fungi or the action of their cellulosomes across spatial and temporal scales. We will develop new bioimaging approaches to learn how anaerobic fungi orchestrate lignocellulose degradation through their unique multi-protein cellulosomes &ndash; and how these fungi are able to access carbohydrate biopolymers encased in lignin. Multiplexed imaging tools based on the synthesis of novel quantum dot (QD) nanobody fusions targeted at different components of fungal cellulosomes will reveal where cellulosome components are localized within the fungal ultrastructure and at the interface with lignocellulose. Our approach benefits from a suite of new genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data obtained for three strains of anaerobic fungi, which enables the synthesis of custom quantum dot and nanobody probes to localize cellulosomes and track their dynamics without suffering photobleaching effects. We will also leverage a cell-free production pipeline to reconstitute quantum dot-tagged fungal cellulosomes in vitroand characterize enzyme rearrangement, kinetics, substrate breakdown, and high-resolution structure via Cryo-EM. As a complementary approach, we will advance genetic tools for the anaerobic fungi to conjugate quantum dot probes onto cellulosome components in vivo, which further enables hypothesis testing of protein function in genetically recalcitrant anaerobic systems.

Computational modeling and new data-driven statistical inference methods provide key scientific approaches for developing practically applicable methods that bridge the gap from molecular scale to heterogeneity of the macroscopic scale. In the process of optimizing materials, processes, and systems for energy-related applications, a compromise between competing requirements often leads to structural patterns on an intermediate length scale. It is the link between these extremes in scales that is commonly referred to as mesoscale, where classical, quantum, and nanoscale science meet and where defects, interfaces, and non-equilibrium states are very common. Hence, macroscales are connected to microscales by a hierarchy of mesoscale structures that can be observed and controlled. Generally, inhomogeneities, fronts, and interfaces disrupt homogeneity and trigger new bands of scales that cause anisotropy and long-range (nonlocal) interactions. Hence, multiscale problems subject to inhomogeneous cascades due to the action of interfaces require developing new mathematical theory, e.g., nonlocal operators, and new algorithmic tools, such as deep learning (DL). This presents challenges for multiscale modeling capturing inhomogeneous cascades-of-scales, PhILMs aims to address challenges in these application areas by developing new mathematical and computational tools using approaches from machine learning, meshfree methods, and non-local operator formulations.

These dynamics occur at the attosecond (billionth of a billionth of a second) time scale and involve a complex interplay of electron motion coupled to the movement of the atoms in a crystal lattice. The objective of this research is to develop computer simulation tools for predicting the ultrafast response of materials subjected to intense pulses of light. These tools are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms and for interpreting and motivating attosecond experiments. First-principles approaches for this type of dynamics, especially for photochemistry-like processes near dopants and defects, are lacking. This project will develop density functional theory-based methods for attosecond electron/nuclear dynamics in semiconductors and insulators under the influence of high-intensity and/or high-energy (X-ray) laser pulses.

Katz, Johns Hopkins University (Principal Investigator) Arthur E. Bragg and Daniel H. Reich, Johns Hopkins University (Co-Investigators) The broad theme of this project is the design of plastic composites for energy-related electronics applications. In the preceding grant period, we showed that static electricity can be captured by microscopic crystals of carbon-based compounds mixed with plastics. This static electricity can be used to control when electronic devices turn on and off, and can allow more electrical energy to be stored in the plastics. In this new project period, we will investigate how these crystals might be modified so that they can store even more electrical energy, can be made to emit more light in luminescent devices, and can be the active subunits in logic and computing technologies. The research team will design and make compounds that attract static electricity and that keep the electrical charges more stable in crystals of the compounds than they are in the surrounding plastic materials. This requires chemical reactions to make the compounds and heat-based processes to form the crystals. The crystals are characterized in multiple ways: the arrangements of the molecules are determined by x-ray reflections from the molecules; the static charge is measured as a voltage on microscopic size scales, analogous to the voltage on the ends of batteries; and microscopes that consist of probes that move over the plastic films will measure the size and shape of the microstructures and how much electricity they can either store or move. The effects of the charges on light emission are measured by shining laser light on the crystals and measuring the colors and intensities of the light that is emitted and the time it takes for this emission. These new plastic mixtures will be organized in different ways. For example, the microscopic structures can have different sizes and shapes, they can be coated with films that confine the static charges in the crystals, and they can be in different layers of the plastics when the layers are stacked on top of each other so that the charges add together in specific locations of the plastics. The materials will be tested in electronic devices, modified so that the maximum amount of fundamental information can be obtained. We will gain fundamental information about how molecules assemble to form microstructures in plastics, and what details of the crystal structures are most important for storing the static electricity. We will uncover the properties of the electrical charges when the crystals reach their minimum possible size. The work is relevant to increasing the efficiency of storing the energy that can be generated by solar cells and windmills, using electricity for lighting and displays, and designing new electronic circuitry for information storage and computing. The overall product of this project is a synthesis, film formation, and characterization platform that will provide plastic blends and composites organized and designed for multiple electronic energy-relevant purposes, especially the separation of positive and negative charges. The work of this proposal is heavily focused on chemistry, materials science, and electronics, for ultimate application to efficient energy capture and use."

The annual algal blooms threaten water quality of Lake Erie and surrounding communities have seen contaminated drinking water, closed beaches, and damage to fishing and tourism industries. In one study, the algal blooms impose an equivalent annual cost equal to $272M due to the algae’s impact. The algae grows out of control when excessive phosphorus enters the lake. The phosphorus comes from agricultural fertilizers, wastewater, and septic systems up-stream of the lake. This small business proposes to work with local organizations to enable the economic collection of algae and produce a valuable product (bio-char) through pyrolysis, resulting in net negative emissions, carbon sequestration, and phosphorus reduction. This small business has developed a small-scale, innovative bio-gas (evaporated bio-oils and syngas) burner that provides heat necessary for pyrolysis. PSI will use these community driven design specifications to adapt its small-scale pyrolysis technology to a larger pilot plant to convert algae to bio-char. Algal turf scrubber products already exist for harvesting algae from fresh water, but the technology developed in this program will incentivize the use of algal turf scrubber or other harvesting methods in water streams leading to Lake Erie. This will transform local sources of biomass to biochar and prevent harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie. Biochar will be used as fertilizer for surrounding communities and farms, displacing conventional fertilizers and thereby reducing the amount of new phosphorus added to the ecosystem. During Phase I, this small business will: (1) engage communities with assistance from a local organizations to discuss process requirements, such as debris, separation of materials, size requirements, algae throughput, location, drying options, and convert these process requirements into design requirements, (2) use community-driven design requirements to modify existing lab-scale self-sustaining pyrolysis technology for prototype design, (3) perform proof-of- concept testing and demonstrate the production of biochar from algae using biogas combustion, (4) create design specifications related to community needs, and (5) conduct techno-economic analysis of the process to guide the Phase II program. The proposed approach will demonstrate an economically viable process to produce low-cost biochar for soil amendment applications and reduce the damage to surrounding communities due to algal blooms."

As the next generation energy-relevant materials, metastable polymers are more robust, more responsive, and more durable than traditional materials. The current discovery of metastable polymers heavily relies on physical methods, such as rapid cooling and high-pressure treatment; however, a lack of understanding of their formation kinetics severely limits the discovery of new metastable materials. This research addresses a critical need to develop chemical methods to construct polymer materials with clearly delineated kinetic pathways and outstanding macroscale properties. The research team formed by specialists in materials syntheses and polymer simulations is developing new kinetically trapped polymer materials with re-configurable networks and emergent macroscale properties. These materials are designed based on cyclodextrin-poly(pseudo)rotaxanes, a mechanically interlocked molecular architecture wherein multiple cyclodextrin rings are threaded onto an axle of polyethylene glycol. By installing ring threading kinetic speed bumps and stoppers on the polyethylene glycol chain, metastable polypseudorotaxanes with segregated cyclodextrin blocks are kinetically generated and crystallized as physically crosslinked networks. The chemical modulations of the speed bumps, stoppers, and polymer axle structures change the polypseudorotaxanes’ metastable states at the nano and mesoscales, which diverge the kinetically trapped network architectures to form different metastable hydrogels. Covalently crosslinking these hydrogels affords new polyrotaxane materials, possessing enhanced mechanical robustness and mechano-responsiveness. The work studied here establishes principles toward the rational design of kinetically trapped materials from a bottom-up approach. The method also enables the on-demand development of mechanically robust and responsive 3D-printable polyrotaxane networks. This investigation is the first step toward developing polymer materials that operate out-of-equilibrium upon light and chemical mass dissipation, mimicking sunlight-powered ecosystems."

Advances in the quality of the materials used to realize the quantum bits (qubits) are key to reduce the decoherence of the qubits states and therefore the qubits’ error rate. Topological qubits, by using ground-state non-abelian anyons, such as Majorana modes, to encode the logical states, are intrinsically protected from decoherence, and so offer a very attractive solution to the major obstacle on the way to a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Higher materials’ quality, combined with the “topological protection” of topological qubits are expected to lead to error rates low enough to allow the realization of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. In addition, devices that can be tuned into a quantum topological state offer unprecedented capabilities for sensing applications. The proposed experiment-theory collaborative research program aims to combine materials advances and the topological approach to achieve novel, high quality, semiconductor-based structures and Josephson junctions, to address the major hurdle on the path to a quantum computer, and to realize new sensors with novel capabilities. The semiconductor structures will be grown via molecular beam epitaxy to reduce as much as possible the amount of disorder in the devices. InAs quantum wells, and InAs/GaSb double quantum wells, proximitized by superconducting Al, will be obtained and used to fabricate high quality topological Josephson junctions. Devices based on InAs/GaSb double quantum wells have the potential to support Majorana modes even when no magnetic field is present. This would be a significant achievement because it would allow a much greater freedom in the layout of networks of topological qubits. To predict and describe the devices’ quantum behavior, low energy effective models will be developed starting from a microscopic approach in which the spatial profiles of the quantum states and the profile of the electrostatic potential are obtained self-consistently. Via a tight theory-experiment feedback loop, the semiconductor structures will be optimized to achieve the highest quality and to obtain devices with robust topological states and the best sensing capabilities. The same tight theory-experiment feedback loop will be used to unambiguously identify the topological phases of the fabricated Josephson junctions, and detect the presence of Majoranas. The outcomes of the proposed research will constitute a significant advance toward the realization of artificial quantum-coherent systems with new functionalities for quantum information science by providing two-dimensional, planar, semiconductor-based, scalable, architectures for the realization of topological qubits.

To transform specialty polyolefin production from relying on traditional feedstocks to using waste polyolefins as a new, greener feedstock is a significant chemical challenge, because polyolefins have exceptional chemical and thermal stability. Thus, our proposed work endeavors to master the chemical mechanisms of (1) polyolefin dehydrogenation (converts carbon-carbon single bonds to double bonds) and (2) chemical functionalization to convert the modified polyolefins into copolymers. Note that commercially successful polyethylene copolymers are often synthesized with just 1 – 10 mol% of the functional comonomer, indicating that only 0.5 – 5% of the backbone carbon atoms in the waste polyethylene need to be converted to produce more sustainable specialty polyolefins. In addition, several of the new chemical transformations investigated will produce new polymers, for example sulfonated polyethylenes and functionalized polypropylenes. Our innovative approach to transforming polyolefin waste into functionalized polyolefins has two key attributes. First, polymer molecular weight will be maintained or increased through the transformations by avoiding reactions that induce chain scission. This approach is significantly more energy efficient than reducing a polymer to monomers, purifying the monomers, and then repolymerizing. Second, we are targeting energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly reactions, so that our foundational work can be readily transformed to practice. While our primary effort will focus on a two-step chemical route, we will also investigate one-step chemical routes to simultaneously dehydrogenate and functionalize polyolefins for additional gains in energy efficiency. Our synthetic efforts will be complimented by extensive polymer property measurements and benchmarking against commercial polymers. Our distinctive strategy for converting waste polyolefins into higher-value functionalized polyolefins is expected to be applicable to both single- and mixed-stream polyolefin waste. Our approach to converting waste commodity polymers into specialty polymers is a viable and valuable step toward a comprehensive effort to reduce polymer waste, recover valuable carbon building blocks, and reduce the energy used to make specialty polymers. Moreover, we anticipate that our foundational work will expand the conversion of waste plastics as a feedstock in the production of an ever-increasing range of high-value plastics."
"Operando atomistic characterization of structural, physical, and chemical characteristics of semiconductor/metal interfaces on functioning hybrid photocatalysts",Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021362,"Linic, Suljo",Suljo.Linic@regentsoftheuniversityofmichigan,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Materials that have received the most attention in photocatalysis (including solar water splitting) are hybrids that contain a semiconductor light absorber and an attached metal electrocatalyst. In these systems, the semiconductor serves to provide an electromotive force (voltage) that is used by the electrocatalyst nanoparticles to perform the reaction. Our understanding of the photocatalytic function of these hybrid materials is based on relatively simple models, where the semiconductor and metal electrocatalyst are essentially treated as independent entities, with the interface between them controlling only the inherent barrier height (through classical Schottky model or models involving Fermi level pinning). It is often assumed that: (i) the interface is static and that it does not evolve or change under different reactions conditions, and (ii) that the electrocatalytic reactions take place exclusively on the electrocatalyst surface, and the role of the interfacial sites in driving the electrocatalytic reactions is almost completely neglected. We propose to rigorously examine the assumptions (i) and (ii) above. More specifically, we hypothesize that: 1. Under photocatalytic conditions the interfacial sites, where an electrocatalyst attaches to a semiconductor, are dynamic, and its structural and physical properties change as the function of external conditions. An example of this dynamic behavior is that under the conditions of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the sites at the semiconductor/metal interface can be either heavily oxidized or even reduced, depending on the external conditions (for example, the potential of the working electrode in a 3-electrode setup). 2. The sites at the interface serve as the most active sites where the electrochemical transformations take place with higher rates compared to the other sites. We propose to scrutinize the two hypotheses by using a combined experimental/modeling approach. We will employ a range of experimental techniques designed to analyze semiconductor/electrocatalyst interfaces under working conditions. These include atomistic level geometric characterization using state-of-the-art x-ray absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy as well as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. All these techniques are available in-house and most are compatible with our custom-built micro-fluidic cells designed for operando characterization of working materials. The experimental analysis will be closely coupled with modeling work, which will utilize quantum computational tools (mainly advanced density functional theory (DFT)) coupled with ab-initio atomistic thermodynamic methodology. These efforts will allow us to compute from first principles the free energy of various interfacial structures and assess their thermodynamic stability. The DFT approaches will also be used to study the relevant chemical reactions taking place at the interfaces. Our studies will center on a number of carefully selected semiconductor/electrocatalyst model systems, which span a range of hybrid materials of interest. These systems include well-defined model systems with metal electrocatalysts (Ni or Ir) deposited, in the form of layers or size-specific nanoparticles, on top of Si (protected with thin layers of TiO2 or HfO2) absorbers. We will focus on OER as a model reaction of critical interest because of its sluggish kinetics. Our objective is to paint a comprehensive picture about the role of the interfaces in photocatalysis. Developing comprehensive and accurate models for structural, physical and chemical properties of functioning semiconductor/electrocatalyst interfaces will not only allow us to develop a deeper understanding of these systems, but it will also allow us to develop a framework for the rational design of more efficient and novel photocatalytic systems."

Cole, University of Nebraska-Lincoln (Co-Principal Investigator) Dr. Jeffrey E. Shield, University of Nebraska-Lincoln (Co-Principal Investigator) The research goal of this EPSCoR-DOE partnership is to mitigate defects in parts made using a new type of additive manufacturing (AM) process called metal Big Area Additive Manufacturing (m-BAAM). To realize this goal, the PIs will detect and correct defects in the part as it is being printed by combining fundamental knowledge of the thermal physics and metallurgy of m-BAAM with in-process sensor data. Developed at the DOE-funded Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the m-BAAM process involves one or more robots working together to produce a part by fusing metal wire layer-by-layer using arc welding. The process can print large metal parts such as turbine blades, which is not possible using other AM processes. In addition, m-BAAM production rates are more than ten times faster than other AM processes while requiring one-tenth of the material cost. Despite their potential to become a critical force multiplier in the energy generation industry, m-BAAM parts may fail to print accurately due to retention of heat and uneven cooling. Overheating and anomalous cooling rates in turn can cause inconsistencies in the microstructure, leading to sudden failure when used in safety-critical applications. In other words, flaw formation in m-BAAM parts is governed by the thermal history – intensity and spatial distribution of heat inside the part during printing. The thermal history is a complex function of the part shape and process settings such as welding energy, path taken by the welding torch for deposition (tool path), wire feed rate, among others. Consequently, to ensure consistent part quality, it is essential to understand, predict, and control the causal effect of process parameters and part shape on thermal history. Existing proprietary finite-element based computational tools to predict thermal history are relatively slow, expensive, and require expert knowledge. Thus, developing fast, inexpensive, accurate, and easy to use thermal simulation tools and establishing automated process correction to prevent flaws are urgent priorities for m-BAAM researchers. To address these needs, the PIs will realize three objectives: Predict the temperature distribution of m-BAAM parts using the graph theory approach, which predicts the thermal history of AM parts ten times faster than finite element models and with an error of less than 10 percent. Predict microstructure of m-BAAM parts using the temperature distribution and cooling rate estimated using graph theory coupled with the metallurgical phase transformation behavior of the material. Correct process faults in m-BAAM using model-based feed-forward control. By using knowledge of the fundamental thermal physics, as opposed to trail-and-error empirical studies, this work will accelerate the time-to-market of m-BAAM parts, which are envisioned to become a critical force multiplier in the manufacturing and energy infrastructure of the nation."

The project will be a collaboration between the University of Nebraska – Lincoln (UNL) and the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator (BELLA) Center at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Novel laser-driven accelerators have the potential to become an essential part of future high-brightness accelerator technology. In particular, laser-wakefield accelerators (LWFA), which are based on laser-plasma interactions, can produce electron bunches with an emittance comparable to that of conventional accelerators from a vastly more compact setup. However, LWFA electron beams currently do not have some of the parameters required by many applications. This project will be a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of a novel electron injector scheme with a simple experimental configuration. Specifically, our approach is based on an ultrathin gas target capable of generating high plasma densities. We will investigate a widely unexplored regime as a novel electron injection method for laser-driven accelerators to produce relativistic high-brightness electron beams from compact setups. Our method has the potential to lead to an electron injector design or a high-current electron beam source, both of which can be efficiently driven by a comparably modest peak-intensity laser. These improvements mean that an LWFA can be driven by lasers with a much lower peak power enabling high repetition-rate operation and reduced system complexity. This approach has the potential to become a compact, high repetition rate source of electron beams or a front-end of a future laser-based accelerators.We will also develop a novel diagnostic for directly observing short-wavelength plasma wave with µm spatial and femtosecond temporal resolution. We will investigate advanced methods to control and enhance the acceleration mechanism and the quality of the generated electron bunches. In addition to the technological applications of this novel target, this project will make significant theoretical advances in the understanding of LWFA systems.The small dimensions of the target combined with high-resolution diagnostics will not only test current plasma theory but will also enable a high-fidelity comparison to simulations. The project will also investigate fundamental laser-plasma interactions."

These additives (promoters) are usually introduced in very small amounts (mmol per gram of catalyst) covering a fraction of the catalytically active surface. While these chemical promoters have dramatic impact on the performance of many solid catalysts, in terms of enhancing rates of reactions or improving the selectivity towards the desired products, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of promotion is rather limited. The central objective of this project is to investigate the role of chemical promoters in catalytic reactions on metal surfaces. We will focus on ethylene epoxidation on promoted silver (Ag) nanoparticle catalysts, one of the largest commercial catalytic processes, as a case study. This process employs Ag nanoparticle catalysts supported on alumina and promoted with Cesium (Cs), Rhenium (Re), Chlorine (Cl) and Molybdenum (Mo). The addition of these promoters significantly enhances the selectivity of the process towards the desired products. The central objectives of the proposal are to: (i) identify the structural (atomistic organization), physical and chemical properties of the promoted metal surfaces, (ii) unearth the molecular complex (the atomistic structure motif) that a promoter has when on a metal surface under reaction conditions, (iii) uncover the mechanisms by which promoters affect the outcome of chemical transformations. These objectives will be met by a combined experimental/theoretical approach that will integrate the state-of-the-art computational methodology (machine learning and quantum chemical calculations) with the cutting-edge spectroscopic studies of non-model catalysts under relevant conditions. Ultimately, our intent is to develop realistic models that could be used to a priori predict when certain additives could be helpful in enhancing a catalytic process."

Batteries using high-capacity lithium metal anode hold promise due to their high energy densities to extend driving range and lower costs. Currently, an advanced electrolyte is urgently needed to stabilize lithium metal anode for longer battery life. In this project, a novel class of high-energy-density batteries will be developed by dropping lithium metal anode into conventional lithium-ion battery, enabled by an advanced liquid electrolyte. The development process employs a closed-loop machine learning and high-throughput robotic experimentation workflow, which allows for an efficient search of the vast chemical and material space for possible electrolytes. This interdisciplinary approach will produce advanced liquid electrolytes offering longer cycle life and lower cost in a more efficient manner than the currently employed Edisonian processes. The technical and commercial feasibility have been proven. A promising electrolyte with improved properties and cell performance were discovered. The battery cycle life was increased to projected 1409 cycles from 96 cycles thanks to the improvements on electrolyte lithium coulombic efficiency (98.2%), voltage window (4.5 V), and ionic conductivity (8 mS/cm). An invention disclosure has been submitted. The electrolyte discovery was made possible in a search space of 28 electrolyte ingredients by the machine learning and robotics workflow, which has demonstrated high electrolyte prediction-actual data correlation of 98.6%, accurate early- cycle prediction on cell performance (82.6% accuracy), and a high-throughput 512 testing samples per month. Through customer discovery efforts, an electrolyte purchase order was received from a battery company. In Phase 2, a high-performance electrolyte will be achieved by closed-loop screening =1000 unique electrolyte formulations using the machine learning and robotics workflow and by further validating it in =2 Ah large format cells. The electrolyte production will be scaled up to 10 kilograms/batch. Both the electrolyte product and its customers will be ready for commercial applications by the end of this period. This liquid electrolyte technology has direct applicability to high-energy-density lithium batteries for electric vehicle application. Upon the success of this project in Phase 2, the commercialization of the electrolyte will accelerate the wide deployment of high-energy-density vehicle batteries and enable a large market penetration of electric vehicles.

Examples are accelerator enclosures, nuclear plants, fusion and nuclear medicine facilities. Several well-tested high-fidelity Monte Carlo codes can be used to perform such simulations, but they include many “manual” programming and integration tasks. Moreover, they often use approximate representation of complex CAD geometries and lack a user-friendly interface allowing users to set up and execute the required workflows in a streamlined and errorproof fashion. Tech-X Corporation, in collaboration with SLAC and FNAL, will develop a framework for streamlined calculation of residual dose using MARS15 and Geant4 Monte Carlo codes. The framework will allow definition of complex geometries from CAD and have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to set up simulations without the programming knowledge and manual editing of the input files and to run simulations on a variety of computing resources.

One of the problems currently faced is to obtain uniform device yield over a wafer, as there can be large variations in plasma conditions at the wafer edge. Various solutions, such as “focus rings”, have been proposed, but trying out each of these solutions can be expensive and time consuming with the need to shut down the chamber, insert a new device, restart the chamber, process a wafer, and measure the results. The process of improvement could be accelerated with computational modeling. However, there is a relative lack of CAE (Computationally Aided Engineering) software that can address this problem including modeling an entire chamber and computing the wafer impacting ion distributions. In addition, since these problems are computationally large, there is the problem of access to sufficient computational resources to address these problems. Tech-X will develop a GPU enabled computational application that will be able to address the needs of the plasma processing community through being highly performant and able to take advantage of new computational hardware. This will be cloud enabled such that an engineer will be able to carry out these computations without needing to have a local supercomputer or computer cluster. Phase I will resulted in (1) a cloud approach to computation that presented a desktop interface to the engineer, while carrying out the computation on a remote cluster, (2) an implementation of GPU capable simulations for modeling plasma processing, (3) development of flexible GPU capability that allows the needed simulation to be set up through an input file, (4) prototyping plasma-wall interactions on GPUs. Phase II will build out this infrastructure, including development of GPU capable linear solvers, including an inductive solver, more and different kinds of particles, enhancing the set of collisions, including particle management such as splitting and recombining. Extensive efforts in code optimization will be undertaken. As well, the capability will be made available through public clouds, such as Amazon Web Services, and the new physics capabilities will become available through this cloud interface. The developed application will have use in the area of plasma simulation for microelectronics. Further, the capability would be made available on research clusters to benefit the plasma processing research community."

In particular, identification of applications for transuranic elements requires an understanding of their chemical behavior toward molecular transformations of relevance to the production of chemical fuels. With this overarching objective as our project motivation, our research group will develop novel scaffolds derived of wholly inorganic, metal-oxide assemblies. We anticipate that these molecular &ldquo;clusters&rdquo; will be capable of supporting novel reactivity at actinide ions, taking advantage of synergistic reactivity between transition-metal oxide moieties and the 5f-electron density unique to heavy elements. Indeed, we have opted to investigate early actinide elements (uranium, neptunium, plutonium) due to their tendency to exist in a variety of redox states, rendering multiple 5f-electrons accessible for chemical reactivity and bonding. Capitalizing on the enhanced stability of actinide-oxygen bonds, we propose that this ligand-design strategy will afford enhanced stability to the actinide ion through robust anionic, oxide linkages, enabling the actinide center to facilitate multielectron reactions of relevance to the production of chemical fuels. The impact of our research activities will be two-fold: (1) We will identify new chemical transformations for actinide elements that are enabled by combining the unique chemical behavior displayed of these elements with the well-established, rich electrochemical properties of molecular metal-oxide scaffolds; (2) The homogeneous properties of our actinide-functionalized metal-oxide structures will allow for thorough spectroscopic analysis of chemical reactions, ultimately providing opportunities to understand how electron density moves between substrate, actinide and metal-oxide metalloligand under relevant reaction conditions.

It will focus on two dimensional functional materials, but it is expected that the tools to be of general use beyond this class of materials. A key insight is that electron correlation plays a critical role in the materials physics of many functional materials but is a crucial weakness for widely-used computational tools such as density functional theory (DFT). By linking highly accurate and scalable Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to larger scale approaches, the project will develop new and widely accessible tools for materials design. HAMM will be developed in two main tracks: Track A will focus on generation of classical interatomic potentials from high-accuracy QMC results, and Track B on including electrons and electronic effects in effective models learned from training sets obtained from QMC. These two tracks are synergistic and can be combined to form combined electronic and interatomic models. The project will target application materials that have historically been challenging for multi-scale descriptions, such as strongly correlated systems and systems undergoing phase transformations. There has been a revolution in the capability to create new functional materials by layering van der Waals heterostructures, the so-called 2D materials. Examples include the emergent correlated phase in twisted bilayer graphene, two dimensional magnets enabled by spin-orbit coupling, defects that result in quantum emitters, and emergent topological states enabled by the marriage of topological materials with magnetism and superconductivity. A major challenge in this field is that there are many possible combinations; even only considering pure bilayers, the number of combinations scales quadratically with the number of materials. Add to that large number the possibility of controlled defects, multiple layers, and different relative orientation, and the possibilities expand dramatically. Thus there is a major need for rational materials design in this emerging sector. In addition, there are numerous experimental probes of surfaces allowing microscopic validation of the computational models. The focus will be on portable solutions to the objective of bridging the length and time scales, through open source libraries and well-documented data formats that form the glue between different computational scales and experiment. The project will develop algorithms and computational packages for computational efficiency and scaling to enable the transition from petascale to exascale computational resources and harness the full potential of DOE leadership computing facilities. Modern software development practices will be used, including distributed version control and automated testing for verification. The project will develop community-serving software that will link QMC at the first principles level to classical potentials, tight binding, and interacting lattice models at the higher length scale, focusing on 2D materials, including van der Waals interactions, strong correlations, defects, spin-orbit effects, magnetism, and metal-insulator transitions. This project will increase the availability of high accuracy reference data from QMC to the community, and enable validation of theories of these systems both with high accuracy methods and with experiment. It will also develop predictive models using this software that can be used for rational materials design of 2D materials at the mesoscale."
Direct Radiative Effects of Aerosols at the ARM SGP and TWP Sites,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020135,"Fu, Qiang",Qiang.Fu@universityofwashington,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","The most fundamental understanding of the role of natural and anthropogenic aerosols in the climate system starts with the knowledge of how they affect the Earth&rsquo;s radiative budget through scattering and absorption of solar radiation, i.e., the aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE). What are the aerosol DREs at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) and Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) sites based on the ARM measurements? Answering this question is hampered by the fact that the aerosol optical depth from, e.g., sun photometer measurements, is only available under clear-sky conditions even though aerosols directly modulate the radiative energy budget under cloudy conditions as well. While previous studies examined aerosol DREs at ARM sites under clear-sky conditions, no study to date has quantified aerosol DRE at ARM sites under all sky conditions using the ARM ground-based observational data. The objective of this proposed effort is to examine and quantify aerosol DREs and associated uncertainties at the SGP and TWP under all sky conditions by taking advantage of the advanced ARM long-term comprehensive measurements of aerosol, cloud, radiation, and atmospheric state. This effort will fill the knowledge gap in aerosol DREs at the SGP and TWP under all sky conditions based on the ARM observations. The ARM Raman lidar acquires high-quality measurements of aerosol and cloud vertical profiles, making it possible to quantify aerosol DREs under all sky conditions. In the proposed research, we will use the Raman lidar observations to divide observed atmospheric profiles at the SGP and TWP into three categories: clear-sky conditions, cloudy conditions transparent to Raman lidar, and cloudy conditions opaque to Raman lidar. The fractional occurrence of these three categories is 0.38 (0.13), 0.32 (0.50), and 0.30 (0.37), respectively, at the SGP (TWP). The aerosol DREs for these three categories will be quantified separately, then combined to obtain aerosol DREs under all sky conditions. The Raman lidar observations, supplemented with the Ka-band zenith radar (KAZR) and ground-based passive remote sensing and in-situ observations along with radiosonde data, will be used to characterize the aerosol and cloud properties and meteorological conditions. With these observational data as inputs, a radiative transfer model will be used to derive the aerosol DREs by performing simulations with and without aerosols. Compared with previous studies quantifying aerosol DRE in clear skies based on sun photometer measurements, the Raman lidar has the advantages of providing aerosol extinction profiles and that the derived aerosol optical depth will not be contaminated by thin cloud optical depth. For transparent cloudy conditions, the aerosol DREs can also be derived with high confidence, since the Raman lidar will provide the full vertical profiles of both aerosol and cloud extinction coefficients. For opaque cloud conditions, the aerosol extinction profiles below opaque clouds will still be available from the Raman lidar, and cloud property profiles will be derived from the KAZR. Above opaque clouds, where the aerosol profile is not available directly from Raman lidar, several approaches will be used to obtain the missing portions of the aerosol profiles. The observed surface broadband solar fluxes will be used to validate the radiation calculations through closure experiments, which, along with sensitivity studies and propagation of the errors in the input data, will be employed to quantify the uncertainty in derived aerosol DREs. Our proposed effort will directly support the Atmospheric System Research (ASR) goal of &ldquo;using observations to advance fundamental understanding of the cloud, aerosol, precipitation, and radiation processes across a range of scales key to improving the predictability of the Earth&rsquo;s radiative balance and hydrologic cycle.&rdquo; By focusing on aerosol DREs, the proposed effort is particularly relevant to this ASR Funding Opportunity Announcement's topic area of &ldquo;Aerosol processes at ARM sites,&rdquo; one of &ldquo;ASR&rsquo;s four priority research areas [that] correspond to atmospheric regimes with large uncertainties in earth system prediction.&rdquo; This study will lead to a quantification of aerosol DREs at ARM sites based on the best available observations, which is fundamentally important for improving our understanding of the interactions among aerosols, clouds, precipitation, and radiation, and for testing and validating regional and global model simulations and satellite observations."
Integrated Materials Platform for Topological Quantum Computing Devices,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019274,"Pribiag, Vlad",Vlad.Pribiag@regentsoftheuniversityofminnesota,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Integrated Materials Platforms for Topological Quantum Computing Devices Vlad Pribiag, University of Minnesota (Principal Investigator) Paul Crowell, University of Minnesota (Co-Investigator) Sergey Frolov, University of Pittsburgh (Co-Investigator) Noa Marom, Carnegie Mellon University (Co-Investigator) Chris Palmstrøm, University of California Santa Barbara (Co-Investigator) Topological excitations such as Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) provide unique pathways to fault-tolerant quantum computing, which can theoretically result in unsurpassed coherence times. Recent progress in this direction has been enabled by proximity effects between non-superconducting materials and superconductors; however, further breakthroughs leading to topological quantum computation require developing new material systems that integrate semiconductors not only with superconductors, but also with magnetic materials. Currently, MZM devices based on semiconductors require application of an external magnetic field to open a helical gap, necessary to realize an odd-parity topological superconductor. However, the presence of this field limits the robustness of topological properties by weakening the induced superconductivity. Moreover, the stringent requirements on its orientation with respect to the device greatly restrict the scalability of MZM-based quantum information systems. A promising path forward is to realize MZMs by closely integrating epitaxially-grown magnetic materials with semiconductors and superconductors. For example, as we have shown in the previous funding period, semiconductor nanowire structures with magnetic elements can enable ballistic and quantum-coherent transport of spin-polarized currents and can provide effective means to detect the helical gap and its spin texture. In addition, integrated magnetic structures can enable the manipulation of MZMs via local control of the magnetic degrees of freedom, greatly streamlining the scalability of topological quantum systems. More broadly, magnet-semiconductor-superconductor structures could host time-reversal-symmetry-broken and finite-momentum pairing superconducting phases. These phases can enable new types of qubits based on exotic superconductivity induced by the competition with magnetism in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. The experiments required to synthesize and fabricate high-quality interfaces and devices are costly and time consuming. Therefore, it is unfeasible to explore the space of possible structures and compositions by conventional experimental means alone. To this end, we propose an inter-disciplinary effort that combines materials synthesis with in-situ characterization and device fabrication, integrated with a computational approach based on lattice matching, genetic algorithm optimization, and machine learning. Experimental verification will be carried out for the most promising candidates identified by first-principles calculations. The proposed effort builds upon the computational and experimental methods we developed in the previous funding period, to scale up our materials discovery efforts and investigate new materials architectures. Lattice matching will be used for initial screening of a large number of candidate structures, with a focus on interfaces with Heusler compounds. We will also investigate interfaces involving tunnel barriers, to identify the optimal coupling to the semiconductor, an essential factor for achieving desired topological properties. We will leverage these novel one- and two-dimensional materials platforms to discover novel topological excitations and to demonstrate topological quantum systems with novel functionality. We expect that the proposed integrated approach will allow us to converge rapidly and systematically on robust topological states that will benefit from theoretically optimal materials properties, which cannot be realized by conventional fabrication and materials synthesis approaches. A central aim is to use these new materials platforms to demonstrate robust topological properties of MZMs modes. To this end, we will be looking for a fingerprint consisting of five key signatures, simultaneous observation of which would confirm the presence of MZMs with a high degree of confidence. Importantly, our approach will be compatible with scaling to form two-dimensional arrays of MZM qubits. Thus, the proposed work has the potential to greatly advance topologically-protected quantum information processing."
Nonequilibrium Phenomena in Plasmas in Contact with Liquids,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0018230,"Trelles, Juan",Juan.Trelles@universityofmassachusettslowell,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Plasmas in contact with liquids are found in diverse applications, both established (e.g. electric welding, metallurgy, confining walls of fusion reactors) and emerging (e.g. water treatment, nanoparticle synthesis, biomaterials and medicine). The advancement of these applications and, potentially, of unforeseen ones requires cohesive fundamental understanding of plasma-on-liquid interactions. These interactions present two distinct but interdependent types of nonequilibrium phenomena: (1) kinetic (microscopic, across the interface), involving complex multiphase physical and chemical kinetics; and (2) dissipative (macroscopic, along the interface), comprising superficial transport that is often conducive to instabilities and to the emergence of collective effects such as the spontaneous formation of spot patterns. Kinetic nonequilibrium is responsible for some of the remarkable characteristics of plasma processes such as high selectivity and energy efficiency. In contrast, dissipative nonequilibrium is often detrimental, limiting process uniformity and throughput. The project will establish a computational modeling and simulation method for the study of plasmas in contact with liquid electrodes. The method is based on a Heterogeneous Variational Multiscale approach that uses macroscale and microscale models consistently and complementarily: The macroscale model provides the backbone for the description of distributed fields, while the microscale model describes detailed kinetics locally. The approach is designed to achieve the high model fidelity and high numerical accuracy required to concurrently capture kinetic and dissipative nonequilibrium in application-relevant configurations. The method will be used to determine the parameters controlling stability and the emergence of collective behavior at the plasma-liquid interface and to characterize the role and interrelationship of these parameters with the rate of plasma-driven electrolysis."
Controlling Electron Transfer Pathways in Photosynthetic Reaction Centers,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0002036,"Kirmaier, Christine",Christine.Kirmaier@washingtonuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) convert light energy into chemical energy via a series of extremely efficient electron transfer (ET) reactions that accomplish transmembrane charge separation. RCs have two symmetry-related branches (or sets) of cofactors called A and B that are functionally asymmetric. In RCs from photosynthetic bacteria only the A-side cofactors are used for light-induced ET. Prior to this project, site-specific mutagenesis efforts had elicited B-branch activity but with only a very low (~10%) yield of charge separation across the RC. The overarching goal of this project is to engineer a bacterial RC that performs charge separation efficiently and exclusively via the B-side cofactors. Such an RC, and equally the steps toward it, will provide a fundamental understanding of how ET between the A-side cofactors is optimized and how ET between the B-side cofactors is prevented in the native system. This will afford not only detailed insight into RC function but also basic structure-function principles that govern efficient, multi-step, protein-mediated, light-induced ET. That knowledge will be broadly applicable, such as in aiding design of biomimetic systems that provide a long-lived charge-separated state that can be an energy source for downstream energy conversion and storage. In this project, protein-cofactor interactions, and thus the properties of the cofactors, in RCs from the purple photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter capsulatus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides are manipulated using a semi-directed molecular evolution approach. Saturation mutagenesis is employed to give all possible amino acid substitutions at a given site. In this way, productive substitutions can be found that would not have been chosen using the more standard site-directed approach (which is also utilized as needed). Saturation mutagenesis is typically performed in one or more template RCs that contain favorable mutations found previously in this project. The streamlined mutagenesis and RC isolation in the Laible lab at Argonne National Lab are coupled with time-resolved spectroscopic screening of the photochemistry (spanning 10 s) in the Kirmaier/Holten group at Washington University in St. Louis. Novel findings revealed for particular ET processes prompt more detailed studies to both understand the underlying ET mechanisms and use that knowledge to guide design of new RC motifs. RCs constructed in this project are also being employed in collaborative efforts. Ongoing studies with Dr. Jennifer Ogilvie (U. of Michigan) are probing the importance of coherence effects on primary charge separation on both the A and B sides of the RC. Architectural changes that accompany primary and secondary charge-separation events will be mapped with Dr. Jan Kern (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab) using time-resolved X-ray crystallography. A cryo-TEM structure of the core LH1/RC complex of R. capsulatus will be obtained with Dr. Karen Davies (Lawrence Berkeley National Lab). Comparison with the R. sphaeroides structure may help elucidate molecular origins of differences between A- and B-side ET rates and yields that have been observed in this project for RCs from the two strains. This research is central to DOE’s Basic Research Needs for Solar Energy Utilization report calling for efforts to (1) “adapt combinatorial, directed-evolution and high-throughput screening methods to enhance natural photosynthetic systems to increase the efficiency of solar fuels production,” and (2) “characterize structural and mechanistic features of natural photosynthetic complexes to identify desirable design motifs.” The research also directly addresses a focus area of DOE’s Photosynthetic Systems Program: “…studies of quantum-coherent energy transfers in natural photosynthesis could not only enhance fundamental understanding of energy transfer but may also inspire new approaches for controlling quantum phenomena, such as coherence, in complex molecular systems. Understanding the chemical mechanisms of natural photosynthesis can also guide genetic strategies for its improvement.”"

Because the core and the edge are governed by different physics, understanding how these regions interact and can be integrated represents an extraordinary challenge encompassing a wide range of spatial scales and a broad energy and temperature range. The limitation in reproducing reactor conditions in present experiments implies that most of current predictions of a reactor behavior have to rely on modeling. Radiative operation is considered essential for the operation of future fusion devices, and the achievement of core edge integration. As such, a deep physics understanding governing impurity transport and the development of tools to facilitate the achievement of a sustained regime with high radiation fraction has become a pressing issue in fusion research. The objective of this research is to tackle this challenge with a novel strategy which combines experimental activities, physical interpretation, and the development of a new tool for an integrated high fidelity modeling approach that will enable self-consistent impurity transport studies from the edge to the core. This will be applied to existing experiments for validation, and to inform and plan new experiments which will test the improved core-edge solutions identified through the validated modeling, thus ensuring the reliability of the integrated modeling also for predictions. Experiments designed to test modeling-driven, innovative solutions will open up important new directions for extrapolation and future predictions. This work will provide the scientific community with new modeling possibilities in the field of the integration between plasma core and edge and completely new and comprehensive possibilities in physics understanding of the complex physics processes which strongly impact the entire plasma behavior and the viability of present scenarios to reactor conditions."
Fundamental Mechanism for Flash Sintering of Highly Conductive High Temperature Ceramics,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022152,"Cheng, Zhe",Zhe.Cheng@floridainternationaluniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Fundamental Mechanism for Flash Sintering of Highly Conductive High Temperature Ceramics Zhe Cheng (PI), Andriy Durygin (co-PI), Vadym Drozd (co-PI) Florida International University (FIU), Miami, Florida Abstract High temperature ceramics (HTC) have strong bonding and high melting point, and they are generally difficult to sinter using conventional sintering techniques. On the other hand, over the past decade or so, flash sintering (FS) emerges as a relatively new sintering technique that can achieve rapid densification of ceramic materials, especially oxides (e.g., yttria-stabilized zirconia or YSZ), within ~1-2 minutes or even a few seconds. The research objective of this proposal is to investigate the fundamental mechanism for flash sintering of highly conductive HTC materials and reveal the interrelationships between those materials’ microstructure, defect and surface characteristics, transport properties, and their behaviors in flash sintering. To achieve this objective, technical approaches combining both experiments and theoretical calculations will be adopted. In particular, the detailed flash sintering behavior for highly conductive HTC materials (e.g., ZrN and ZrB2) will be studied including revealing the influence of processing parameters such as polarity, external pressure, sample preheating, starting relative density, and sintering aids. The samples’ microstructure, local composition, point defects, surface characteristics, as well as electrical properties at different stages in flash sintering including incubation at the beginning, the transient or the flash, and the subsequent steady state stage will be studied using different bulk and surface characterization techniques. In situ synchrotron study will be used to investigate the changes in HTC materials in real time during flash sintering, while their fundamental transport properties will be studied using stable isotope-labelled diffusion-couple experiments. For theoretical calculation, finite element modeling will be used for understanding the impacts of porosity/contact area and less conductive surface shell for the powder compacts at different stage of the flash sintering, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be used for revealing point defects generation and evolution and establishing the relationships between defects characteristics and the electrical/diffusion characteristics displayed in the flash sintering process."

Molecular inorganic complexes show significant promise as electrocatalysts for the selective reduction of carbon dioxide to useful chemical feedstocks and solar fuels. An outstanding challenge is incorporating these molecular catalysts into heterogeneous, multidimensional structures that reduce carbon dioxide with high activity and stability, but also maintain the selectivity of discrete, molecular catalysts. The objective of this research is to determine how the complicated and interrelated effects of charge delocalization, intramolecular electrostatics, and electronic coupling influence catalytic activity and selectivity in extended multidimensional catalyst architectures. The specific research approach uses a combination of electroanalytical and spectroelectrochemical measurements to probe the relative influence of these effects on catalytic performance as the catalyst structures increase in complexity from discrete molecular catalysts, to multimetallic molecular assemblies, and finally to extended 1D and 2D catalyst structures. The results of this research will provide a template for the rational design of new multidimensional catalyst materials, comprised of molecular catalyst building units, for the efficient and selective electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to value-added products."

The plasma-facing surfaces of a demonstration fusion reactor will be simultaneously bombarded with high-flux deuterium and tritium plasma species, impurities, and fusion products. Deciphering the effects of these exposure conditions on the surface presents a daunting challenge, and, as a result, the physics governing many aspects of how surfaces are modified by the plasma is poorly understood at a fundamental level. This has impeded the ability to predict how advanced materials perform in a fusion environment. Moreover, degradation of the plasma-facing surfaces is closely coupled with many other aspects of reactor operation. For example, species sputtered from the plasma-facing materials are a major source of impurities in the core plasma. Furthermore, implanted tritium from the plasma implants in the wall material, diffuses within it, and eventually either recycles into the plasma or becomes trapped within the walls of the reactor, creating a significant radiological hazard. Given the technical challenges, plasma material interactions and materials development are recognized as top priorities in the fusion energy research community. In order to guide the development of performance improvements in existing materials and the discovery of completely new materials for use at SC-supported user facilities such as DIII-D, NSTX-U and eventually the materials plasma exposure experiment (MPEX) and ITER, advances in existing computational approaches are needed. In particular, robust accurate atomistic materials simulation methods are needed for predictive simulations of hydrogen retention in first wall material. Proposed Work: Atomistic simulation using ab initio quantum electronic structure methods or classical molecular dynamics (MD) provides unique insight into the interaction of hydrogen with microstructural features and impurities. The ab initio methods, while very accurate, are limited to structures with hundreds of atoms, too small for representing complex microstructures, except in highly idealized cases. Classical molecular dynamics codes, such as Sandia's LAMMPS software, running on large HPC computers can access very large length and timescales, but the predictive power of these simulations is severely limited by the accuracy of the interatomic potential (IAP) used to calculate atom forces. The recent emergence of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIAP) enables the possibility of achieving the accuracy of ab initio without the high cost. However, the accuracy of an MLIAP for a particular application is difficult to characterize, depending in unpredictable ways on the overlap between the training data and the atomic environments encountered in the application. The goal of this project is to use machine learning, data science, uncertainty quantification methods, and massive training data sets to automate the search for optimal MLIAPs. The very large space of descriptors and energy models will be efficiently explored, systematically reducing quantified uncertainty on predictions of targeted quantities of interest, such as retention of hydrogen in the tungsten divertor material in the presence of both designed and plasma-driven microstructural features and impurities. This is an important application that has so far been beyond the reach of atomistic simulation. The project will apply machine-learning methods and high-performance computing to advance the state-of-the-art in atomistic materials modeling of plasma-surface interactions in fusion reactors, connecting ab initio calculations, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental characterization to impact fusion energy research. This capability will be integrated into a flexible multiscale workflow and made available to the broader research community. The team includes experts in plasma-surface interactions, interatomic potentials, data science, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification. If successful, this work will impact not only fusion energy materials research, but also many other areas of materials discovery."

MUED takes advantage of the strong interaction between electrons and matter and minimizes space charge problems seen in other low-energy electron diffraction systems. An MUED instrument can resolve much finer structural details enabling us to see how atoms in molecules move and can make molecular movies of ultrafast chemical reactions by utilizing a pump-probe technique. While a few facilities have been constructed to provide these advanced capabilities to a growing user community, as a relatively young technology, progress is ongoing and much remains to be learned by improving these facilities, especially in maximizing throughput and ease of operation (e.g. rapid initialization and high stability). One class of advancement that can be immediately investigated at MUED facilities is the demonstration of realtime or near-realtime data processing enabled by data science/machine learning/artificial intelligence mechanisms in conjunctions with high-performance computing (HPC) to bring automated operation, data acquisition and processing to the facility control and experiment analysis, thereby enabling faster measurement throughout. For example, applying deep learning to MUED diffraction patterns generated through instrument probing of materials systems is an innovative step to turn-key, high throughput and high research output instruments. Such an approach has been demonstrated with success when applied to X-ray diffraction and many other experiments, and there is high confidence that significant gains are possible for MUED facilities. The goals for this research project are to utilize the expertise of the PIs’ collaboration at DOE labs to identify the most promising machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, as well as others used in the accelerator and facility user communities, apply and optimize them for improved operation of the Brookhaven National Laboratory Accelerator Test Facility MUED instrument in conjunction with enhanced computer interfacing and diagnostic capability of the machine, conduct online ML-control to provide the users the ideal beam with high stability for specific material types, provide experimenters with greatly improved usability and sample throughput, and consequently demonstrate increased scientific productivity of MUED facilities. The team will do this in seamless conjunction with a second user facility, the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF). Scientific advancement will be enabled in a wide range of fields including accelerator science, materials science, ML control, and in AI for science with HPCs. Some of the materials science focuses the PIs are considering during the validation phase are on materials applied in diverse uses such as superconductors, battery and fuel cell components, high strength magnets, thermoelectrics, and quantum information storage and manipulation. MUED (and its cousin technique MEU Microscopy) is also emerging for interesting biomolecules. Of particular interest is the study of proteases that mediate diverse disease processes such as viral entry into cells (e.g. COVID-19) and cancer metastasis. This research will open the door to new collaborations between the UNM and LANL team members and an Office of Science User Facility at Brookhaven – the Accelerator Test Facility – that will enable high-throughput research with materials through the use of data science, ML and AI. Additionally, the UNM and LANL team members, as well as the BNL team members will have access to the ALCF. Finally, the Argonne team members will be interfacing their facility with the new genre of user facility (MUED) at BNL for new explorations in AI for science."

The continued safe operation and utility of a fusion energy device will, in part, rely on the structural integrity of the steel-manufactured components used within its design. These components could see unique operating conditions, including a damaging flux of high-energy neutrons that can alter their structure and chemistry. The neutron flux creates both atomic displacements and transmutation products such as helium in the steels. The aim of this research is to understand how various regimes of the neutron flux will impact the response of advanced steels with innovative nanometric precipitates additions formed intrinsically during manufacturing within its matrix. Specifically, the influence of the precipitate-matrix stability under a damaging energetic particle flux on the helium migration, coalescence, and trapping will be evaluated. The approach will use both ex situ and in situ dual beam ion irradiations to experimentally simulate the various neutron damage and transmutation conditions in a model advanced steel developed using computational thermodynamics and printed using additive manufacturing. Post irradiation, the changes in structure and chemistry will be assessed using an extensive characterization campaign using electron-microscopy based techniques. The experimental efforts will be coupled with advanced computer analysis algorithms and theoretical models to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that control precipitate stability and helium trapping in advanced steels. The work will provide the additional fundamental insights needed to further optimize the design and manufacturing of advanced steels for fusion energy systems."

It is well known that Nature accomplishes selective reactions and effective separations with exquisite control, particularly in the presence of water. Many natural enzymatic processes occur at the lipid-water interface and control their selectivity and subsequent separation by hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions. These hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions can also be altered by external stimuli, which makes these environments adaptable to the required functions. Therefore, the specific objectives of this research are the nano-fabrication, characterization, testing under reaction conditions, and theoretical modeling of the solid/liquid interface in aqueous and biphasic systems surrounding functionalized solid surfaces. Specifically, the promoting role of water for enhancing reaction activity and selectivity is investigated. An integrated experimental, theoretical and computational research is necessary to provide atomic-level insight on reactions occurring at the complex, dynamic solid/liquid interface.

Gloria Coruzzi, New York University (Principal Investigator) Rodrigo Gutierrez, P. Universidad Catolica de Chile (Co-Investigator) Dennis Stevenson, New York Botanical Garden (Co-Investigator) Robert DeSalle, American Museum of Natural History (Co-Investigator) W. Richard McCombie, Cold Spring Harbor Labs (Co-Investigator) Jean-Michel Ane & Heidi Kaeppler, UW-Madison (Co-Investigators) This collaborative project exploits the genomes of “extreme survivor” plants adapted to thrive in marginal, extremely nitrogen (N) poor soils in the arid Chilean Andes. It uses a previously validated phylogenomic approach and a “paired species” sampling strategy, to identify the genes that distinguish these “extreme survivors” in Chile from their related species adapted to similarly dry regions in California (CA) that are not constrained by N. The Chile and California species pairings were chosen as these two regions are in same “floristic province”, comprising two of the six Mediterranean provinces world-wide. These “extreme survivor” species cover the main branches in flowering plants, and include 7 grass species that are of particular interest for biofuels and a focus of our validation studies. Key to our phylogenomic approach is the “paired species” sampling strategy. This will identify the genes responsible for the divergence of the “extreme survivors” adapted to the marginal low-N soils of Chile, from their most closely related species growing on arid but N-replete soils in CA. To maximize our ability to separate the trait-relevant signature from overall speciation events, our “paired species” sampling will cover multiple independent origins of the low-N adaptive trait. Importantly, RNA-seq data has already been obtained for 63 “extreme survivor” species growing in the marginal low-N soils in Chile of which we focus on 24 species that are relevant to potential biofuel species. Thus, DOE plant collections and sequencing efforts will be on the 24 sister species in CA. In published studies, we validated this phylogenomic approach, and showed that it could; i) identify genes that underlie convergent evolution of antioxidant synthesis in Rosids in a study of 150 genomes; and ii) identify 100+ genes associated with the loss of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis in the Brassicaceae. In preliminary phylogenomic studies on this EvoNet project, we identified 145 recurrent genes that support the divergence of “extreme survivors” from their non-adapted species across 5 species pairs. We anticipate that the adaptation to low-N environments will capture one or more of the following: physiological and/or developmental adaptations that allow efficient capture and/or assimilation and/or remobilization of N in N-poor soils, a prediction supported by our preliminary studies. Prioritized genes will be validated in models including Brachypodium and Arabidopsis in experiments that measure nitrogen use efficiency. We apply this approach in the following four aims: Aim 1. Paired-species collection and sequencing: We will use a “paired-sampling” strategy to capture genes involved in adaptations of “extreme survivors” which grow on dry, N-poor soils (Chile) compared to their “paired species” from California adapted only to drought across 24 species pairs. Aim 2. Phylogenomic and Network Analysis: We will (A) perform phylogenomic analysis of the “extreme survivors” in a “paired-sampling” strategy to identify genes supporting evolution of adaptations to marginal, low-N soils, and (B) perform network analysis based on gene expression and interactions. Aim 3. Integrating Phylogenomic and Network signatures: We will systematically combine phylogenomic signals and gene networks to prioritize candidate genes associated with adaptations to marginal, low-N soils for testing. Aim 4. Functional validation of candidate genes: We will functionally validate top-ranked candidate genes for low-N adaptation in the model plants Arabidopsis (a model dicot) and Brachypodium (a model grass). Outcomes: This project benefits from the highly interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in systematics, phylogenetics, genomics and biotechnology and an established history of successful collaborations who will train students & post-docs in phylogenomics and gene networks. The genes and network modules we uncover in our collaborative study have the potential of translation to biofuel crops to greatly increase their biomass and nitrogen use efficiency in marginal low fertility soils."
From Wave Functions to Exchange Correlation for Large-Scale Electronic Structure,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022241,"Zimmerman, Paul",Paul.Zimmerman@regentsoftheuniversityofmichigan,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Electronic structure methods have the power to predict all kinds of materials properties and form a basis for computational materials design. One factor that holds these techniques back is the limited availability of methods that are simultaneously accurate and practically useful for large materials systems. In particular, two mainstay strategies for electronic structure—wave function and density functional theories (WFT and DFT)—have differing limits to their applicability: WFT is accurate but applicable mostly to small models, and DFT is less accurate but does scale well for large systems. To help overcome these limitations, this proposal includes strategies to increase the scalability of highly accurate WFT and use WFT results to build more accurate DFT methods. Towards achieving these goals, strategies for graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated WFT and DFT are introduced. By exploiting multi-node, multi-GPU parallelization the high workloads of WFT and DFT will be distributed across modern supercomputers to reach larger system sizes than previously possible. These advances will require the new algorithmic strategies and code implementations that will be pursued as part of this work. To provide a step function increase in DFT accuracy, this proposal will use novel strategies to determine the quantum mechanical component of DFT, the exchange-correlation potential. By leveraging accurate electron densities from WFT to determine exchange-correlation potentials, the proposed approach is expected to increase the accuracy of DFT by using these potentials to train exchange-correlation functionals. The new functionals will be developed by data-driven functional optimization—including use of machine learning through deep neural networks—which will allow us to approach the goal of achieving WFT-like accuracy in DFT. Beyond the internal goals of this project, the wider chemical and materials communities will benefit from the proposed activities. First, the codes created in this project will be designed to be modular, allowing others to take pieces of the work for use in their own research. Next, the exchange-correlation potential is a core concept in DFT, but most DFT functionals are not trained using it due to lack of availability. Therefore, our planned release of a library of exchange-correlation potentials will aid the DFT community by providing developers with a databank of this important quantity for training their own functionals. Finally, release of new DFT functionals and a scalable, near-exact WFT for general use will provide computational scientists with new means for accurate first principles simulations. Application of the proposed methods to ion transport in Li ion batteries will give a demonstration of how the tools can be usefully applied to strongly correlated materials with large numbers of electrons."

This class of materials has shown potential for various optoelectronic applications and, in particular, can serve as light emitters in the near-infrared (NIR) region that can be used for night vision and deep tissue penetration. However, most of current metal-organic light emitters use precious metals such as platinum, ruthenium, and iridium, which are expensive and limited in natural supplies. This project proposes to achieve highly efficient NIR emission from the long-lived triplet excited state important for night-vision and telecommunication devices, optical sensing, photocatalysis, and bioimaging using new metal-organic complexes involving earth abundant metals: copper (Cu), tungsten (W), and molybdenum (Mo). A rational design of the metal-organic complexes with improved emission properties is challenging because the relationship between the geometrical structure and emission features is not fully understood. To optimize the emission characteristics, numerous possibilities of ligand combinations should be checked, which is a great challenge for conventional experimental approaches. Instead of tedious experimental studies to figure out the best ligand combinations, this project aims to develop methodology that combines experimental data and computational results with data-driven analysis based on machine learning (ML) and cheminformatic models. This approach will elucidate structural factors responsible for NIR emission in these earth-abundant metal-organic complexes (AMCs). The predicted criteria will be used to guide the design of novel NIR-active AMCs with Cu, Mo, and W metals. The proposed methodology is based on the self-iterative feedback loop between the results from experiments, computations, and ML-models that will be iteratively improved on-the-fly with new data generated during the project. The experiment/computation/ML-model combination is capable of detecting hidden structure-property correlations in these complexes that are not visible in conventional computational or experimental analyses. This approach helps not only predicting the best candidates for NIR emission, but also reducing the number of features that researchers should focus on and investigate deeply in one-by-one studies. Since ML modeling helps reducing a large information space (thousands of features) to a small set of 5-10 key-features responsible for optimal optical response, this approach will significantly speed up a rational design of novel NIR-emitting AMCs with desired optical properties. The objectives of this project include (1) collection and systematization of available data from in-house and public sources; (2) synthesis and investigation of AMCs using experimental and computational characterization of chemical structures and photophysical properties and conversion of these parameters into inputs for ML models; (3) generation of virtual libraries of hypothetical NIR-emitting AMCs for candidate screening and rational design using ML/cheminformatics methods; and (4) prediction and validation of structure-property relationships and using them as guidelines for developing novel AMCs with desired NIR emission. The outcomes of this project include (1) establishing the structure-property correlations through navigating the AMC structures and analyzing/modeling their structural and electronic characteristics with respect to optical properties; (2) developing new predictive ML models to forecast photophysics and assist de novo design of novel NIR-emitting AMCs; (3) creating a publicly accessible electronic database containing all screened AMCs, and disseminating the set of scripts and programs developed for cooperative experiment/computation/ML-model methods to the scientific community via website; and (4) responding to the DOE FOA Objectives and Federal Strategy on enabling discovery and design of alternates to critical materials focused on rare earth and platinum group elements to reduce or eliminate their need in technological applications."
From tides to seasons: How cyclic tidal drivers and plant physiology interact to affect carbon cycling at the terrestrial-estuarine boundary,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022108,"Forbrich, Inke",Inke.Forbrich@marinebiologicallaboratory,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Coastal ecosystems are among the most biologically and biogeochemically active and diverse systems on Earth. Because they act as important linkages between terrestrial ecosystems and the open ocean, their incorporation in Earth system models (ESMs) is critical to predict coastal and global responses to environmental changes. However, they vary greatly in the magnitude of tides and the volume and timing of freshwater input from land, making it challenging to model the major biogeochemical reactions that control productivity and greenhouse gas emissions across coastal terrestrial aquatic interfaces (TAIs). Key characteristics that distinguish coastal wetlands, such as tidal oscillation, sulfur biogeochemistry, and plant structural adaptations to anaerobic soil, have only very recently been incorporated in land surface models such as ELM-PFLOTRAN. There remains large uncertainty in their parameterization. Particularly challenging are: 1) the small-scale, dynamic, heterogeneous redox conditions in wetland soils; 2) the aerenchyma tissue in wetland plants that greatly facilitate gas flow into and out of sediment; and 3) the temporal and spatial variability in salinity, which is a key determinant for plant species distribution and productivity, as well as organic matter decomposition. Our overarching goal is to improve mechanistic process understanding and modeling of tidal wetland hydro-biogeochemistry in coastal TAIs. Working in brackish marsh, we will combine intensive and new spatially-explicit sediment redox measurements with continuous sediment redox, salinity, and water table data, testing relationships between these sediment data and eddy covariance measurements of carbon and energy exchange. Measurements will be guided by, and will inform, new developments in ELM-PFLOTRAN designed to capture critical features of diverse coastal TAI functions. Three questions, spanning small to ecosystem scales, and short to long-term drivers, guide our approach: 1. How do tidal water level oscillations, evapotranspiration-driven water level changes, and oxygen (O2) transport from roots into the rhizosphere control tidal marsh redox and sediment oxygen distribution? 2. How do hydrology, biogeochemistry and plant biology interact on different timescales to influence energy and greenhouse gas fluxes? 3. How will carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas fluxes respond to changes in climate and sea level? We will test six hypotheses within the framework of these three questions. We plan integrated measurements and modeling at two locations with contrasting hydro-biogeochemistry in an oligohaline marsh in the Parker River estuary, MA. The estuary is the largest remaining tidal wetland complex in the northeastern United States. Research at this location will be synergistic with ongoing efforts by our modeling team at the Global Change Research Wetland GCReW. We will use field measurements to help constrain three phases of ELM-PFLOTRAN development designed to improve simulations of brackish marsh biogeochemistry under fluctuating oxygen availability and salinity influenced by tides, diel and seasonal changes in plant physiology and river discharge. Ultimately, we will be poised to combine our new process understanding and model formulation with existing long-term data already in hand from two more saline salt marsh sites in the Parker Estuary. As sea level rises, saline conditions will become more common in many coastal TAIs, but they will also potentially be exposed to more flashy freshwater riverine input from intense, sporadic, storms. By having information from marshes at both ends of the full salinity gradient, we will be able to better constrain biogeochemical reactions in ELM-PFLOTRAN, validate ecosystem-scale modeled fluxes with eddy covariance measurements, and simulate present and future hydrological variations and resulting carbon dioxide and methane fluxes in tidal wetlands in the face of expected global change."
Linking Nutrient Reactivity and Transport in Subsurface Flowpaths Along a Terrestrial-Estuarine Continuum,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021044,"Zimmer, Margaret",Margaret.Zimmer@theregentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Salt marshes are critical “hot spots” of nutrient processing and retention and thus play an important role in improving coastal water quality. In particular, coastal salt marshes retain upwards of one-third of terrestrially derived nitrogen (N) loads, helping to mitigate negative environmental impacts such as eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. This removal is largely driven by sediment microbial activity, which is controlled by spatial and temporal variability in the availability in oxygen and organic matter. These changes in redox characteristics and substrate availability impact the pathways by which N is processed by microbes. Our study objective is to address a substantial knowledge gap in our understanding of the hydrologic and environmental factors that drive solute fate and transport at the subsurface terrestrial-marine boundary at tidal watershed mouths. At the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve, we will couple field- and lab-based studies with reactive transport models to quantify the co-variation of hydrological and biogeochemical subsurface processes in coastal watersheds, with a particular emphasis on identifying drivers on N retention and removal over different hydrologic regimes. Through this effort, we are extending the DOE Scientific Focus Area testbed approach to a novel and underrepresented coastal ecosystem."
Probing Ianmodulin's Mechanisms of Rare-Earth Selectivity for Protein-Based Bioseparations,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021007,"Cotruvo, Joseph",Joseph.Cotruvo@thepennsylvaniastateuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","This project addresses the challenge of separating rare earth elements (REEs) from one another and from other ions, using Nature’s solutions to this problem as guides. REEs are ubiquitous components of current technologies from permanent magnets and lasers to medical imaging agents. Separations of REEs from more abundant metals and from each other in mining and recycling applications is currently a laborious, energy- and resource-intensive process using relatively low-selectivity ligands. Increasing efficiency of these separations has the potential to lower costs, decrease waste, and allow usage of feedstocks with lower REE concentrations. The recent discovery and characterization of lanmodulin (LanM), a highly selective REE-binding protein, forms the basis of this research. LanM has an intriguing framework in which to understand the fundamentals of the biological coordination chemistry of lanthanide ions; preliminary data also indicate that it is a protein with remarkable stability properties that enable it to quantitatively extract total REEs from industrially relevant feedstocks even under harsh experimental conditions. Although LanM displays exceedingly high selectivity for REEs versus non-REEs, its selectivity within the REEs is rather low. The present research program will utilize a multidisciplinary approach to develop LanM variants with higher intra-REE selectivities for REE separations. Whereas small molecules, materials, and whole cells have been explored for separations, effective macromolecular approaches are conspicuously absent. The promising performance, stability, affinity, and selectivity of LanM suggest that this protein and its derivatives may serve as guides for new and efficient approaches to REE separations."
Towards the Mechanism of N2 Fixation by Nitrogenase,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019342,"Hoffman, Brian",Brian.Hoffman@northwesternuniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Nitrogenase, which is found in select bacteria and archaea, catalyzes ‘nitrogen fixation’, the multi-electron, multi-proton reduction of dinitrogen (N=N) to two ammonia (NH3) molecules under atmospheric pressure and room temperature. The ammonia produced by this enzyme supports half the earth’s human population. In addition to the physiological substrate, N2, nitrogenase also can reduce small carbon-based molecules, such as acetylene (HC=CH), CO, and CO2. In particular, both wild type and remodeled Mo-nitrogenase can reduce CO2 to formate (HCOO-), methane (CH4), and to longer chain hydrocarbons (C2-C4). Thus, nitrogenase is a single catalyst that can accomplish reduction of both N2 and CO/CO2 under ambient conditions, offering an ideal system both to deduce underlying catalytic principles and to explore alternative means of producing ammonia as fertilizer and hydrocarbons as fuels. Possibilities are broadened by the existence of two ‘alternative’ nitrogenases, with differing properties and capabilities in addition to the dominant ‘molybdenum-nitrogenase’. We seek a more complete picture of the molecular mechanisms for multi-e-/H+ substrate reductions by the nitrogenase enzymes, in particular of carbon-based substrates. This effort begins with a foundational determination of the mechanism of reduction of the paradigmatic substrate C2H2, on which we will build studies of CO and CO2 reduction. The studies involve characterization of the enzymology of these reactions through kinetic analyses and product determination as augmented by mass spectroscopic measurements. In parallel, we will characterize intermediates trapped during enzymatic turnover, in particular intermediates formed in novel nitrogenase constructs generated by DOE-funded collaborators. These efforts involve the application of advanced electron paramagnetic resonance methodologies, especially electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), as augmented by photophysical approaches."

Together, they control permeability, influence recovery rates of water, energy and fuels and impact the longevity of waste isolation. In our current work, we have developed experimental and analytical methods to study the evolution of flow and elastodynamic properties in fractured rocks undergoing shear and effective stress perturbations. Here, we propose to leverage the cross-disciplinary collaboration that we have developed under the current project and expand on the successful techniques generated in the past few years. Our goals include understanding the fundamental mechanisms that govern fluid flow, friction, and elastic properties of fractured rock. Specifically, we will conduct experiments to: (I) decouple the influence of fracture aperture distribution and roughness from unclogging on the elastic and flow properties, explore these behaviors for (II) shear-reactivation of fractures, and develop complex analyses that: (III) assimilate these data, illuminate key mechanistic feedbacks and address upscaling of our results to field scale. The work we propose addresses societally-relevant issues such as induced seismicity, probes frontier scientific problems related to nonlinear elasticity and the coupling between transport and elastodynamic properties and utilizes machine learning techniques to maximally illuminate correlations from the mechanism-rich geophysical data. Our proposed plan includes unusually well-controlled lab experiments to measure friction and flow. We will use new techniques including synchrotron X-ray computed tomography of fracture properties and will combine time-dependent microstructural and ultrasonic imaging of fractures under dynamic stressing to probe causative mechanisms linking permeability and stiffness. The primary elements of our proposed work include: 1) active and passive ultrasonic measurements to determine the elastodynamic response of fractured samples and simulated faults, 2) permeability studies of fractured samples subject to elastic loading and inelastic deformation, 3) measurement of friction constitutive properties under steady state shear and during stick-slip sliding, and 4) physics-based and data-driven modeling to predict hydraulic properties and controls on induced seismicity. The laboratory program will include a subset of simple tests with isolated measurement of one variable, but the majority of our work will focus on coupled processes as revealed by simultaneous monitoring of the evolution of elastodynamic properties, permeability, and friction constitutive behavior during elastic loading and inelastic deformation. We will follow a systematic approach by studying both intact rock and comparing it to well-characterized fractures (with and without infilling) under a range of stress and saturation conditions. The role of microstructure and shear fabric will be illuminated by our laboratory data and also by studies that involve synchrotron X-ray imaging."
Transient and Metastable Order Created by Ultrafast Light,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0012375,"Gopalan, Venkatraman",Venkatraman.Gopalan@thepennsylvaniastateuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","A grand challenge of ultrafast science is to illuminate a material with ultrafast electromagnetic fields to realize emergent non-equilibrium states exhibiting exciting properties achieved without any change in the chemical composition. Our goal is to create and study novel emergent states that cannot, in a given material, be realized in equilibrium and exhibit order over hundreds of unit cells while surviving for long times (ultimately, until erased). To date, the quest for light-based dynamics and control of condensed matter typically involves “melting” of order, followed by its re-emergence on fs-ns timescales. In a limited number of cases ultrafast light has been found to create transient (short-lived) order including superconductivity, charge-density waves, topological states in a Weyl semimetal, and transient light induced anomalous Hall effect. Also, in a very few cases ultrafast light creates metastable order: an example from this team is the optical creation of a polar supercrystal in titanate heterostructures. It is natural to ask how one can achieve such light-created states with long range order in a systematic, predictive, and thus abundant manner. Our approach to optically creating order that extends over tens of nanometers or longer is to create atomic-scale superlattices and Moir heterostructures that frustrate short-range local interactions while introducing or increasing the influence of long-range interactions. We propose an integrated theory and experimental program to develop new ways to create and observe metastable and transient states of matter using ultrafast excitation towards creating and probing metastable order. The goal is to trigger extended order (with 10’s of nanometers periodicity) by applying ultrafast light to superlattice structures and Moiré-like materials tuned to the verge of criticality to initiate emergent order. We will consider frustrated states with novel quasiparticle excitations or, at the other extreme, highly ordered long-range structures such as supercrystals, vortices, and skyrmions. Our proposal is based on five years of interdisciplinary teamwork under grant DE-SC0012375. The team is comprised of experts in X-ray science at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), Advanced Photon Source (APS), and ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) at SLAC (Freeland, Lindenberg, Wen), ultrafast optical spectroscopy and microscopy (Gopalan, Wen), thin-film growth expert (Martin), and leaders in phase-field modeling (Chen). We were recently awarded a highly-competitive LCLS Campaign proposal which provides a guaranteed series of beamtimes at LCLS for the next two years. The science proposed in our Campaign will be supported by this renewal grant. The team also actively uses APS, ALS, CHESS, SACLA, PAL, and European XFEL x-ray facilities. The proposed work will lead to advances in the field of non-equilibrium science and techniques to be disseminated broadly, and provide opportunities for students to be trained in a highly interdisciplinary research environment."

Estroff, Cornell University (Principal Investigator) U.B. Wiesner, Cornell University (co-Principal Investigator) Based on the successes of the last funding period, and inspired by biological systems, the current project focuses on the fundamental understanding of how, in a synthetic bottom-up approach, organic molecule self-assembly leads to structure control of inorganic materials at different length scales, from the nanoscopic all the way to the macroscopic scale. The emphasis is on elucidation of previously inaccessible structures that promise a range of novel properties with implications for a number of fields, including sensing, energy conversion, and energy storage. On the organic side we will look at surfactant self-assembly as well as at macromolecular (block copolymer) self-assembly as structure-directing mechanisms, while on the inorganic side we will cover the formation of amorphous glasses as well as poly- and single-crystalline solids. In all cases, we are interested in elucidating early formation stages of structure formation processes in order to better understand how information on the organic side is transferred via interfaces to the emerging structure control on the inorganic side. Another focus is to map out the pathway complexity which is inherent in multicomponent synthesis systems, i.e.the ability to change the outcome of synthesis efforts based on often small changes in the synthesis control parameters. In this project we will make use of significant recent advances in synthesis protocols as well as characterization techniques to provide new insights not achievable before. These techniques include the use of cryo-EM images and single-particle reconstruction algorithms originally developed for structural biology to elucidate never-before-seen ultrasmall silica cage structures in synthetic materials discovery, the ability, for the first time, to grow macroscopic co-continuous gyroidal mesoporous single crystals for use as templates for atomically crystalline solids, as well as the use of state-of-the-art multiplexed optical super-resolution microscopy probes and techniques in combination with in-situAFM in order to capture details of the crystal growth around nanoparticulate inclusions. The three synthetic model systems are geared toward the development of a synthesis science focused on the formation of organic-inorganic hybrid nanomaterials, in which hierarchical architectures mimic structural elements observed in natural biological systems that enable a set of unique, e.g.optical, mechanical, or electrical properties. This project is a collaborative effort between the groups of Lara Estroff and Uli Wiesner, both at the Materials Science and Engineering Department of Cornell University. This collaboration brings together unique expertise in evaluating the mechanisms of crystal growth as well as insights into the synthesis and characterization of complex/mesostructured crystals (Estroff) with considerable know-how in the area of block copolymer self-assembly directed inorganic materials, as well as in the sol-gel chemistry of silica, in particular in the area of silica nanoparticles (Wiesner). The PIs have access to world-class facilities at Cornell enabling the project, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-EM facilities of the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR), Cornell’s High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) with unique facilities for small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), as well as the Cornell NanoScale Science and Technology Facility (CNF), which houses instruments for sample processing (e.g.atomic layer deposition, ALD) and characterization (e.g. scanning electron microscopy)."
Encoding Material Structure Into the Primary Sequence of Polymers,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0007106,"Olsen, Bradley",Bradley.Olsen@massachusettsinstituteoftechnology,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","One of the largest research challenges in soft materials is using chemistry to design molecules where the arrangement of atoms encodes for the formation of exquisite, hierarchically structured materials that can approach the complex and highly functional systems made in biology, variants of which have been identified in several key DOE-BES reports as priority research directions. The problem of encoding material structure using primary sequence for linear chains requires the ability to construct a polymer with a given property function, f(s), where s is the path length variable along the backbone of the polymer chain and f is a vector of relevant properties along the length of the chain such as hydrophobicity, polarity, presence of specific hydrogen bonding groups, charge, or aromatic groups. Second, one must learn the translation function by which a chain with a given f(s) forms a specific nanostructure, such that one can solve the problem of designing an f(s) in order to achieve the target structure. This problem has been approached with great success for several decades using relatively simple f(s); for example, step functions characterize diblock copolymers and monotonically increasing or decreasing curves characterize gradient or tapered copolymers. There is potential for further transformative advance if we could design polymers with arbitrary f(s) because it would enable us to potentially discover new phases and material structures and to more carefully encode the free energy surface and consequently non-equilibrium behavior of the material in a way that could enable us to exquisitely tune the phase formed based on the processing pathway utilized. Synthesis of an arbitrary f(s) is easily achieved today using biological synthesis of elastin-like proteins (ELPs), enabling the preparation of long macromolecules in comparatively high yield. In this proposal, we will therefore exploit biological sequence-controlled polymerization as a well-established tool to specifically encode material structure and free energy surfaces, developing new paradigms for designing equilibrium and far from equilibrium structures. To enable these scientific developments, we will also develop new methods of experimentation and data analysis, particularly related to the use of neutron scattering techniques, that facilitate the characterization of equilibrium and non-equilibrium structure and the dynamics of these materials. The approach to this grand challenge will be broken into three tasks. First, the monomer encoding of chain properties (i.e. hydrophobicity) will be studied as a function of cononsolvent concentration and salinity in aqueous solutions, providing a group contribution basis for design of chain sequences. Sequences will then be designed to encode for micelles with novel structural transitions due to specific changes in their properties along the chain as solution conditions change. Second, we will develop an inverse design strategy for predicting the type of nanostructure formed as a function of polymer chain sequence, and we will use these simulations to design chain sequences that encode polymer nanostructures never before reported. ELPs will then be synthesized that encode these predicted sequences and their self-assembly and processing pathways will be explored with the aim of achieving these new nanostructures via a rational design process. Finally, we will encode into polymer chains specific additional interactions that allow us to effectively expand the dimensionality of their thermodynamic space, producing processing pathways that move around kinetic barriers to enable exquisite control over non-equilibrium structure formation. In particular, we will develop two methods, local kinetic arrest and polymer folding, as forms of reversible chain reconfiguration."
Quantitative Studies of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0005042,"Jain, Jainendra",Jainendra.Jain@thepennsylvaniastateuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Quantitative Studies of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect Jainendra Jain, The Pennsylvania State University (Principal Investigator) The study of two-dimensional electrons in semiconductor quantum wells, single and bilayer graphene, twisted bilayer graphene, and transition-metal dichalcogenides has inspired exciting discoveries in condensed matter physics during the last four decades, including the celebrated phenomenon of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). While the essential phenomenology of the FQHE is fairly well understood, many interesting and important questions remain, and experiments continue to reveal new puzzles. Furthermore, the coupling of FQHE to superconductivity has been predicted to produce new structures with exotic particles, which have so far evaded confirmation. A major thrust in this proposal will be to study interacting topological states supporting exotic particles, such as Majoranas or skyrmions. Such states can arise naturally as a result of pairing in the FQHE, which will be investigated within a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach for composite fermions in several different contexts. These include exotic f-wave pairing of composite fermions in wide semiconductor quantum wells and in higher Landau levels of monolayer graphene; interlayer s-wave pairing in double layer graphene at total filling factor equal to one; and certain other filling factors in double layer graphene where experiments have demonstrated evidence of pairing. Alternatively, such states can be engineered either by proximity-coupling a quantum Hall state to a superconductor or by exposing a superconductor to a magnetic field. Self-consistent mean-field phase diagrams will be calculated for p-wave superconductivity and for s-wave superconductivity with spin orbit coupling exposed to a magnetic fields, to determine phases with non-trivial topology. The interplay between the FQHE and superconductivity will also be investigated. Many of these states can potentially provide realizations of Majorana zero modes in the bulk, Majorana edge states, and even more complex particles. These studies are expected to suggest new and fruitful experimental directions. Certain other topics will also be addressed, such as a quantitative understanding of the FQHE gaps and identification of experimental signatures of the topological nature of the lowest-Landau-level crystal. These research directions are inspired by fundamental physics as well as by exciting ideas for future technology. A common theme is the focus on a quantitative understanding, which will be necessary for a detailed design and analysis of experiments. The students supported by this grant will be exposed to advanced computational and analytical tools, such as the quantum Monte Carlo method and quantum field theory, and thus build essential skills that should serve them well in their future endeavors."

Defining how the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic performances are correlated with the charge-carrier surface activities, the adsorption of reactants, and the modifications by cocatalyst is crucial for gaining fundamental knowledge to tailor, improve, and optimize the performances of semiconductor materials or to design materials with new functions. It is experimentally challenging, however, especially under operando conditions in electrolyte solutions and/or with applied electrochemical potentials. And the challenges are further exacerbated by the intrinsic heterogeneities of nano- and micro-structured semiconductors that present diverse types of exposed surface facets, which can differ in structure, electronic property, and interactions with various reactants. These challenges call upon high-resolution, quantitative, and operando measurements that can interrogate (photo)(electro)catalytic properties of semiconductor photoelectrodes and photocatalysts as well as the molecular processes on their surfaces. The long-term goal of this research is to acquire the knowledge and ability to engineer, manipulate, and control catalytic materials to achieve desired (photo)(electro)catalytic properties for a multitude of chemical transformations, including harvesting light for fuel production or pollutant destruction. Toward this long-term goal and addressing the experimental challenges described above, we have established a unique and internationally recognized research program that develops and applies multi-modal single-molecule/single-particle/sub-particle imaging approaches to interrogate (photo)(electro)catalysis on single catalyst particles in a spatiotemporally resolved manner and under operando conditions.

Working closely with experimental groups, we will not only validate our theoretical predictions but also guide experiments in focused discovery of energy and magnetic materials. The renewal project exploits the unique size and composition specific properties of isolated clusters and explores their potential as building blocks of functional materials. Using first-principles theory, our approach is an atom-by-atom rational design of a new class of superatomic clusters, such as superalkalis and superhalogens that not only mimic the chemistry of alkali and halogen atoms, respectively, but also are suitable for forming supersalts with unusual properties. The project deals with three interrelated thematic areas: (1) Superions as building blocks of energy materials: Realizing that hybrid solar cells and electrolytes in metal-ion batteries are salts composed of metal cations and anions, we will study a wide range of superalkalis and superhalogens as building blocks of energy materials. These include perovskite solar cells and solid-state electrolytes in Na/K-ion batteries whose properties will be tailored by choosing the size and composition of the superions. (2) Ligand assisted rational design of superelectrophilic clusters and their interaction with chemically inert species: Design and realization of stable, yet highly reactive, agents capable of converting saturated hydrocarbons and chemically inert waste into valuable products at room temperature have considerable economic and environmental importance and remain as one of the outstanding challenges in modern cluster science. We propose to study the potential of a new class of anions based on closo-borate structures BnXn-1- (n=6-12, X=CN, BO, SCN) that can bind noble gas atom Ar and activate inert molecules like N2 at room temperature. The uniqueness of these species is that the open B site, carrying a positive charge, is highly electrophilic, while being protected by the strong borate scaffold. (3) In search of realizable metastable phases of carbon and silicon: Knowing that metastable phases of matter may have properties far superior to those of their ground state (a case in point is diamond vs graphite), our focus is to develop a scheme for rational design of metastable phases of experimentally realizable matter by using molecular precursors. We propose to apply this paradigm shift in materials synthesis to study new phases of carbon and silicon-based cage clusters and study their potential for forming magnetic materials. These studies will not only complement recent experiments but also are aimed at guiding them in discovery of new materials. We will use a multi-scale approach - from molecular orbital theory to supercell band structure theory and ab-initio molecular dynamics, to carry out the above calculations. Efficient search algorithms and methodology will be developed for rational design of metastable phases of cluster-based matter. The scientific merit of this project is that it explores new frontiers of superatomic clusters as building blocks of energy and magnetic materials with potential for technological applications. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows will be trained in multidisciplinary research."

Cosgrove, Department of Biology DOE/Office of Science Program Office: BES Physical Biosciences Plants have the astonishing ability to expand a photosynthetic canopy to collect sunlight and atmospheric CO2 and package the harvested energy and carbon into cell walls, a large-scale renewable source of bioenergy and biomaterials. These processes depend on the ability of the cell wall to grow in surface area. Expansins – especially a-expansins - are key mediators of this process, but their novel physical effects on cell walls are not understood at the molecular level. In the work proposed here the PI will address this question by testing the structure-function relations of a-expansins, which are the most potent of the different classes of expansins. The recalcitrance of plant expansins to heterologous expression and the difficult physical properties of a-expansins in vitro have blocked progress towards this goal. Attempts at heterologous expression of plant expansins are being set aside in favor of an entirely different approach, based on computational modeling of an a-expansin from Arabidopsis, AtEXPA4. The model has already generated novel molecular insights into the control and actions of EXPAs. The predictions of the model will be tested by genetic complementation of an Arabidopsis line that is defective in the EXPA genes required for root hair elongation. The AtEXPA4 model enables the PI to identify residues potentially involved in pH and redox control of expansin protein dynamics and interactions with cellulose. These ideas will be tested by introducing mutated versions of AtEXPA4 in the Arabidopsis line lacking root-hair-specific expansins required for root hair elongation, to test for alterations in activity, pH sensitivity and redox sensitivity of the introduced protein. The root-hair defective Arabidopsis line was developed previously as a platform for testing the functionality of wild type and mutant EXPA genes. An additional subproject is a screen of an expression library of 200 highly diverse microbial expansin genes for novel activities (binding targets, biophysical and biochemical actions). This exploratory work is based on the hypothesis that the large diversity in microbial sequences reflects a large diversity of functionalities (substrates, physical actions, environmental optima) that evolved in the microbial world. The work is enabled by synthesis of the 200 constructs by DOE-JGI. In short, the proposed work will enable the PI to test molecular-level concepts about the mechanism and regulation of a-expansin activity and to explore microbial expansins for novel, perhaps useful and insightful, activities by these enigmatic proteins. If successful, the outcome will be deeper insights into the molecular basis of wall loosening, which is the key control of cell wall enlargement and limits accumulation of stored carbon and energy by plants."

In particular, the recent discovery of topological superconductivity in two-dimensional magnet-superconductor hybrid systems and iron-based superconductors, has opened unprecedented opportunities to study not only the emergence of quantum engineered and dynamically controlled topological phases by design, but also to investigate nanoscale, real time processes that are crucial for the implementation of quantum Clifford gates, the next important step on the path to topological quantum computing. However, there exists a critical gap in our knowledge base regarding the description of non-equilibrium processes that are crucial to achieve these objectives. The proposed research program will address this critical need: its objective is to create a comprehensive theoretical framework to explore and describe complex non-equilibrium phenomena, providing insight into their time-resolved dynamics at the atomic scale. In particular, the PI will (a) identify the key elements that govern the implementation of quantum Clifford gates in two-dimensional topological superconductors, (b) discover the microscopic mechanisms allowing us to control the nature of dynamically induced topological phases, and (c) identify design principles to engineer topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions. The rationale is that by discovering these key elements and principles, one can identify new approaches to the creation, manipulation and dynamic control of non-equilibrium phenomena at the nanoscale. The program's anticipated results will provide a constructionist framework that enables the time-resolved exploration and control of complex non-equilibrium phenomena, allowing us (a) to gain real time access to experimentally measurable quantities in Clifford gates, and to identify the optimal protocol for braiding processes, and (b) to engineer, through static or dynamic control of magnetic structures, novel topological phases in magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. The general formulation of this framework will provide the versatility to employ it in the study of other complex materials, ranging from high-temperature superconductors to topological Kondo insulators. To carry out the proposed research program, the PI will employ the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function formalism in real space and time, complemented by the Floquet-Schroedinger formalism. To identify the nature of topological phases, the PI will utilize momentum and real space methods to compute the topological invariant, the Chern number. The complementary nature of these theoretical methods will provide comprehensive insight into the local and global electronic structure and topological nature of complex materials."
Hyperthin Membranes For Gas Separations,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-FG02-05ER15720,"Regen, Steven",Steven.Regen@lehighuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","This research is focused on the design and synthesis of five novel classes of polymer membranes. The use of polymer membranes to separate gas mixtures has potential to supplement or become an alternative to cryogenic distillation and adsorption methods. Hyperthin (< 100 nm) membranes are of special interest because they lead to high permeance. Although the separation of O2 from N2 is currently the largest commercial use of polymer membranes for gas separations, newer membrane materials that afford higher O2/N2 selectivities and higher O2 permeabilities could lead to important advances and societal benefits. Further, there remains a need for next-generation CO2 separation approaches from flue gases, industrial gases, and from air. This work derives from a discovery that was recently made in which the surface modification of poly[1-(trimethylsilylpropyne) (PTMSP) via a thiol-ene click reaction with sodium 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonate resulted in membranes having a CO2 permeance that was one order of magnitude greater than prior measurement at constant selectivity. Hence, analogous membranes are now proposed that contain amine groups, which are expected to increase the CO2 permeance and the CO2/N2 selectivity via the facilitated transport of CO2. Research activities aim to increase the fractional free volume and CO2 permeances of hyperthin polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) using (i) polymers of intrinsic microporosity, (ii) polyelectrolytes that have been designed to create rumpled polyelectrolyte multilayers (iii) fluorocarbon containing polyelectrolytes and (iv) polyelectrolytes that are capable of facilitating the transport of CO2. These membranes are tested for their potential in H2/CO2 separations. Variations are tested for O2/N2 separations, though the underlying chemistry for promoting facilitated transport involves oxygen radicals. The long-range goal of this research is to di elucidate the essential design principles for facilitated transport in PTMSP based membranes, leading to new membrane systems in hyperthin form, so that they ultimately have potential as technologically-relevant membranes for the separation of gases."
Exploring ion heat transport during neutral beam heated plasmas at W7-X,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021972,"Geiger, Benedikt","Benedikt.Geiger@boardofregentsoftheuniversityofwisconsinsystem,operatingasuniversityofwisconsin-madison","['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","The stellarator concept is an attractive approach for fusion energy production, as the confining 3D magnetic field structure can be generated without strong internal plasma currents. However, recent results from the neoclassical-transport-optimized W7-X stellarator show that the required excellent ion heat confinement is only observed during transient phases in the presence of peaked density profiles. Theory suggests that the improved confinement is related to a strong reduction in ion-temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence in the presence of local density gradients, but more studies addressing this important problem from different perspectives are required. In this project, we plan to perform a detailed comparison of experimental data vs. theory for W7-X plasmas with strong neutral beam injection (NBI) heating. NBI heat deposition profiles and the level of charge exchange losses will be determined and validated using Balmer alpha spectroscopy, as these two quantities are essential for accurate calculations of the ion heat diffusivity during NBI heated experiments. Moreover, information on the ion heat-pulse diffusivity will be obtained from NBI modulation experiments. Such perturbation experiments are a widely applied method in fusion research and have become feasible at W7-X thanks to a new charge exchange spectroscopy system operated by UW Madison that allows for measurement of local impurity ion temperatures at different radial positions. The obtained heat diffusivities will be compared to neoclassical transport predictions to estimate the remaining anomalous transport. The resulting anomalous heat diffusivities will then be analyzed using linear and non-linear gyrokinetic simulations. Synthetic diagnostics will be developed to additionally compare the gyrokinetic simulation results to fluctuation measurements that will provide a better understanding of the specific impact of the 3D geometry and profiles on turbulence. In addition, the validated nonlinear simulations will be used to develop reduced turbulent transport models. The vision is to work towards the identification of mechanisms to alter the magnetic field configuration resulting in reduced ITG turbulent transport."
Effects of Surface Water Fluctuations and Sediment Movement on Hyporheic Zone Biogeochemistry and Microbial Communities,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021402,"Strom, Kyle",Kyle.Strom@virginiapolytechnicinstituteandstateuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Effects of Surface Water Fluctuations and Sediment Movement on Hyporheic Zone Biogeochemistry and Microbial Communities Erich T. Hester, Virginia Tech (Principal Investigator) Kyle Strom and Mark A. Widdowson, Virginia Tech (Co-Investigators) The hyporheic zone (HZ) is the region in sediment beneath and adjacent to streams, rivers, and riverine estuaries where groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) mix. The HZ provides habitat to aquatic organisms and improves water quality in watersheds. Water quality improvements are due to beneficial reactions carried out by microbes such as bacteria in the sediment. Much prior research has investigated these reactions in the HZ, but it generally assumed that sediment is immobile, and rates of reaction do not change over time. Yet key unique aspects of the HZ include 1) the impact of SW water level fluctuations (due to storms, dam operations, etc) which alter supplies of key chemicals needed for these reactions (such as carbon and oxygen), and 2) continually shifting sediment on river bottoms that affect exchange patterns. Both of these controls should substantially influence beneficial reactions in the HZ, yet remain poorly understood. As a result, modeling tools that can predict how such reactions will vary with natural conditions and human actions currently do not exist. Our project will initiate the development of such modeling tools that simulate the effects of SW water level fluctuations and sediment migration on distribution of microbes in the sediment which will allow us to better simulate the beneficial chemical reactions. This exploratory grant will focus on 1) SW water level fluctuations and river bottom sediment movement that occur during non-storm conditions for much of the year, 2) riverbed dunes which are common riverbed sediment features that induce HZ exchange which often dominates HZ effects on watershed water quality, and 3) the effects of carbon infusion from SW and sediment movement on microbial distribution and hence beneficial reactions that remove excess nitrogen (a widespread nutrient that is a pollutant at high concentrations). This exploratory project will then serve as a springboard to future projects that will extend this approach in multiple directions. Our technical objectives are to 1) create and test a modeling approach that simulates migration of sediment dunes along river bottoms, 2) add SW and GW water flow and exchange across river bottoms to the model, including reactions and microbial growth, and 3) use the developed models to test the following hypotheses: H1) increases in SW flow velocity and water level during modest river stage fluctuations (e.g., from daily hydropower operation) increase dune migration speed which in turn controls spatial variation in carbon intrusion from SW into the HZ, and hence HZ microbial communities and rates of nitrogen reactions; and H2) intrusion of seasonably-variable carbon and microbes from SW into the dune-induced HZ impacts the spatial distribution and activity of HZ microbial communities, again regulating rates of nitrogen reactions. We plan two tasks to test Hypotheses H1 and H2. Task 1 will entail model development to address Objectives 1 and 2. For Objective 1, we will link a SW model (e.g., FLUENT/OpenFOAM) to a GW model (MODFLOW/SEAM3D) to simulate processes pertinent to H1 and then adapt the GW component of the model to a moving frame of reference to add processes pertinent to H2, i.e. migration of dunes and their impact on hyporheic zone flow and transport. For Objective 2, we will add microbial growth and migration to the modeling approach. Task 2 will use the models developed in Task 1 to test H1 and H2, thus addressing Objective 3. This proposal aligns with the Subsurface Biogeochemical Research program priority to quantify and predict how water movement in watersheds drives fine-scale chemical processes in surface-subsurface systems that is the focus of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Science Focus Area program. Our long-term vision is to use this exploratory grant to provide the foundation for longer term research efforts to continue model development toward a more comprehensive systems-based approach to simulate the effects of dynamic river conditions on HZ water exchange, sediment migration, chemical reactions, and microbe migration and growth, in turn providing input to larger watershed-scale models."
Studies of Particle Transport in High-Energy-Density Plasma in the Presence of a Megagauss Magnetic Field,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019100,"Quevedo, Hernan",Hernan.Quevedo@theuniversityoftexasataustin,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Studies of particle transport in high-energy-density Hernan Javier Quevedo (PI) and Todd Ditmire (Co-Investigator), The University of Texas at Austin Alexey Arefiev, University of California San Diego (Co-Investigator) Charged particle transport in a magnetic field is among the most fundamental aspects in plasma physics. Frequently a magnetic field is introduced in plasma devices to suppress particle and heat transport. Obviously magnetic confinement of fusion plasmas is an example of controlling particle transport across field lines to achieve desired plasma conditions. The particle transport in regimes relevant to conventional magnetized fusion devices has been well studied. In contrast, particle and heat transport in magnetized high-energy-density plasmas remains relatively unexplored. The thrust of the work proposed here is to perform experimental studies, supported by rigorous theory and computations, of particle transport in strong magnetic fields. This we will do by creating plasmas in well-defined and controlled geometry and density conditions with lasers within strong pulsed magnetic fields. Our proposed experiments promise to derive quantitative measurements of a fundamental plasma property under largely unexplored conditions of plasma density, temperature and field strength. The rapid development of the laboratory high-energy-density (HED) plasma physics has been driven by development of lasers with femtosecond pulse duration and terawatt to petawatt peak pulse power. These lasers enable experiments in which large extremes in temperature and pressure can be accessed. The key difficulty for studying particle transport in magnetized HED plasmas is the requirement to generate an external field strong enough to alter the particle dynamics. Recent developments in compact pulsed power technology offers a viable solution by enabling generation of a megagauss magnetic field on a ms time scale within coils of the order of 1 cm in diameter. Such fields can effectively serve as a static uniform field for nanosecond time scale, laser-produced HED plasmas. The goal of this project is to measure experimentally and examine computationally and theoretically particle transport in previously unexplored regimes in a laser-generated HED plasma embedded in a strong magnetic field (up to 30 T). We are in a unique position to carry out this study; expertise at creating and diagnosing well-characterized laser-generated HED plasma filaments and we have an ongoing close collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) - the world experts in pulsed power technology. We will create the necessary experimental conditions using a laser-irradiated clustering gas jet to generate a cylindrical plasma with variable electron and ion energies. We will use the Portable Current Source developed at SNL to generate a megagauss-scale magnetic field. The subsequent plasma dynamics will be examined using short pulse optical &ldquo;pump-probe&rdquo; imaging techniques as well as time-integrated diagnostics measuring electron and ion energy spectra. We will study two basic features of a plasma filament located in a gas jet and embedded in a magnetic field: 1) radial confinement of the bulk hot ion population, and 2) cross field transport of an energetic electron minority. We will access a previously unexplored regime where hot ions are confined electrostatically, rather than magnetically, via charge separation from a strongly magnetized bulk electron population. This regime has direct relevance to those experiments where compression of a fusion-type plasma with an embedded magnetic field takes place (the MagLif approach or the MIFEDS used in OMEGA implosions). We will also model a novel regime where the sheath electric field that typically inhibits electron transport becomes the catalyst for rapid electron expansion that is not limited by the ion mobility. A simulated megagauss-scale magnetic field will allow us to examine the impact of electron magnetization on the transport rate in this regime. This transport mechanism involves a sheath field that is present in most HED plasma experiments and, therefore, can have a potentially broad impact in many HED experiments. Our control over the initial plasma conditions will also enable us to investigate the transition from the already understood regimes to the unexplored HED regimes."

Solar energy is a clean, renewable source of energy with substantial capacity to replace fossil fuels and meet rising global energy needs. Meeting this challenge means understanding photosynthetic energy conversion at a molecular level, a task requiring perspectives from all disciplines of science. The 18th International Congress on Photosynthesis (IPC) is facilitating just that by providing a forum for scientists from all corners of the world to come together to share ideas and build new collaborations that will improve the lives of future generations. A vibrant knowledge of each of the diverse aspects of basic and applied photosynthesis research obviously depends upon a healthy scientific exchange among the members of the research community. While senior scientists are more likely able to make the long trip to this important meeting, the travel costs for students and postdocs would otherwise prohibit participation for talented junior US scientists. At the same time, this is precisely the kind of meeting that strengthens interest and careers in the important scientific directions represented by this conference. For all scientists this is an opportunity to learn firsthand about the very latest advances in the field and to meet and brainstorm with collaborators as well as make new collaborations. For junior scientists, this funding is giving an opportunity to do these things plus it is often the first tangible experience regarding the global, international significance of their own projects. Overall, the diversity of topics and technical approaches is providing an extremely stimulating multidisciplinary environment for junior and senior scientists performing research in a variety of areas that are within the scope to the US DOE mission. In collaboration with the executive members of the North American Photosynthesis Conference Association (NAPCA) and the International Society of Photosynthesis research (ISPR), a competitive selection of junior participants is being made based upon the quality of the abstracts and materials submitted by self-identified candidates that have applied following a broadcast call for applications from junior US scientists.

Unfortunately, exact classical numerical computation is infeasible even for simplified models, and approximation methods do not produce accurate results for many problems. Quantum computers promise to be able to perform accurate materials simulation at significantly reduced computational cost. However, state-of-the-art quantum simulation algorithms for implementing these tasks will require thousands of qubits with high-fidelity control to outperform classical computers, which is out of reach for near-term quantum hardware. In this project, we will develop a new “holographic” quantum simulation algorithm and co-designed superconducting quantum processor and apply them to various problems related to understanding the physics of strongly correlated electron systems. Our goal is to show that this co-designed hardware and software can demonstrate quantum advantage over classical simulations by efficiently using the resources of moderate-size, noisy quantum processors. Holographic simulation is inspired by classical tensor network techniques to indirectly encode the quantum state of a material in an efficiently-compressed, quantum tensor network state (qTNS) representation. This qTNS representation uses a quantum memory to greatly reduce the number of processor qubits that calculate the desired correlations, and thus fundamentally limits the impact of noise and errors. The hardware required is further reduced through mid-circuit measurement and qubit recycling techniques. A final, substantial, increase in hardware efficiency is achieved by using an array of superconducting cavities to act as multi-level memory “qudits"" coupled to a small number of processor “qubits”. This co-designed approach should result in quantum advantage with far fewer physical devices than qubit-only platforms running traditional quantum simulation algorithms. We will apply our algorithm and hardware to three specific simulation tasks that fall within the broad umbrella unraveling the physics of strongly correlated electron systems (SCES): (1) holographic preparation of ground- and thermal- states of correlated magnetic and electronic systems including quasi-2d frustrated-spin, Fermi-Hubbard, and fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems, (2) holographic-simulation of long-time out-of-equilibrium dynamics, and (3) holographic analogs of embedding methods such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and density-matrix embedding theory (DMET) to solve systems with complex structure or long-range interactions. These tasks are prototypes for the kinds of material simulation problems, such as the simulation of multiferroic materials, perovskite photovoltaics and high-temperature superconductors, that tax the capabilities of the most powerful classical supercomputers. Our work will substantially reduce the size and fidelity requirements for quantum simulation of realistic materials and devices, bringing practical quantum material simulations closer to the capabilities of near-term hardware."

They are also promising candidates for new kinds of quantum information processing and quantum sensing devices employing optical technology. Therefore, understanding and controlling the nature of molecular excitons better than before will help develop more cost-effective photovoltaic devices and identify successful quantum information/sensing methods. In particular, new capability to monitor and control the energetics and the dynamics of molecular excitons at nanometer length scales can lead to significant breakthroughs. The objective of this research is to guide and assist such advances through integrative theoretical and computational projects. On one hand, this research is focused on bringing better understanding of the relationship between detailed molecular features, spectroscopic data, and microscopic information on dynamics of molecular excitons. This effort is imperative especially for intermediate size molecular excitons in the range of 10-100 nanometer length scales, which are too complicated to be described by simple models but are not in well-known infinite size limits that allow application of traditional theories. On the other hand, this research aims at finding new ways to positively exploit rich features of molecular excitons in intermediate size regime, for the development of more efficient solar energy conversion devices and new methods of quantum information processing and sensing. Thus, two goals are being pursued in this research. One is more accurate computational modeling of molecular excitons and the other is to theoretical investigation of novel methods to control the spatio-temporal dynamics of excitons. This research consists of five complementary projects that are strategically different. The first is focused on gaining more accurate understanding of the spectroscopy of molecular excitons of medium to large sizes. Due to the intermediate nature of sizes and the abundance of parameters that can be used to specify the models, clear physical understanding of their spectroscopic features and their implications for long range exciton dynamics are generally lacking. These issues will be resolved by systematic investigation of the spectroscopy and long-range exciton dynamics for a series of well-defined models of molecular excitons. This information can serve as building blocks for modeling larger scale solar light harvesting systems. The second project is to identify and understand important physical effects related to the coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom that are ignored by standard models for excitons. This will help develop more realistic models of molecular excitons. The third project is to develop theories and computational methods for controlling the dynamics of excitons through the application of time dependent fields. This will be pursued through well-established optimal quantum control theory and machine learning approaches. Outcomes of this investigation will help develop new ways to utilize molecular excitons for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. The fourth project is to characterize and determine the stability of excitons at larger length scales where they can be viewed as bound pairs of an effective electron and its hole. Well-established simulation techniques employing Feynman path integral formulation will be employed in order to investigate the effects of confinement and medium response on the binding/dissociation energies of excitons and their recombination. The fifth project is to develop a more general coarse-grained dynamics simulation method of molecular excitons that can be applied to larger and complex systems more efficiently than existing methods. The five projects pursued in this research will collectively contribute to a better understanding of how to prepare the right environment to realize optimal dynamics of molecular excitons, by establishing computational methods capable of both accurately modeling experimental results and efficiently exploring extensive regimes of parameter sets. Outcomes of these projects will also help generate extensive data sets that can be fed into data science approaches to optimize the dynamics and the spectroscopy of molecular excitons. In addition to these passive control methods, the third project, theoretical investigation of methods to control excitons dynamics through intervention with external time dependent fields, will be able to help identify new active control mechanisms of excitons. Pursing both passive and active control mechanisms of molecular excitons, as proposed in this research, can also lead to new holistic techniques of quantum information processing and quantum sensing employing molecular excitons."

ZIFs are nanoporous molecular sieves with potential for application to a range of membrane- and adsorption-based gas separations. The research approach will employ vapor-phase synthesis, testing, simulation, and characterization approaches in order to test hypotheses regarding the flexibility of nanoconfined ZIFs. This class of nanocomposite ZIF thin films is unique and exhibits interesting separations performance in part because of a unique synthesis approach: an all-vapor-phase ligand induced permselectivation (LIPS) method (Science 361, 1008-1011 (2018)), and a modification of LIPS through a vapor phase linker/ligand treatment (VPLT) method that leads to large selectivity improvements for certain gas mixtures (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 58, 16390 –16394 (2019)). In particular, the propylene/propane separation performance of LIPS/VPLT ZIF membranes confined (entirely or partially) inside mesopores is remarkably superior to that of most conventional ZIF membranes consisting of unconfined (deposited on the external surface of porous supports) polycrystalline films. However, a fundamental understanding of the factors that lead to such performance is not available. It is hypothesized that the mesoporous support, which serves as the matrix of the selective ZIF component of the membrane, through interfacial interactions plays a vital role in affecting the ZIF structure. The combination of LIPS with VPLT is an essential part of a methodology for testing this hypothesis. This research consists of four interwoven methodological challenges: (i) extension of the LIPS/VPLT methods to create a range of membrane nanostructures; (ii) adsorption isotherm and diffusivity determination using a combination of experiments and mathematical analysis; (iii) structure determination; and (iv) molecular-level understanding using simulations. Task 1 will be performed at JHU (Tsapatsis) to address (i) and (ii) above, while Task 2 will encompass characterization methods (iii) and be accomplished at Brookhaven National Lab and SBU (Boscoboinik). Task 3 focusses on simulations (iv), and it will be performed at UMN (Siepmann). Overall, this research elucidates structural characteristics that are responsible for the high performance of confined ZIF nanocomposites in order to extend the use of LIPS and VPLT to other confined metal organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites."
Harnessing the power of big omics data: Novel statistical tools to study the role of microbial communities in fundamental biological processes,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021016,"Solis-Lemus, Claudia","Claudia.Solis-Lemus@boardofregentsoftheuniversityofwisconsinsystem,operatingasuniversityofwisconsin-madison","['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Microbial communities are among the main driving forces of biogeochemical processes in the biosphere. In particular, many critical soil processes such as mineral weathering, and soil cycling of mineral-sorbed organic matter are governed by mineral-associated microbes. Understanding the composition of microbial communities and what environmental factors play a role in shaping this composition is crucial to comprehend soil biological processes and to predict microbial responses to environmental changes. In order to identify the driving factors in soil biological processes, we need robust statistical tools that are able to connect a set of predictors with a specific phenotype. Yet, the innovation in the statistical theory for biochemical and biophysical processes has not matched the increasing complexity of soil data. Indeed, existing statistical techniques have four main drawbacks: 1) they perform poorly on high-dimensional highly sparse data, such as soil metagenomics; 2) they ignore spatial correlation structure which can be a key component in soil-related data; 3) they do not provide valid p-values under high-dimensional settings making them unable to detect significant factors driving the phenotype of interest, and 4) they tend to focus on abundance matrices to represent microbial compositions which can be flawed due to its compositional nature (sum to 1 restriction) that affects how proportions behave in different experimental settings (e.g. changes in proportions in the microbial composition does not necessarily reflect actual biological changes in the interactions). The overall objective of this proposal is to pioneer the development of the next generation of statistical theory (accompanied by open-source publicly available software) for soil omics data. Our novel statistical methods will overcome existing challenges in standard approaches in three ways: 1) they will inherently account for high-dimensional highly interconnected data through the development of novel mixed-effects sparse learning models; 2) they will produce valid adaptive p-values through post selection inference, and 3) they will be implemented in open-source publicly available software that will serve the broader scientific community. By harnessing the power of big data through revolutionary new statistical theory in sparse learning, and post selection inference, our work will produce tools to better understand the drivers in soil biological phenotypes and to allow new insights into fundamental biological processes. In addition, our easy-to-use open-source software will be user-friendly, will have extensive documentation and step-by-step tutorials, and will require no technical programming expertise.

There is currently a lack of broadly available modeling software to self-consistently capture the required physics of gain, thermal loading and lensing, spectral shaping, and other effects required to quantitatively design such lasers. The first objective is to validate new computational models from Phase 1 via comparison with experimental data in a parameter regime relevant to kHz repetition rate, kW-scale (average power) Ti:sapphire laser amplifiers. The second objective is to demonstrate correct integrated modeling of a 100 TW (peak power) amplifier via comparison with experimental measurements. The third objective is to develop a browser-based GUI suitable for use by the laser design community, to be built on easy-to-use, open source software. During Phase 1, new algorithms were developed and implemented in software to model laser wavefronts propagating through Ti:sapphire crystals, including aspects of amplification and thermal effects. A novel operator splitting approach has been developed, where both the stretched laser pulse and the crystal are sliced in a manner that enables robust algorithms, accuracy and interactive solutions. Full Fourier optics of the laser pulse is included, using a novel theoretical treatment of wavefront propagation that leverages an open source physical optics code. Thermal modeling of a cylindrical Ti:sapphire crystal has been demonstrated, using a parallel open source differential equation solver. A prototype online graphical user interface has been developed, leveraging an open source framework for scientific cloud computing. The Phase 1 algorithms and software will be generalized to include linear canonical transforms based on arbitrary optical transport matrices, and to include non-linear effects in the index of refraction and the gain within a Ti:sapphire crystal that has been pumped with realistic asymmetries. The laser pulse model will be generalized to include finite bandwidth effects. The thermal properties of Ti:sapphire crystals will be further simulated, including mechanical stress. Experimental measurements at a state-of-the-art laser-plasma facility will be used to validate the software. The cloud-based graphical user interface will be completed and made available. The software developed for this project will be open source, and novel aspects of the software design will be published in the scientific literature. The cloud computing approach is uniquely powerful. New users are up and running in minutes and can share simulations instantaneously. Subscription-based sales and associated consulting will generate significant revenue."

Therefore, there is a need for field-deployed cost-effective bifacial irradiance sensors, to enable PV system performance assessment and monitoring. We propose to continue the development and evaluation of proprietary irradiance technologies for bifacial projects as disclosed in U.S. Patent Applications 16/912,273 and 17/214,978. This work was started during our Phase I SBIR and the project is intended to provide low-cost high-accuracy irradiance sensors to the PV industry. The Company is working with Sandia National Laboratories, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, SunPower Corporation, and 7x Energy on field testing and evaluation. The problem is currently being addressed by higher cost measurement systems which limit the adoption by the industry. Our overall approach to the combined Phase I and Phase II projects is to prove the technical feasibility of the technology and to build the initial commercial units. In the Phase I program, we implemented a successful approach to measuring global, direct, diffuse, and ground-reflected radiation using an array of PV reference cells with no moving parts. We built and installed outdoor testing stations to prove the concept. We also prototyped sub-components needed for compact irradiance sensors. Our plan for Phase II is to continue the work started in Phase I, including developing compact integrated devices suitable for commercialization, refining measurement algorithms, and proving performance through additional field trials at multiple locations. In addition, Phase II work will include a focus on design for manufacturing, software control and analysis, cost reduction, and system reliability. The commercial applications of the project include the possibility to provide low- cost high-accuracy irradiance measurements for PV power plants so they can optimize their operations. This will lower the cost of PV power generation and make it more widely available. Phase I and Phase II will lead to initial commercialization of the technology and Phase III (if necessary) will continue the project to full commercialization."

Cosmic microwave background measurements characterize the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the universe. A critical component of cosmic microwave background observation is the feedhorn antenna, used to convey and focus waves onto a transition-edge-sensor bolometer operating at cryogenic temperatures. Current materials and manufacturing processes for feedhorn arrays have poor thermal expansion coefficient match to the Si detector, and it is not possible to manufacture high frequency array structures due to the softness of the materials and tight tolerances required for detector operation. The challenges of manufacturing system complexity, and anticipated ~500 cosmic microwave background detector arrays, set the need. The objective is to enable manufacturing of high frequency feedhorn arrays, while reducing manufacturing costs, used in cosmic microwave background stage-4 high energy physics experiments by developing and demonstrating the potential of combined additive manufacturing and electrofinishing approaches. In Phase I, the manufacturing processes to fabricate feedhorn arrays were developed. Specifically, only two distinct manufacturing operations were required: (1) additive manufacturing build development, and (2) final electrofinishing (shaping and polishing) of feedhorns to targeted design dimensions set by the cosmic microwave background detector community. The cost effectiveness of the approach will be realized through reduced material waste, higher resolution products, and enhanced detector sensitivity. Phase II will refine the additive manufacturing and electrochemical finishing approaches and enable the production of feedhorn sub-arrays (36 feedhorns) that can be evaluated for their performance within a cosmic microwave background radiation environment. Specifically, the manufactured feedhorn sub-arrays for stage 4 cosmic microwave background detectors will be tested via metrology and beam mapping at sub-K temperatures and validated for transition to full scale (432) feedhorn arrays produced in a Phase IIB/III program. Phase III will transition and integrate the manufacturing process into full stage 4 cosmic microwave background detectors detector modules. Commercial applications for the formation and finishing of refractory materials via the combined additive manufacturing and electrochemical surface finishing processes could find applications within aerospace, medical, automotive, or industrial power systems."

The government has produced a scientific software system that contains state-of-the-art geologic carbon storage analysis capabilities, but its user interface and software distribution paradigm are not sufficiently developed to meet a “market-ready” standard required for wider application by industry and regulatory stakeholders. This project will generate innovative user interfaces for government-supplied scientific software. Support for flexible workflows, provenance capture to document simulation history, advanced visualization capabilities, risk management support, and integration features to other geologic carbon storage software will be provided. Professional quality user interfaces and distribution methods will be produced. During the Phase I, a broad set of interviews with a number of stakeholder groups were held to define requirements for the software and to iterate on designs. Detailed architecture plans and screen designs were devised and documented. A working prototype of a portion of the software system was constructed and demonstrated to show the feasibility of the approach along with a prototype software distribution mechanism. During the Phase II, the workflows that have already been defined and designed will be fully implemented. Continued stakeholder interviews and close interaction with developers at the government sponsor are planned to generate further workflows supporting more users. Processing of external reservoir simulator data will be enabled, simulation lifecycle management facilities developed, and other advanced features developed. Quarterly alpha and beta test releases are planned in order to fully test the software in the field. Geologic carbon storage is important for reduction in atmospheric greenhouse gas increases from large CO2 producers. Industry, government, and academia are studying the long term risks and science of geologic carbon storage to mature the technologies. Having a professional software interface overlaying the deep scientific tools will broaden the use of the tools, improving the time to regulatory approval of the engineered systems and acceptance by the general public"

However, adoption of proven CO2 capture technologies is constrained by high cost, which would increase the price of electricity beyond acceptance. A novel, step-change membrane is being developed in this project that can significantly reduce the CO2 capture cost. The approach in Phase I was to develop new membrane materials and scalable membranes based on block copolymers (BCPIMs) of rubbery poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and polymerizable metal-organic frameworks (polyMOFs) with superior CO2/N2 separation properties. The membranes that were developed, achieved a CO2 permeability target of =2,000 Barrer, a CO2/N2 selectivity target of =40 and showed good stability in the presence of water vapor, SOx, and NOx. Thin-film composite (TFC) membranes, including the selective layer, a highly permeable, polymer gutter layer, and a microporous substrate were fabricated and tested to confirm proof-of-concept. The separation properties were shown to be independent of the feed gas compositions and pressures, demonstrating their potential for flue gas treatment. A preliminary techno-economic analysis (TEA) was performed based on the projected commercial TFC membrane module performance of the new BCP-MOF materials synthesized in Phase1. The capture cost was projected to be as low as $20-22/ton, which is less than the U.S. Department of Energy’s nominal target of ~$30-40/ton. CO2 purities of 78-90% can be achieved with membranes alone, but adding a cryogenic back end can increase the product purity to ~100% at an added cost of ~$8-10/ton. Phase II plans focus on optimizing the TFC membrane for CO2 permeance =4,500 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity =40, scaling-up TFC membrane fabrication, conducting long-term testing of membrane resistance to contaminants, fabricating small modules, validating process performance, defining the optimal CO2 capture process, and refining the TEA. Development and commercialization of this cost-effective CO2 membrane capture process technology will create domestic jobs and promote economic growth, while reducing global warming."

This includes understanding of the mechanism underlying the ‘quantum efficiency’ of light harvesting, including not only the internal quantum efficiency which is known from kinetic measurements to achieve near unit values under weak light conditions, but also the role of the very low probability for absorption of light and an understanding of the spatiotemporal nature of the absorption of individual photons and subsequent dynamics of electronic excitations. This project addresses these objectives by developing tools using novel quantum light sources to probe the interaction of light with natural photosynthetic systems under controlled single photon conditions. The use of quantum light sources, in particular sources generating pairs of photons that can be used for two-photon or heralded single photon experiments, with control over the several properties of the individual photons provides a powerful new toolbox for this. It allows experimental investigation of both the absorption of individual photons and the subsequent spatio-temporal dynamics of electronic excitations within a photosynthetic complex. Achieving our long-term goal also requires new theory that combines advanced knowledge of quantum optics and stochastic processes with the set of open quantum system simulation and non-linear spectroscopy calculation techniques that have been used so effectively to understand the details of excitonic energy transport in recent years. In the next two years we shall undertake coupled experimental and theoretical studies of the dynamics of excited states resulting from heralded single photon absorption. We shall perform pump-probe experiments with individual photons and also a develop a novel “sample-HOM” interferometric experiment using a pair of indistinguishable photons. Both of these techniques can yield dynamic information about the excited states. We shall carry out complementary theoretical simulations of underlying dynamics, using methods of stochastic quantum trajectories that are conditioned on observations of detection/lack of detection of transmitted/fluorescent photons, combined with realistic descriptions of chromophore-vibrational couplings. Our approach of experiments employing heralded single photons together with theory employing conditional quantum trajectories based on photon counting measurements provides a new quantum lens for the microscopic study of photosynthetic systems with quantum light. Demonstration and analysis of quantum jumps in the elemental stage of absorption of light energy in a complex biological system is a topic of fundamental interest. It is also of specific import for light harvesting, since it implies that the notion of quantum efficiency is valid for each individual photon, and not just an average metric. Together, the photon counting experiments and coupled theoretical quantum trajectory analyses in this project will generate new insights into the spatio-temporal evolution of the excited states accessed by absorption of single photons. The project will result in training of one postdoc and one Project Scientist in a new emerging area of single photon quantum probes of photosynthesis."

In this context, the use of renewably sourced energy, such as that from sunlight, to drive important chemical transformations, whether directly via photocatalysis or indirectly via electrocatalysis, is an exciting opportunity that is attracting a great deal of interest within the catalysis community. This research emphasizes fundamentally new approaches towards reductive electrocatalysis. Controlling the selectivity of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions, in particular by limiting competitive hydrogen generation, provides a powerful strategy for mediating reductive transformations. This research effort focuses on the development of new classes of highly reactive PCET mediators that can facilitate the net transfer of protons from solution and electrons from an electrode to an acceptor substrate, thereby mediating an overall reduction reaction whereby H-atom equivalents are transferred. Demonstrating and studying the mechanisms of PCET reactions with challenging substrates via these mediators provides an important set of goals for moving this sub-field forward. In Objective 1 we build on exciting progress from our previous grant period, where we successfully targeted and characterized new organometallic species in which formal protonation of a cyclopentadienide (Cp) ring leads to remarkably weak (<35 kcal•mol-1) and hence highly reactive C-H bonds capable of PCETC-H. We will pursue in-depth spectroscopic (e.g., continuous wave (CW) and pulse EPR at X- and Q-band) and complementary theoretical studies, to better understand the nature of these species. Fascinating electronic structure and mechanistic questions arise from them, and their potential to mediate challenging reductive transformations motivates our interest. We will hence target a diverse family of PCETC-H reagents amenable to systematic studies of their spectroscopic, thermochemical, and reactivity patterns. In Objective 2 we pursue organometallic PCET mediators that can be interfaced with electrochemistry to enable efficient and selective reductive electrocatalysis (ePCET). Our mediators are designed to facilitate the rapid co-localization of a proton and an electron equivalent, affording strong substrate reduction capacity via PCET from an N-H bond (<40 kcal•mol-1), while kinetically suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Preferential substrate selectivity relative to HER is a major challenge in reductive electrocatalysis; to achieve this goal our mediator design combines a redox active center (e.g., a metallocene) with a tethered but electronically insulated Brønsted base. Akin to Objective 1, we will pursue a diverse set of organometallic ePCET mediators via this design concept for foundational mechanistic studies, as well as to broadly explore their utility for catalysis driven at an electrode. In this context we will emphasize reductive transformations with unsaturated organic compounds as probe substrates."
Using root and soil traits to forecast woody encroachment dynamics in mesic grassland,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019037,"Nippert, Jesse",Jesse.Nippert@kansasstateuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Grasslands are a widespread and globally important biome providing key ecosystem services including carbon (C) storage and regulation of the water cycle. Grasslands face multiple threats, including changes in drought intensity and woody encroachment - a process that results in increased woody plant abundance corresponding with decreased herbaceous plant abundance. The combination of reduced soil moisture and shifts in plant dominance from herbaceous to woody are likely to alter C pools in the soil profile. We currently do not have the capacity to predict either the magnitude or rates of change in these C pools. In order to predict changes in grassland vegetation structure and the associated impacts on C cycling, we require a better understanding of the distribution of soil C pools at multiple soil depths, and the responses of these pools to changes in precipitation. The Land Surface Model (LSM) component of Earth System Models has the ability to capture these dynamic changes in ecosystem function, but currently lacks the data to accurately parameterize these processes at multiple depths within the soil profile. To support and perform this parameterization, we will undertake a detailed investigation of root and soil traits at varying soil depths, to capture the belowground impacts of changing dominant plant growth forms (grasses to shrubs) and the impacts of frequent drought. We have developed a set of objectives that combine observational, experimental and modeling approaches to improve our ability to predict ecosystem consequences of shrub encroachment and drought in the US Great Plains region. These objectives are: (1) Quantify differences in aboveground (stem and leaf biomass) and belowground C pools (root C, microbial C, bulk soil C) using detailed excavations of entire mixed shrub-grass assemblages. We will also subsample portions of the rhizosphere for detailed root physiological and microbial activity measurements, to provide information on rates of change in soil C pools; (2) Using rainout shelters built over mature shrub-grass communities, we will experimentally reduce the amount of precipitation. Comparing responses between shrubs and grasses, we will measure differences in source-water use, above and belowground productivity, canopy water stress, soil C pools and microbial C-cycling activity, and changes in plant cover and community dynamics; (3) Using a global demographic LSM (CLM FATES), we will forecast the impacts of available water on shrub-grass cover in the central Great Plains region, and the resulting effects of these dynamics on ecosystem services (aboveground production, above- and belowground C budgets). Results from this project will define the depth-resolved feedbacks of drought and dominant vegetation on belowground root architecture, soil microbial C cycling, and ecosystem C balance. The observation-experiment-modeling framework used here will improve our understanding of interactions and feedbacks between aboveground and belowground processes, by specifically measuring plant-soil-microbial traits at various depths in the soil profile. The details of these coupled interactions (plant-soil-microbial) will improve the representation of subsurface processes in LSMs and will improve forecasts of dynamic changes in ecosystem structure in grassland ecosystems."

One big challenge for depositing a coating on aluminum is that special pretreatment is required owing to aluminum’s highly reactive nature. Even though electroless nickel coatings have been successful thus far for Neutrino Focusing Horns, the complexity and environmental concerns regarding the large amounts of hazard pretreatment chemical usage have triggered the need for a different process. This program is developing a simple and scalable electrochemical approach that consists of sequential pretreatment and electrodeposition process steps to clean and prepare the aluminum surface and subsequently directly electrodeposit a hard nickel alloy coating on the aluminum horn surface. The coating process is more cost effective, less complex and uses a smaller volume of chemicals than the electroless nickel coating for aluminum Neutrino Focusing Horns. Phase II demonstrated and validated the scalability of pulse reverse electrochemical pretreatment followed by direct electrodeposition of nickel phosphorous onto prototype Neutrino Focusing Horn segments. The entire process comprised 4 steps in comparison to 16 steps required for electroless nickel deposition. The potential was shown to meet the required properties for adhesion, radiation and erosion resistance. Preliminary estimates show the potential for at least 50% cost saving compared to electroless nickel for sub-scale components, with more significant savings anticipated for full- size parts. Critical transition pathway was identified to commercialize the technology. Phase IIB will be directed towards transition and commercialization of the technology to electrodeposit nickel with similar or better performance than the current electroless nickel coating on a full-scale Neutrino Focusing Horn. Transition the technology to strategic commercialization partners by designing and building the required tooling and electrochemical cells, validate by processing the full-scale horn with the desired coating uniformity across the part. Economics and commercialization plan of the low-cost, scalable electrochemical approach will be finalized for market entry. Direct electroplating on aluminum is of critical importance to industry. The proposed technology has the potential to positively impact society by reducing hazard chemical usage, and enhance the usage of the aluminum across applications. The technology is adaptable to applications that require electrodeposited coatings on passive metals such as aluminum, titanium and stainless steels."

The focus of the proposal is to use the best method, either decay or reaction based, to answer the most pertinent questions of nuclear structure and astrophysics. The objectives to complete current analyses through publication, to write new proposals, including for Day 1 at FRIB, and to continue developing tools and techniques to maximize the scientific output from the experiments performed. This proposal describes a three-year program of research in aspects of experiment physics of nuclei using decay measurements and low-energy nuclear reactions. Having expertise in both sub-fields, we are able to study the most interesting nuclei available with different techniques. One example is in the region around 100Sn, where we propose studying the nature of super-allowed a-decay and measuring the lifetime of the d5/2 state in 101Sn using decay studies and are planning to propose an experiment to resolve the ordering of low-lying states in 101Sn using a knockout reaction. Our research has a focus on regions around the magic nuclei 48Ni, 60Ca, 78Ni, 100Sn, and 132Sn. We propose studying nuclei important to nova nucleosynthesis as well as those close to the astrophysical r- and rp-processes. We also plan to continue studies into halo nuclei, to complete the analysis of 13Be and start a new measurement on 8B. At the opposite corner of the chart of the nuclei, we propose to continue our critical contributions to Superheavy element and isotope searches. Our methods include ß-decay, for example of 54Ca and 60Ca, a-decay above 100Sn, and in Superheavy element searches. We use transfer reactions, to add either a neutron, or a proton, to a radioactive ion beam, and knockout reactions to remove a neutron from the beam. We use our inhouse expertise in detector development and digital data acquisition, as well as our bespoke detectors, to optimize our experimental design. Additionally, between the PIs and the students and postdocs, we have experience in shell-model calculations, reaction calculations, simulations, machine learning, and Bayesian analysis that are used for both the design and the interpretation of our experiments. An important aspect is our collaboration with theorists and experimentalists at the University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and other laboratory and university groups in the US and internationally. Some examples include the GODDESS collaboration, which gives us access to the most powerful charged-particle plus gamma-ray spectrometer in the World that we use for transfer reactions, and the FRIB Decay Station Initiator, which will have extraordinary discovery potential. The impact of the project will be through publications, invited talks, and critically, the training of early-career physicists. Our students and postdocs work on world-leading experiments, from design and setup through analysis and publication. They also receive hands-on experience in instrument development and testing.

Engstrom, Cornell University (Principal Investigator) Robert A. DiStasio Jr., Cornell University (Co-Investigator) The incorporation of both conventional and new materials into next-generation device structures at the nm scale will require the development of robust and precise atomic-scale control over deposition, patterning, and etching processes. Such a revolution in nanofabrication will usher in a series of highly anticipated state-of-the-art devices with applications spanning novel computing and storage paradigms (e.g., neuromorphic computing, co-placement of computing and memory), nanorobotics (e.g., mechanical systems for sensing and actuation at the nanoscale), as well as countless examples throughout biomedical engineering and the energy-related sciences. Over the past decade, progress in nanofabrication has not revolved around advances in lithography, but rather the application of novel deposition and etching techniques such as self-aligned double and quadruple patterning. Here, the challenges introduced by the increasingly more three-dimensional nature of these devices (e.g., 3D-NAND memory, gate-all around transistors, etc.) has placed emphasis on the development of non-line-of-sight processes, while the proximity of atomic-scale features demands low-temperature processes (e.g., plasmas) to limit interdiffusion. Furthermore, the materials that need to be integrated into these advanced devices will include unique combinations of metals, dielectrics, and semiconductors—all of which will be exceedingly close in lateral and/or vertical proximity. As such, nanofabrication processes with the potential to overcome these significant scientific and engineering challenges will need to be both self-limited [i.e., the deposition or etching occurs in a digital or non-continuous fashion, as found in atomic layer deposition (ALD) and atomic layer etching (ALE)] and self-aligned [i.e., the growth or etching is aligned with the underlying substrate(s), as defined by their chemical composition]. With a plethora of diverse and advanced materials in close proximity, such self-aligned or area-selective processes are mission-critical for our future nanofabrication needs. In this work, we seek to develop the fundamental surface science required for self-limited area-selective deposition (ASD) on virtually any combination of ultra-thin film and substrate compositions—be it metals, dielectrics, or semiconductors. We propose to achieve this goal by using a tightly integrated combination of theory and experiment—working in conjunction to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms producing selectivity as well as the mechanisms underlying loss of selectivity—that builds on our recent successes in exploiting a competitive interaction strategy to achieve ASD. Essential to this strategy is the deliberate and simultaneous introduction of multiple chemical species, such that competition can occur between the species. In doing so, this approach runs against the orthodoxy of ALD, and provides us with an opportunity to develop a fundamentally new approach to ASD. The research proposed herein will pave the way towards addressing the grand challenges of next-generation nanofabrication and are well-aligned with the central mission of the DOE. Taken as a whole, it is our goal to greatly expand the combination of materials that may be deposited using ASD, anticipating the use of unforeseen materials and currently unanticipated combinations in next-generation devices."

Gregory Van Patten, Department of Chemistry, Middle Tennessee State University, Murfreesboro, Tennessee 37132 USA co-PI: Mengliang Zhang, Department of Chemistry, Middle Tennessee State University, Murfreesboro, Tennessee 37132 USA Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are potentially useful as synthetically tunable mid-visible light-harvesting structures in photocatalysis applications, but at present they perform inefficiently because they exhibit much faster exciton relaxation processes than expected given their large intraband energy spacings. Rapid cooling of hot carriers in QDs, involving fast intraband relaxation pathways mediated by an Auger mechanism, results in a significant loss of captured energy. The role of surface states and the presence of organic capping ligands in the mechanism of hot carrier cooling, however, remains to be fully elucidated. Developing a detailed mechanistic understanding of the influence of organic capping ligands on the dynamics of recombination and cooling in QDs is an essential precursor to the rational design of materials for light harvesting and photocatalysis. We propose that the spectroscopy and dynamics of QDs can be better understood in terms of a vibronic exciton model, in which extensive quantum coherent mixing of the electronic and vibrational states of the core semiconductor nanoparticle with those of its surface capping ligands accounts for the absorption and photoluminescence properties. This model would account for the impact of surface ligand exchange on the rates of hot carrier cooling in terms of a nonadiabatic radiationless decay mechanism, where coherent vibronic wavepacket motions are directed by branching modes involving the surface ligands. Planned Research. This hypothesis and its applications will be tested by combining state-of-the-art synthetic and analytical approaches for the synthesis and characterization of QDs (Van Patten) with broadband two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (Beck) and multireference electronic structure calculations (Levine). The planned work will lead to a fundamental advance in the understanding of how structural features of QDs can exploit vibronic coherence in nonadiabatic pathways to control light-harvesting and photoluminescence properties. Aim 1: Prepare CdSe QDs with a range of surface-capping ligands intended to vary the mode of bonding and coupling to the core wavefunction, and then characterize the surface coordination before and after exchange of ligands using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Aim 2. Determine the impact of QD–ligand bonding character on hot carrier cooling and quantum beating using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. Aim 3. Determine the mechanisms that promote hot carrier cooling in QDs at the atomistic level. The preliminary results provide the first evidence that coherent vibronic wavepacket motions involving mid-frequency modes of the surface ligands control the rate of cooling of carrier states to the band edge by a nonadiabatic mechanism. An important implication of these findings is that the QDs present an opportunity to learn how the structural features of an energy material can be manipulated to optimize its function through control of its coherence properties."

Economic, political, and ecological pressures have hastened the global transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) to electric vehicles (EVs). In response, automakers are investing over $300 billion to accelerate the launch of EVs. However, to realize mass-market adoption of EVs, lower-cost batteries with higher energy density are urgently needed. Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are the single most costly component of an EV, sometimes approaching 25 to 30% of the vehicle cost. EV producers have shown profitability, not on the EVs produced, but through other financial means, such as the sale of carbon credits. To achieve profitability of the EV’s themselves, improvements to today’s LiB’s are needed to reduce costs, improve driving range, and reduce dependence on increasingly hard to obtain materials (cobalt). There is, therefore, an urgent need for new high-performance cathode materials that use low-cost, abundant raw materials. Many next-generation cathode materials, including nickel (Ni)-rich LiNi1- xMn0.5xCo0.5xO2 (NMC with x = 0.2) layered oxide cathode that has attracted great interest due to its high specific energy, suffer from detrimental electrolyte reactions at high operating voltages from the catalytic activity of nickel at high state-of-charge (SOC). This results in poor cycle life that limits their commercial adoption. The technology that Nexceris and The Ohio State University (OSU) are working to develop focuses on the enormous market opportunity for new materials innovations that address these safety and cycle-life challenges that are slowing the roll-out of nickel-rich NMC cathodes. In Phase I Nexceris and OSU demonstrated two extremely promising product concepts that significantly improve the capacity and cycle life of nickel-rich cathodes. In the proposed Phase II effort, the commercial readiness of these product concepts will be advanced, and the performance enhancement demonstrated in large 2-Ah cells."

This problem is clear today in the hydropower industry, for water allocation managers, and is becoming more acute for conservation organizations as ecosystem protection grows in complexity. These groups rely on forecasts for planning and operational decision-making, but shortcomings in current forecasts hamper decision makers’ ability to plan operations, prepare for extreme weather events and climatic shifts, and protect ecological services. The overall objective of the Phase I and proposed Phase II project is to advance the technical and commercialization of a novel hydrologically-guided machine learning approach to predict streamflow. Through integration of near real-time satellite basin data, weather forecasts, and on-the-ground observed data, the model delivers forecasts with demonstrated accuracy using a cloud-based system that is scalable, resilient, and secure. In Phase I, an initial prototype was transformed into a fully operational system and commercialized for a cohort of initial customers. The three main accomplishments from Phase I were: 1) built, tested, and implemented a distributed neural network model that creates accurate forecasts in large ( > 20,000 mi2) basins; 2) demonstrated the added value in accuracy that results from including multiple weather forecast sources as parallel model inputs; and 3) operationalized an evaluation system such that experimental model versions can be easily compared with competitors’ models and alternative methods. During Phase I, operational forecasts were deployed at 36 points. The Phase II objectives build on findings from Phase I, and broadly aim to: (1) increase accuracy by including additional weather forecast sources that span the short-term and seasonal products, (2) quantify the model’s financial benefits over alternative approaches to communicate the return on investment with target customers, and (3) build out commercial scalability of the model system and delivery methods. Achievement of these objectives will enable and accompany a concerted business effort to scale from the initial cohort of customers by integrating results from (2) and (3) into the product marketing strategy. In the short-term, three user groups will benefit from the technology: hydropower entities will optimize generation and operate safely, helping transition the grid to renewable sources while reducing their environmental impact and increasing revenues; water regulators will make data-informed allocation decisions; and conservation organizations will prioritize restoration projects more effectively."

Algal blooms develop due to excess nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, discharged from wastewater treatment plants, agricultural and other point and non-point sources. Both nitrogen and phosphorus contribute to algal blooms, but it is generally recognized that phosphorus is the main driver in algal bloom formation, as N2-fixing cyanobacteria can provide nitrogen where limiting. Microalgae can accumulate phosphorus and reduce extracellular concentration to very low levels—a few micrograms per liter. The overall Phase I/Phase II approach is to grow conditioned microalgae in controlled pond systems, so that phosphorus can be removed rapidly at the source, thus combining economically and sustainably clean water with biofuels generation. To address environmental pollution, legal levels of nitrogen and phosphorus that can be released into surface waters are being reduced nationwide. Many municipal wastewater treatment plants are not designed to meet these new nutrient-discharge limits and will be forced to completely replace or significantly retrofit their existing treatment systems, often costing the municipality millions of dollars. This situation has created a need for alternative technologies such as MBE’s innovative Phosphorus Uptake and Recovery with Algae (PURA™) system, which is designed to be simply and affordably retrofitted to a municipality’s existing wastewater treatment infrastructure to meet the new discharge limits. MBE and its partner California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) are developing a first-in-class, algae-based wastewater treatment process to achieve virtually zero phosphorus emission from wastewater. Our game changing PURA™ process will not only eliminate P pollution at the source, but it could also be deployed to mitigate existing environmental pollution. This is possible, because we fight phosphorus pollution with algae. In Phase I, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for conditioning suspended filamentous algae to remove P within hours from wastewater and then harvest by using low-cost screens. In Phase II, we will create a prototype to demonstrate reliability, affordability and sustainability of PURA™. The algal biomass created in our process can be used for products such as biostimulants, biofertilizers, bioplastics and biofuels for a circular green economy. Customers for our technology are indeed in pain: due to the increasing damage of algal blooms nationwide, with southern states and Florida being only the recent ground zero for these problems, there is increasing regulatory and political pressure for wastewater treatment plants and other identifiable sources of nutrient pollution, and in particular phosphorus, to reduce effluent levels to 0.05 ppm and even lower levels. Currently available technologies do not meet the dual requirements of technical and economic feasibility."

Warm dense matter plasmas experience strongly-coupled interactions, where ions feel the presence of their nearest neighbors as electron shielding begins to deteriorate. In this regime, the energy needed to ionize an atom is not unique, but also depends strongly on the local environment. The project seeks to develop a framework for simulating these fast discharges and to validate these simulations with experiments at pressures as high as 50 bar. The plasma production will be augmented to even higher levels of plasma density with second-stage picosecond laser heating."

Our recent studies of Chlamydomonas triose-phosphate and malate/oxaloacetate transporters (TPTs and OMTs, respectively) show that null mutants for some of them are unable to survive high light conditions that wild type cells thrive in, consistent with roles for these transporters in metabolite export from the chloroplast, redox balancing, and net photosynthetic performance. Our primary hypotheses are: i) oxaloacetate, malate, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), and glyceraldehyde phosphate (GAP) form the core of electron exchange between compartments of photosynthetic cells; ii) TPTs and OMTs are critical components of the machinery that exports these electron-carrying metabolites from Chlamydomonas chloroplasts; iii) distinct TPT/OMT isoforms are localized to the envelope membranes of chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes, facilitating the shuttling of electron-carrying metabolites among these organelles; iv) redox exchange by these metabolite shuttles is critical for Chlamydomonas stress tolerance and the integration of the cell’s metabolic networks in both the light and dark and; v) that the five Chlamydomonas malate dehydrogenase (MDH) isoforms have different redox-balancing functions that are reflected by their subcellular locations and their substrate specificities/preferences.

Previous research has emphasized how aerosol — particularly microphysically active cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) — influences radiative or precipitation processes, but the ways in which precipitation and other processes (e.g., entrainment) in turn influence the CCN field have been comparatively less studied. We propose a coordinated observational and modeling investigation to improve fundamental understanding of cloud processing of aerosol and how these processes are parameterized in models. This proposal is highly aligned with the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) research goal of employing Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (DOE ARM) data in observational and modeling studies to improve process-level understanding of ACPIs. Our proposal has two coordinated research thrusts to address this objective: 1. Observationally estimating CCN processing. The rich array of data from the DOE Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) surface observations and surface-based retrievals, aircraft flights from the recent ACE–ENA field campaign, satellite retrievals, and reanalysis will be combined in a mixed-layer-model (MLM) framework to quantify the dominant terms governing the MBL CCN budget and how this behavior depends upon cloud properties, synoptic context, and season. 2. Using large-eddy simulation (LES) with size-resolving (bin) microphysics to evaluate current CCN-processing assumptions and develop new parameterizations. Bin-microphysics LES will be constrained by ARM surface and aircraft observations to quantify aerosol cloud processing rates and the dominant mechanisms governing aerosol evolution. This will be done in a Lagrangian framework and in such a way to promote consistent comparisons with the Eulerian-framework (fixed) ENA observations. Model results will be analyzed by 1. using a MLM framework similar to that applied to the observational data; 2. applying a machine-learning random-forest approach to rank the dominant microphysical properties governing CCN processing; and 3. developing new functional forms (parameterizations) of CCN processing by cloud. Objectives 1 and 2 are linked through the application of the stochastic collection equation from the LES on aircraft drop size distributions, and the consistent use of a MLM approach for both observations and LES. This research will make special use of ACE–ENA field observations, the PI team’s well-established approaches for classifying synoptic regime, and extensive experience with spectral-bin LES. The focus on the evaluation of current CCN processing approaches in ESMs, together with an active development of new parameterizations, is likely to yield substantial short-term (< 5 years) impacts for ESM models like DOE ACME (Accelerated Climate Modeling for Energy Project). The research is aligned with one of the five WCRP grand challenges (Coupling Clouds to Circulations; http://www.wcrp-climate.org/index.php/gc-clouds) and the ongoing DOE Artificial Intelligence for Earth System Predictability (AI4ESP) effort to apply machine learning approaches (here, self-organizing maps and regression tree analysis) to large, multi-dimensional observational and modeling datasets. Expected outcomes of the research are 1. improving understanding of the factors governing cloud processing of CCN in the MBL across seasons and synoptic regimes; 2. gaining new process-level insights into the CCN-processing component of ACPIs, as illuminated from LES with spectral representations of droplets and CCN; and 3. developing a new parameterization of CCN processing and uncertainty that is independent of existing autoconversion and accretion parameterizations."

For molecules that can access multiple spin states, these spin properties can be exploited for use as sensors or molecular switches. The spin-coupling in the heaviest elements, the f-block, is among the most challenging to model due to the prevalence of such interactions. In addition to using modeling to design new molecules, results from the state-of-the-art computational methods used in this work can be used to assess the reliability of more affordable methods. Through comparisons with experiment, this work can assist with the development of the next generation of theoretical tools by quantifying if and when today’s methods breakdown. Since the 5f-elements often present with multiconfigurational electronic structures and large spin–orbit effects, modeling the electronic structure, molecular geometries, and vibrational spectra of larger systems containing actinides with more accurate methods than commonly used will provide new insights into spin properties and bonding. Improved descriptions of the behavior of f-electrons will be achieved by 1) computing structural properties, 2) predicting spectra, and 3) and accounting for strong correlation and spin–orbit coupling using methods based on the complete active space approach. Modeling will include optimizing geometries and performing vibrational analysis with second-order multireference methods followed by relativistic electronic structure studies using analogous methods based on the Dirac equation.

Hagan, Brandeis University (Principal Investigator) Seth Fraden, Brandeis University (Co-Investigator) Pengyu Hong, Brandeis University (Co-Investigator) Zvonimir Dogic, University of California Santa Barbara (Co-Investigator) Biological cells exhibit remarkable functionalities, such as motility, division, and self-healing. A cell achieves these capabilities by controlling three-dimensional patterns of forces generated within the cellular cytoskeleton. Reproducing such life-like self-regulating dynamics in synthetic materials remains a grand challenge. Addressing this challenge has the potential to advance our understanding of non-equilibrium physics and revolutionize engineering. Active materials, which are constructed from energy-consuming components, provide a promising platform to accomplish this goal. In contrast to traditional equilibrium materials, the energy-consuming microscopic elements of active materials generate internal forces and stresses that drive spontaneous large-scale motion, a tantalizingly life-like feature. However, the internal forces of an active material undergo multiple levels of hierarchical organization, spanning scales from individual molecules to the whole cell, leading to diverse dynamical behaviors such as turbulent flows, bulk contraction, and liquid-like phase separation. The different dynamical states frequently coexist and are highly sensitive to initial and boundary conditions. This inherently variable dynamics has prevented designing active materials to perform useful functions. Biology developed intricate self-regulation schemes to ensure that the cytoskeleton adopts a desired dynamical state from among the diverse set of all possible states. Thus, the critical need in active matter is to develop robust protocols to channel the hierarchical organization of active forces toward a predetermined dynamical state with useful functions. To achieve this goal, we will pursue three complementary objectives with the aim of developing machine learning (ML) based real-time feedforward and feedback protocols that control the structure and dynamics of 3D active materials: (Objective 1) Develop model-free control protocols that redirect active materials to targeted functional dynamics, (Objective 2) Develop model-predictive control protocols that redirect active materials to target states and dynamics, and (Objective 3) Use data-driven approaches to improve models for active materials. The first two objectives respectively use purely data-driven ML and physics-based algorithms to develop control protocols. The third objective leverages the powerful ability of ML algorithms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies from large data sets, and transfers this knowledge to the physics domain to gain new insights and improve models that underpin control algorithms. The ML methodologies are enabled by recent critical advances in developing 3D active materials made by the PIs. While most real-world applications require 3D materials, the vast majority of active matter studies have focused on 2D systems. Our algorithms will be developed and tested on large data sets acquired from three novel 3D active matter systems with increasing complexity, while exploring different ranges of dynamical structures: (A) a 3D active isotropic fluid, comprised of an isotropic 3D network of extensile bundles of microtubules, and powered by molecular motors; (B) a 3D active nematic, comprised of force-generating extensile microtubule bundles uniformly suspended in a passive nematic liquid crystal, and (C) a 3D active composite, an active network comprised of a network of extensile microtubule bundles immersed in a passive viscoelastic network of actin filaments. This work will provide robust protocols for controlling active materials in 3D, which is an essential step to develop a new class of materials with functionalities such as autonomous motion, self-assembly, replication, and self-healing. At the same time, analysis of our control solutions and ML-guided advances in theoretical models will lead to new insights into the fundamental physics of active materials; in particular, the relationship between spatiotemporal stress patterns and the flows that they generate."

The overarching goal of this Bluestone project is to enable new levels of performance portability of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications on extremely heterogeneous (EH) architectures. Given the current trends toward architectural diversification, any software developers that strive for performance portability of their software will need improved techniques, including program synthesis, that hide the increasing complexity of emerging EH architectures. There are two key challenges for performance portability: (1) improved code generation and synthesis for EH devices on single node and across multiple EH architectures, and (2) effective run time scheduling of computation while accounting for device heterogeneity, locality, and data orchestration. Approach. Our project, named Bluestone, will take the approach of improving both the code genera- tion and run time systems by employing program synthesis techniques, including AI, constraint solving, SMT/SAT, and symbolic methods. To achieve these goals, our Bluestone project will integrate and build on several established components: (a) the LLVM/MLIR compiler ecosystem; (b) the SnowWhite high-level reasoning engine; and (c) the IRIS heterogeneous run time system. We will initially target HPC and AI ap- plications on three relevant platforms of interest to DOE: Summit (IBM and NVIDIA), Frontier (AMD), and Aurora (Intel). Concurrently, we will focus on emerging architectures including FPGAs, systems on a chip (SoCs) (e.g., Qualcomm Snapdragon), and quantum devices via QASM.

Galli, University of Chicago (Co-Investigator) Understanding the transport and deposition of platinum group elements (PGEs), critical to societal needs and advancement, in geological fluids at the molecular level is a priority area of DOE. The overall objective of this project is to understand the properties and processes responsible for the migration and enrichment of two platinum group elements (platinum and palladium) in magmatic and hydrothermal environments. This project will advance critical minerals and materials research aligned with the BES mission by providing a fundamental molecular understanding of PGE transport and deposition. PGEs are considered critical elements as they are essential commodities for many electronic and automotive industries. Their high melting points, corrosion resistance and catalytic qualities make them critical for many industrial applications. Natural geochemical and petrologic processes have concentrated these metals in extraordinarily rare, but very rich, ore deposits that can be exploited for extraction. Approximately 90% of PGEs produced to date have come from Russia and South Africa. Understanding fundamental aspects of how PGE deposits form is critical for discovering new deposits of these elements and improving extraction of them. However, the processes forming PGE ore deposits are still in dispute. A fundamental molecular understanding of the magmatic and hydrothermal fluids that play a role in the transport, concentration, and deposition of the PGE is needed. The complexity of geologic fluids requires a comprehensive assessment of the way PGEs are transported by fluids. Yet, despite numerous advances, significant questions remain, particularly regarding the role of hot, aqueous fluids and how they might facilitate transport of PGEs. The project represents an integrated program of measurements, fundamental theory, and geochemical modeling to address how fluids transport PGEs. It will involve experimental solubility determinations of palladium and platinum sulfides in hydrous alkali silicate liquids ranging from melts to hydrous fluids at high temperatures and pressures. The resulting experiments will be examined using synchrotron radiation to understand the chemical bonding environment of these elements. Molecular dynamics calculations of atom behavior will be integrated with spectroscopy to strengthen interpretations about the mechanisms by which alkali silicate liquids solubilize PGE sulfides. Solubilities will be incorporated into thermodynamic models of aqueous silicate and carbonate systems in geologic systems, expanding the Deep Earth Water (DEW) model. Equations of state for the free energies of the high temperature/pressure metal-silicate or sulfide complexes will be calibrated using the experimental results and integrated with published low temperature and pressure experimental solubilities. The project will test hypotheses for the origin and evolution of PGE-bearing complex natural fluids using chemical mass transfer models to compare with natural systems and observed Pt/Pd differences. Finally, the project will involve collaboration with the European synchrotron facility leading to knowledge transfer for developing autoclave/cell for future hydrothermal work at the Advanced Photon Source. The result of the project will be a geochemical model consistent with experimental data and molecular studies providing a unified framework that can be extrapolated to a wide range of temperatures and pressures to address fundamental questions of interest to the geoscience of critical elements that could not previously be considered. By enabling quantitative predictive geochemical modelling of the behavior of PGE-bearing fluid-rock interactions in the Earth, the model will impact our understanding of how the PGEs are transported and concentrated in nature, as well as providing a quantitative framework to aid in modeling the chemical properties of these critical elements in industrial processes."

The objective of this proposed research is to exploit an energetically-inexpensive electrostatic charge transfer mechanism for the capture and release of CO2 in a reversible and controllable fashion at modified electrode surfaces. The concept is based on harnessing the polarizing effect of an electrode surface to capture CO2. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that modulation of the reactivity of surface-confined CO2 binding agents will permit the on-demand capture and release of CO2 for its effective separation from air. This approach improves the functionality of CO2 capture media through electrochemical methods, creating the opportunity for integration of DAC to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy. This proposal introduces an alternative and highly selective energy transfer mechanism for DAC of CO2 that has the potential to dramatically decrease the energetic expenditure compared to state-of-the-art thermochemical approaches. This project aligns with the mission of DOE-BES to lay the foundations of new energy technologies via exploration of basic chemical principles, and it also responds to the Priority Research Directions (PRDs) as outlined in the “Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020 Basic Research Needs” including the identification of new interfacial processes and chemistries with controllable kinetics and stimuli-responsive materials under alternative driving forces. To investigate the hypothesis, the project will undertake the following thrusts: 1) synthesizing attachment chemistries and characterizing their CO2 binding, 2) exploring the impact of nanoconfinement on modified porous electrodes, and 3) computationally modeling and predicting CO2 binding characteristics. These thrusts will enable both a deep and practical understanding of the scientific principles underpinning the proposed technology. The team builds on a combined expertise in electrode modification, spectroelectrochemistry, interfacial analysis, computational physical chemistry, and electrochemical phenomena in porous electrodes to successfully carry out the proposed work.

Multi-Metalloporphyrin Synthetic Polymers for Long-Range Charge Transport,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022035,"Moore, Jeffrey",Jeffrey.Moore@boardoftrusteesoftheuniversityofillinois,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","The broad objective of this research is to acquire knowledge on the design of polymer molecules that efficiently transport charge. Synthetic polymers that are good charge transporters are typically structured such that electrons delocalize over the entire length of the polymer molecule. In contrast, biological systems called bacterial nanowires transport charge without having extended electron delocalization. Synthetic materials that function like bacterial nanowires would greatly advance the ability to produce scalable, functional materials that are easily processed and have broad applications. The research team at the University of Illinois will use computational modeling, polymer synthesis, structural characterization, and single-molecule charge transport measurements to understand and control long-range charge transport in synthetic polymers by mimicking bacterial nanowires. The project will test the hypothesis that charge transport is primarily governed by the spacing, orientation, and dynamics of the redox centers, and secondarily by the intervening molecular environment. The research approach involves studying three families of polymers that progressively gain charge-transport function through structural variations. These three families are: (i) polymer-peptide conjugates, (ii) polymer-metalloporphyrin conjugates, and (iii) peptide-metalloporphyrin polymers. The findings will inform the design of scalable and manufacturable materials for energy harvesting, transduction, and storage."

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely studied to address various challenges of productively and efficiently running scientific applications on supercomputers. These approaches are limited, however, because it is extremely difficult to generate, access, and maintain high-quality training data needed to drive ML-based research. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a generic High Performance Computing data management framework (named HPC-FAIR) to make both training data and AI models of scientific applications findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. In particular, we will focus on the following innovations: 1) collecting and generating a set of representative training data and AI models; 2) developing program pattern analysis and translation tools to augment, correlate and annotate data from multiple sources; 3) designing an internal representation (called Data IR) for representing both training data and AI models; 4) providing easy access and user interfaces; and 5) studying a workflow synthesizer to automatically convert user queries into optimized sequences of data processing function calls. The outcome of the proposed project is anticipated to fundamentally improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of both training data and AI models, thereby driving innovation in AI and ML. The datasets and AI models from HPC-FAIR will also serve as common baselines to quickly, consistently, and fairly evaluate new AI models for quality, complexity, and overhead. While we pick the example domain of analyzing and optimizing scientific applications, the developed techniques will be directly applicable to manage datasets and AI models for any other scientific domains."

We will demonstrate the ability to connect incisive observation and high fidelity models to understand and predict reactivity, through validated microkinetic modeling approaches that capture in physically appropriate ways the influence of reaction environment on observed reactivity. We will exercise those models to predict catalyst/reaction condition combinations that optimize performance at conditions of interest. The program will be organized around four primary research pillars: Coverage-aware microkinetics We will develop microkinetic mean-field and lattice-based Monte Carlo models, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and innovative approaches to incorporate coverage dependence into those models, to predict NH3 oxidation rates, rate orders, and selectivities as a function of reaction conditions, catalytic material and morphology. We will develop well-validated and efficient approaches for incorporating cover dependence in microkinetic models that are transferable to other problems. These models will inform experimental evaluations of thermal NH3 oxidation. NH3 oxidation kinetics We will prepare well-defined, supported metal catalysts, will collect full kinetic data (rates, selectivities, reaction orders) on these materials, and develop a complete baseline NH3 oxidation reference that relates materials and conditions to reaction selectivity. These results will provide a well-defined baseline against which to evaluate the modifying influences of plasmas. We will exercise validated models to predict materials (composition, structure, reaction conditions) that have superior NH3 oxidation rates and avoid undesirable N2O production. Characterizations We will use incisive characterization techniques to interrogate catalyst state and observe critical intermediates during NH3 oxidation reactions, in the absence and with the presence of plasma stimulation. We will design and develop an in-house in situ/operando transmission infrared spectroscopy cell capable of operating in the presence of a non-thermal plasma (NTP). These and complementary inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) will allow us to observe adsorbate species at conditions representative of catalytic reactivity. We will use the DFT models to assign and interpret these spectra, and use the results as a further test of the reliability of the microkinetic model predictions of surface species. NTP-modified NH3 oxidation We will elaborate the coverage-dependent microkinetic models to incorporate the potential influence of plasma stimulation on NH3 oxidation rates and selectivities, incorporating potential influences of the NTP on reactants and consequent influence on catalytic reactivity. We will observe the catalytic consequences of plasma stimulation over a range of conditions, to develop a rich set of high quality reaction data to quantify and confirm any influence of NTP on observed changes in reactivity, to evaluate models, and to provide a basis for identifying the primary mechanisms responsible for observed NTP-promoted NH3 oxidation. Completion of these tasks will simultaneously enhance DFT models for catalytic activity at metal surfaces, advance the state of knowledge of environmentally significant oxidative nitrogen chemistry, and place plasma-stimulated catalysis on a firmer scientific footing."
Probing Ultrafast Charge Transfer Dynamics in Heterostructured Nanomaterials,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021062,"Vura-Weis, Joshua",Joshua.Vura-Weis@boardoftrusteesoftheuniversityofillinois,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","The increasing demand for renewable and low-cost energy has triggered a vast amount of research aimed at developing, characterizing and optimizing chemical and solid-state systems that can efficiently convert sun light into useful chemical energy in the form of electricity or chemical fuels. A promising recent approach for third-generation solar cells is to replace metal-organic dyes, employed in dye-sensitized solar cells, by purely inorganic substances with strong optical absorption characteristics and extended long-term stability. So-called quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have gained much attention in recent years based on the advantageous physicochemical properties of semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) as sensitizers, as well as their promising potential to increase the conversion efficiency beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit of 33% by making use of hot-electron transfer (HET) routes and multiple exciton generation (MEG). By finely tuning the size of the QDs, the band gap can be carefully aligned to the metal oxide (MO) conduction band such that charge transfer from the photoexcited QD is thermodynamically favorable. Despite extensive research on QDSCs, several key questions remain unanswered and the mechanisms of ultrafast charge transfer phenomena are heavily debated. This research project aims at resolving these pertaining questions by elucidating the time scales and mechanistic origins of the crucial steps of photoinduced interfacial charge separation and adverse carrier trapping and recombination routes in chemically linked and epitaxially grown PbX/TiO2 and CdX/TiO2 (X = S, Se) heterostructured nanosystems. The project will take the form of the following specific objectives: (1) Establish the first direct element-specific probing of (hot) electron/hole dynamics, and unambiguous disentanglement of all relaxation processes; (2) Identification and atomic-scale characterization of electron/hole trap sites in the acceptor and donor moieties; (3) Determination of the structural changes associated with interfacial charge transfer and testing theoretical electron transfer models for heterostructured nanomaterials; (4) Comparing the charge transfer dynamics between chemically linked and epitaxially connected QD/MO systems and exploring the factors favoring HET routes in these systems. Our experimental approach is based on various forms of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy (XAS, HERFD, and RIXS), in conjunction with X-ray scattering and ultrafast laser spectroscopy, implemented at synchrotron and X-FEL facilities. Ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy is ideal to fulfill the above-listed objectives since it is element-specific such that charge density changes and structural distortions in the donor and acceptor moieties can be followed selectively, and it delivers not only the local geometric structure of the system under study (by means of EXAFS), but also the underlying electronic structure changes (using XANES). Furthermore, its time resolution (~70 ps at synchrotrons, ~100 fs at X-FELs) is ideal to study charge transfer processes in the weak- and strongly-coupled electron transfer regimes, respectively. We will employ full multiple scattering calculations, in combination with time-dependent DFT, to infer the coupled electronic and structural dynamics upon photoexcitation from the time-resolved X-ray spectra and scattering patterns. The results from these studies, if successful, will lead to a detailed fundamental understanding of the factors driving photoinduced electron transfer in QDSCs and will enable the identification of ways to improve the efficiency of quantum dot based solar cell devices."

Schadler, University of Vermont (Principle Investigator) Sanat K. Kumar, Columbia University (Co-Investigator) Brian C. Benicewicz, University of South Carolina (Co-Investigator) Composites consisting of spherical nanoparticles and a polymer matrix have shown considerable promise for improving the mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of polymers. One of the critical factors in achieving the properties is controlling how the nanoparticles are organized in the polymer matrix. Most prior work has focused on organizing nanoparticles in amorphous polymers, but 70% of all polymers sold annually are semicrystalline. Inspired by this apparent disconnect, our work in the current DOE funded grant and this renewal proposal employs a novel handle, polymer crystallization, to organize NPs in semicrystalline polymers. We have found that by changing the rate of crystallization, we can control whether the nanoparticles are well dispersed, or are pushed in between the crystalline regions to form sheets of particles in the amorphous regions. We hypothesize that the isothermal crystallization rate and the nanoparticle diffusivity, are the two relevant control parameters in this context. We have established the broad applicability of this approach in two polymers, polyethylene (PE) and polyethyleneoxide (PEO). To achieve this goal we developed a method for attaching (grafting) long PE chains from NPs with controlled graft density and molecular weight, giving us the ability to tailor their dispersion in the PE melt prior to crystallization. In this renewal proposal, we will develop the fundamental, quantitative understanding that will allow us to independently tailor polymer crystallization rate, NP diffusivity and NP agglomeration state in semicrystalline polymers so as to facilely control NP ordering and hence properties. More specifically we will focus on three areas: 1. Quantifying the relationship between particle diffusivity (by altering the grafted chain density and molecular weight, and by using a bimodal population of brushes on the NP) and the critical crystallization rate. 2. Manipulating crystallization rates by controlling graft chemistry: We have found that the stereoregularity of the grafted chains is critical in controlling the crystallization rate. Apparently, crystalline grafts can co-crystallize with the matrix and speed crystallization kinetics; amorphous grafts on the other hand hinder crystallization. In addition, by organizing the fillers in the melt, we have shown we can alter the nucleation and crystallization rate when the sample is cooled below its melting point. Understanding the fundamentals of both these phenomena is critical to controlling NP organization and therefore properties. 3. Zone Annealing: Manufacturing protocols require that polymers are extruded and then directionally crystallized in the presence of flow (and temperature) gradients. To mimic these practically more relevant synthesis protocols, we have designed a flow setup, modeled on the zone annealing (ZA) method to directionally solidify polymer nanocomposites. As expected, this protocol yields spherulites that are elongated in the flow direction. We will develop an understanding of how flow induced orientation impacts the crystallinity (initial results suggest it is higher) as well as use it as a method to create larger scale alignment of the lamella (and thus the filler sheets)."

The presence of solvating molecules introduces specific interactions among solvent molecules, catalyst surfaces, and reactive species that can change turnover rates and selectivities when different solvents are implemented for catalytic reactions, such as hydrogen transfer, alkene oligomerization, coupling reactions, and selective oxidations to name a few. These complex interactions couple fast, short range electron transfer and transformations at active sites to slower, long range changes in the solvent structure. Intuition for the effects of solvents on chemical reactions exists; however, these heuristics do not account for surfaces and often fail for heterogeneous catalysts. This research will quantify the impact and elucidate the molecular motifs of solvent-mediated interactions between reactive species and the extended surface of solid catalysts, which will provide new approaches for engineering solid-liquid interfaces for selective catalytic reactions. These effects can be used to increase turnover rates and selectivities for liquid-phase alkene epoxidations in porous materials by orders of magnitude and depend on the surface topology about catalytically active sites; the size and hydrogen bonding nature of the solvent; and the specific interactions of the solvent with reactive intermediates on the surface. Knowledge generated in this work will show how catalytic rates and selectivities depend on coupling between solvent dynamics and surface kinetics and how these processes are impacted by the extended surface of the solid catalyst, beyond the active site. Ultimately this will provide broad insight for how solvents faciliate catalysis at surfaces and yield potentially transformative principles to engineer solid-liquid interfaces for catalytic conversion of domestic resources, including light hydrocarbons and renewable biomass."

Perovskite solar cells have recently shown significant increases in their power conversion efficiency but suffer from environmental degradation that limits their performance lifetime, manufacturing processes not amenable to rapid large-scale production, and relatively high cost per watt. We are working with a major research university to address these lifetime, manufacturing and cost issues by developing new and low-cost perovskite solar cell materials, novel cell architectures and electrospray deposition techniques that allow rapid and large-scale reel-to-reel fabrication. During the Phase I program, we performed materials research to 1) demonstrate new perovskite processing methods that overcome environmental degradation and lead to performance lifetimes approaching one year, and 2) create new simpler two-layer cells that eliminate the need for expensive hole transport layer materials and reduce cost by ninety percent. The modified perovskite cells can be fabricated completely using electrospray deposition in an open manufacturing environment, significantly decreasing production complexity and increasing throughput. Fabrication process research demonstrated deposition methods that can be transitioned to reel-to- reel production during Phase II. During the Phase II program, we will build on this work to develop and scale-up the production volumes of the perovskite solar cell materials and use these materials to produce and evaluate the performance of test cells. A commercial-scale reel-to-reel production system will be designed and built with assistance from a manufacturing machinery design company and used to produce interconnected cell arrays. Both indoor laboratory equipment and an outdoor testbed will be used to evaluate power conversion efficiency and long-term performance stability. There are many commercial market applications for flexible and lightweight, high power conversion efficiency and long-lifetime perovskite solar cell replacements to bulky, fragile lower efficiency silicon photovoltaic panels, and a significant manufacturing opportunity. The global market for photovoltaics is estimated to grow from $54 billion in 2018 to $334 billion in 2026 with a compound annual growth rate greater than 25%. The most significant commercial applications are in large-scale renewable energy solar farms to power the nation’s electrical grid, and local industrial and residential arrays. Other uses include powering solar lamps, parking meters, emergency telephones, trash compactors, temporary traffic signs, charging stations, and remote guard posts and signals. They also offer a lower cost option than new electric lines for providing power to remote locations."

Understanding the principles and mechanisms employed by photosynthetic organisms to harvest the energy of light will eventually lead to the construction of artificial biomimetic devices that could generate energy in the most environmentally friendly and efficient fashion. While the general principles governing the light energy conversion in photosynthetic processes are well understood, our knowledge of the details of electronic structure and energy/electron transfer dynamics is often ambiguous in spite of extensive experimental and theoretical work. This research will combine recently developed nanosecond and femtosecond time-resolved circular dichroism (TRCD) spectroscopies and synergistic molecular modeling to study photosynthetic proteins. The added ability to differentiate kinetic optical signals not only by their absorptive and temporal signatures, but also based on the circular dichroism (CD) properties of the molecules involved in energy and electron transfer enables resolving electronic states that otherwise cannot be distinguished by conventional experimental methods. The first-principles modeling of the same systems will greatly benefit interpretation of new experimental data. At the same time, the experimental data will provide crucial constraints to the development of predictive computational methods that will enable untangling the properties of complex pigment-protein proteins from their structure with no other input from experiment. This synergetic approach will be applied to the studies of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex (FMO), which has traditionally served as a test ground for new experimental and computational techniques. Each protein subunit of this homotrimeric complex embeds eight strongly interacting bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) pigments. In spite of numerous studies, the energetic assignment of these pigments remains ambiguous – a number of different Hamiltonians have been proposed over years that are consistent with experimental data. The use of the TRCD technique complemented with the first-principles modeling will enable resolving this ambiguity and, at the same time, advancing both the novel experimental technique and computational methods that could be applied to other pigment-protein complexes in the future. The project also aims at applying the TRCD spectroscopy and first-principles modeling to study electron transfer dynamics in the reaction center (RC) of photosystem I (PS I). PS I is one of the major players in the photosynthetic process of all plants, algae and cyanobacteria. However, while PS I has been extensively studied over past decades, the initial steps of the electron transfer process in this complex remain a subject of debate. This is because the electron transfer among the few Chls forming the RC is buried under much stronger signals stemming from the excitation energy transfer in 90 other Chls of PS I. As the result, kinetic constants of the initial electron transfer steps have not been unambiguously determined, and even the nature of the primary electron donor remains a subject of discussion. The use of TRCD proposed in the current research will enable direct observation of the dynamics of the primary charge separation in PS I and shed light on these long-standing questions. The newly developed TRCD technique and computational protocols are expected to benefit broad range of applications such as studies of photosynthesis, protein dynamics and molecular electronics."

Where appropriate, calculations will also be performed on lanthanide (""4f"") analogs. The project focuses on magnetic field-induced circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of 5f metal complexes, their absorption spectra at X-ray wavelengths (XAS), the calculation of vibrationally resolved (VR) electronic spectra, the calculation of 237Np Mössbauer spectra, and the analysis of chemical bonding trends in the actinide series. Calculations of nuclear magnetic and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic parameters, nuclear quadrupole resonance parameters, and the molecular paramagnetic susceptibility, will also be carried out as needed. These properties will be calculated from first principles quantum theory and analyzed, to understand how they relate to molecular structure, and to the chemical bonding in the electronic ground state and in the excited states. The different magnetic and spectroscopic properties are affected in different ways by structure and bonding, and therefore they reveal complementary information. A major goal of the project is the prediction and analysis of magnetic and spectroscopic properties for radioactive actinide complexes encountered in nuclear waste, in ground water (e.g. actinide carbonate complexes), and in other forms. Experimental magnetic and quadrupole resonance, Mössbauer, MCD, and XAS spectra of such systems can be very difficult to interpret without theoretical support. The theoretical studies in this project will reveal a wealth of information on how the chemical behavior and chemical transformations of actinide compounds can be monitored via their magnetic and spectroscopic properties. The project involves development and applications of quantum-chemistry methods for the study of the properties of so-called open-shell metal complexes, which have unpaired electrons. This is a frontier in quantum chemistry. A crucial aspect of these computational methods is their ability to describe open-shell metal complexes with thermally accessible magnetic electronic states. Part of the project's efforts are directed at developing new theoretical methods to render calculations of the magnetic and spectroscopic properties of open-shell actinide complexes feasible in the first place, and to improve the accuracy of such calculations. A theoretical understanding of actinide-compound magnetic and quadrupole resonance, MCD, XAS, 237Np Mössbauer, and other magnetic and spectroscopic properties is a critical ingredient for the exploration of 5f-element chemistry by spectroscopic techniques. Many of the proposed types of computations have never been attempted. Beyond the specific outcomes of the computational studies proposed here, new quantum chemical development will be made available to the scientific community as part of widely utilized open-source quantum chemistry packages, for example NWChem and Molcas, and stand-alone open-source tools. NWChem and Molcas are state-of-the-art computational tools for f-element compounds. These developments will also have an impact beyond the actinide field because these programs are applicable to all types of molecules with elements across the periodic table.

In this proposal, X-wave Innovations, Inc. proposes a non-contact, wireless sensor system (NCWSS) capable of monitoring the internal conditions of stainless steel nuclear waste dry-storage canisters by placing a set of wireless sensors inside the canister and acquiring the measurement signals outside through the thick steel wall without any cable running through. The proposed NCWSS approach is based on XII-developed wireless power and signal transfer technologies. Our main objectives of the Phase I program are to prototype a NCWSS and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technique for long-term monitoring of internal conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, gas species) inside a sealed stainless steel canister and wirelessly interrogating data through the thick steel wall without direct connection. The proposed non-contact, wireless sensor system provides an in-situ, reliable, accurate, and low-cost sensor technology for remote, and long-term monitoring of the internal conditions of a spent nuclear fuel dry-storage canister. This sensor technology can also be used to monitor internal conditions and prevent catastrophic failure of pressure vessels of nuclear reactors, mission-critical components in aerospace vehicles, chemistry and oil refinement industry to improve the reliability, reduce maintenance costs, and extend the service life of those systems while maintaining their safety and reliability. Many other industries and government agencies dealing with structural condition/health monitoring will directly benefit from this sensor technology."

In Hawaii, these greenwaste streams can have strong community significance, as a small but significant amount of this green waste consists of invasive species cleared through community-led landscape restoration projects. These projects are painstaking efforts to restore Native Hawaiian cultural sites, endangered species habitats, and watersheds by restoring the tens of thousands of acres clear-cut for sugar cane plantations over the past century. With sugar now ended as an industry in Hawaii, most of these lands are now over-run by invasive species. How this problem is being addressed: We are developing an innovative integrated gasification and gas cleanup process to convert low-quality urban lignocellulosic biomass waste into cost-competitive green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. Our first commercial project would divert urban wood waste from a landfill located within an economically disadvantaged area surrounded by native Hawaiian Homestead lands and a high proportion of native Hawaiian residents. For this research we will focus on invasive species and green waste as an additional potential feedstock with community benefits, especially to native Hawaiian communities. Enough of this mixed tropical green waste is generated the island of Oahu alone to supply up to 20% of the feed for our commercial-scale gasification plant. Research focus for this Phase I: Our research objectives for this project include; Community-informed design of our SAF production plant and its upstream supply chain, with three spirals of community stakeholder perception studies and input into the design and development of a greenwaste feedstock collection model; Feedstock analysis and pre-processing trials: Analysis of physico-chemical characteristics, geographic frequency, volume, and variability of heterogeneous greenwaste; and physical trials to test different collection, size reduction, and drying methods; Workforce development and outreach, especially to native Hawaiian community members as this ethnic group is historically the most under-represented in STEM career fields; and Technoeconomic and community impact modeling to identify the optimal combination of commercial viability and community benefit. Our research partners for the stakeholder perception and community education and outreach include the University of Hawaii and non-profit Hawaiian community and landscape restoration organizations. Our desired outcome from this research is materials research and feedstock supply chain design that results in more sustainable opportunities for communities to maximize economic benefits, workforce opportunities for this under-represented group in STEM, and quality of life building through landscape restoration support in culturally responsive ways"

Lemkul, Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Tech (Co-Principal Investigator) Emily Mevers, Department of Chemistry, Virginia Tech (Co-Principal Investigator) Biswarup Mukhopadhyay, Department of Biochemistry, Virginia Tech (Co-Principal Investigator) The focus of this research is the nickel tetrapyrrole prosthetic group known as coenzyme F430, which is the central catalytic component of methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR). MCR catalyzes the final methane-forming step of methanogenesis in methanogenic archaea as well as the initial methane activation step for the anaerobic oxidation of methane in anaerobic methanotrophs. MCR holds great potential for use in sustainable and efficient biocatalytic approaches to produce valuable energy sources. Interestingly, MCR is the only enzyme with which coenzyme F430 is known to function, signifying that nature has evolved a specialized cofactor to catalyze complex methane conversions. Several chemical modifications to F430 have been discovered including two different thioether substituents and a vinyl sidechain. We propose that these F430 modifications have a role in fine-tuning the MCR active site to enhance catalytic efficiency, influence protein dynamics and stability, and/or to guide the directionality of the MCR reaction. This research will define and biochemically characterize the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of modified F430s as well as confirm the structures and locations of the modifications by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We will further provide insights into the growth conditions that promote the production of modified F430s in model methanogens as well as if and how the modifications influence MCR using in vivo and in silico approaches. Taken together, this work will uncover new aspects of MCR structure and function that could inform the design of optimized MCR-based catalysts for bioenergy applications."
Molecular Co-Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Redox Mediators,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022219,"Machan, Charles",Charles.Machan@therectorandvisitorsoftheuniversityofvirginia,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","The development of catalytic processes for the efficient conversion of CO2 to useful chemical precursors or fuels could result in a ‘closed loop’ for carbon, if emissions from combustion are converted back into reduced and high-energy small molecules using renewable sources. However, selectivity for specific reduction products from CO2 remains a significant challenge. Molecular catalysts can be selective for specific CO2 reduction products, but are often limited by modest activity. Therefore, new strategies to improve the activity of molecular electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction are required. The use of redox mediators (RMs) is a possible solution to improving the activity and scalability of molecular electrocatalysts. However, fundamental advancements in our understanding of activation and conversion strategies of CO2 are still required to realize this strategy. In reduction reactions, RMs co-catalytically direct electron equivalents to a substrate bound to an active site. We are investigating the use of RMs with molecular transition metal complexes for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to carbon monoxide (CO), using a combination of covalent and non-covalent interactions to drive bimolecular association. In these systems, the combination of covalent and non-covalent effects enhances the rate of co-catalyst association, improves the kinetic pathway by lowering the energy of key intermediates, and provides a new mechanism for directing electron equivalents to the active site. CO is a useful feedstock target of these efforts, as it has synthetic industrial applications in Fisher-Tropsch reactions, hydroformylation, and acetic acid production. Understanding how to efficiently utilize CO2 as a substrate for electrocatalysis to overcome the geographic and time dependence of renewable energy sources would be transformative for strategic energy usage. The development of RMs to enhance molecular electrocatalytic responses for the CO2 reduction reaction would represent a new contribution to the foundational knowledge of electrochemical reactions. We predict that our strategy of combining covalent and non-covalent effects will overcome the limitations of previous co-electrocatalytic approaches to CO2 reduction and lead to more rapid innovation in this area. This proposed research will address profound challenges for the field, with the goal of laying the groundwork for redefining how energy transduction systems can produce essential chemical streams from CO2 and, in the long-term, applied to the development of other co-electrocatalytic small molecule conversions."

Arnold, California Institute of Technology (Principal Investigator) T. Miller III, California Institute of Technology (Co-Investigator) Y. Yue, California Institute of Technology (Co-Investigator) Enzymes, the protein machines responsible for the remarkable chemistry of life, are efficient catalysts for chemical reactions that both construct and degrade molecules and materials. These biocatalysts are not just a part of our own survival as living beings, they also have extensive use in our global economy. Enzymes are used in everything from food preparation to laundry detergents, diagnosing and treating disease, and even producing the fuels and chemicals we need for our daily lives. Products and processes that use enzymes can be more cost-effective and ecologically friendly than current methods to do the same tasks. Enzymes can be produced in microorganisms grown in water and simple nutrients, and their reactions are compatible with aqueous environments that can be ecologically more friendly than the organic solvents used for many chemical transformations today. In 2018, the Nobel prize was awarded to PI Frances H. Arnold for methods of ""Directed Evolution"", which accelerated the development of these green biocatalysts and enabled unprecedented impact in industry. While directed evolution has helped enzymes become an integral part of our economy, the process of directed enzyme evolution requires extensive experimentation and can be expensive and slow. Enzyme engineers have turned recently to machine learning to perform directed evolution in a computer. Developing machine learning methods, however, requires large amounts of high-quality data since new approaches must be properly validated. Obtaining high-quality data that relates the sequence of an enzyme to its function is currently a costly and non-trivial task. We propose here to build high-quality, multimodal datasets on enzymes, combining experimental data with domain knowledge, theory, and other descriptions of enzymatic processes. This dataset will be publicly available for use as a benchmarking tool, and the methods for augmenting experimental data with theory will be published as well. To achieve this, we will use state-of-the-art techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, machine learning assisted quantum mechanical calculations, and representation learning. Finally, we propose to develop new machine learning approaches for directed evolution that can incorporate diverse data sources and uncertainty into a continuous learning framework. The proposed tools and datasets have the possibility to deepen our understanding of how enzymes do their truly amazing chemical feats. This can help future development of fuels, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural products made using environmentally-friendly processes, from abundant natural resources. Ultimately, our goal is to lead the chemical industry into a greener future by accelerating the process by which enzyme are integrated into the economy of the 21st century."
Understanding and Predicting Pedestal Scenarios in NSTX-U,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022115,"Hatch, David",David.Hatch@theuniversityoftexasataustin,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Understanding and Predicting Pedestal Scenarios on NSTX-U Principal Investigator: David R. Hatch, Research Scientist, IFS, University of Texas at Austin, Texas. We propose extensive investigations of pedestal transport on NSTX-U using the gyrokinetic GENE code. Our studies will focus on three key parameter dependences that are critical to the NSTX-U mission of establishing an ST physics basis and integrating it with standard aspect ratio: (1) Aspect Ratio: what is the direct effect of the ST geometry on various pedestal instabilities. A theoretical / computational approach to this question is particularly valuable, since it facilitates very controlled investigations, for example, fixing all parameters (gradients, collisionality, etc) except the magnetic geometry, which can be swapped between ST and standard aspect ratio. (2) Collisionality: the favorable collisionality scaling of NSTX makes the low collisionality regimes accessible on NSTX-U particularly compelling. As the pedestal is well-known to disproportionately affect plasma confinement, we will investigate this key parameter dependence on pedestal instabilities. In particular, we have identified microtearing modes (MTMs) as a major pedestal fluctuation in standard aspect ratio pedestals. We will bring this experience to bear on NSTX-U pedestal studies, with a major focus being the collisionality dependence of MTM. MTM is sensitively dependent on collisionality, and is thus an excellent candidate to explain ST collisionality scaling. (3) Wall conditioning: wall conditioning on NSTX has a striking effect on the pedestal, making it much broader and greatly enhancing global confinement. We will compare lithiated and non-lithiated discharges. One key component that we will explore is whether the main effect of lithiated discharges is a reduction in particle source, which prevents pedestal profiles from evolving to MHD limits. To investigate this, we will focus largely on particle sources and particle transport. This picture requires, in particular, very low particle transport levels, which is consistent with some transport mechanisms but not others. The work will focus on three main prospective transport mechanisms in the pedestal (although we are open to finding others in the course of these studies): (1) MTMs, (2) ETG, and (3) KBM. We have experience studying all of these instabilities for standard aspect ratio tokamaks, which will facilitate the development of a unified picture for standard and low aspect ratio pedestals. These instabilities will be considered in the context of the unique pedestal widths and pedestal width scalings observed on STs. The simulations carried out in this research will be uploaded the MGK database, a database of gyrokinetic simulations whose purpose is to serve as a repository for broad ranging GK simulations. This will facilitate systematic comparisons with standard aspect ratio simulation data already populated in the database. MGKDB has been useful in the development of reduced models for pedestal transport in standard aspect ratio devices. We will employ it to this end for STs in this project."

Chandler, Pennsylvania State University Supported Au nanoparticle (NP) catalysts, which are composed of small (< 5 nm) Au NPs on a (typically) metal oxide carrier, have desirable selectivity for several industrially important reactions; however, they suffer from extremely low activity associated with weak H2 adsorption onto the catalyst. Several recent discoveries indicate H2 adsorbs on Au catalysts at the metal-support interface (MSI), reversibly transferring the protons and electrons to the support. The thermodynamics and kinetics of this process are not well understood and offer new opportunities for catalyst design if they can be properly characterized and controlled. This project will improve our fundamental understanding of these processes by (i) characterizing the roles of surface basicity, Au electronics, and support reducibility in influencing this chemistry; (ii) develop and test near-surface support compositions that will allow us to control and tune both the H2 adsorption capacity and adsorption strength of the support; and (iii) add secondary surface reaction centers that can utilize the transferred H-atom equivalents to improve several industrially important catalytic reactions and develop new approaches to several catalytic chemistries. Collectively, these studies will develop catalysts capable of activating H2 at the MSI, transport it across the support as protons and electrons, and transfer the reducing equivalents to hydrogenation targets."

Through molecular engineering of SF molecules, there is a focus on harvesting the exciton pairs to manipulate and control the triplet population/magnetization dynamics to mediate efficient multiexciton transfer processes, convert multiexcitons into to chemical potential at reaction centers by engineering chemically active bridges in SF dimers. This approach leverages the unique properties of SF in individual multiexcitonic molecules and macromolecules that uniquely permit access to solution phase photochemical transformations, i.e., using homogeneous rather than heterogeneous approaches to energy transfer and chemistry.

Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana fermions predicted in the Standard Model have found their counterparts in solid-state topological materials. These emerging quantum materials have been leading to deeper knowledge of important topics in physics, and display a kaleidoscope of novel electronic properties with great promise for technology applications. Thus far, the research in this young field has mainly focused on a non-interacting single particle scenario. On the other hand, the electron-electron correlations are ubiquitous in many processes and known to drive fascinating phenomena. Therefore, extending the topological physics to the regime of interacting electronic system is expected to produce new quantum states and exotic phenomena. With this vision, the overarching goal of this project is to study how electronic correlations entangle with topology to give rise to new states and properties. The approach will be based on Group-V network material platforms to establish interacting topological electronic states, study the technological useful colossal magnetoresistance and its connection with topology and electronic correlations, and design novel material systems that can be further functionalized. This research will advance our understanding of the interacting topological quantum materials, seed new areas for deeper inquiry, and generate critical momentum for the deployment of quantum materials in information storage, sensing, and quantum computing applications.

In Pursuit of Unambiguous Determination of Fe(III) versus Fe(IV) in Transition Metal Oxide Electrocatalysts,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021308,"Chen, Jingyi",Jingyi.Chen@universityofarkansas,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","In Pursuit of Unambiguous Determination of Fe(III) versus Fe(IV) in Transition Metal Oxide Electrocatalysts Lauren F. Greenlee, Ralph E. Martin Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University of Arkansas (Principal Investigator) Clemens Heske, Dept. of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Nevada, Las Vegas (Co-Investigator) Mixed transition metal oxides and hydroxides are at the forefront of materials research for alkaline electrocatalysis due to high catalytic activity and low anticipated cost in energy conversion technologies. Recent density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on FexNi100-xO(H)y electrocatalysts implicate Fe(IV) with a high-spin 3d4 configuration as part of a synergistic dual catalyst site (Fe(IV)-Ni(IV)). Experimental evidence for Fe(IV) remains ambiguous, with hard x-ray absorption spectroscopy (Fe K-edge) and Mössbauer spectroscopy providing evidence for and against Fe(IV) formation. Efforts to probe metal 3d-oxygen 2p hybridization provide conflicting evidence on the relationship between d-electrons, valency, and M-O covalency for relevant transition metal oxides (e.g., Fe2O3, NiO, LaFeO3, LaNiO3). Further, the extent of metal 3d-oxygen 2p orbital covalency in FexNi100-xO(H)y electrocatalysts likely shifts during OER. A coupled proton-electron transfer mechanism might exist, but non-concerted proton-electron transfer mechanisms have also been proposed. In short: The d-state electronic structure of Fe (and Ni) in these oxides/hydroxides, including formalized oxidation state and metal 3d-O 2p covalency, must be unambiguously determined experimentally to fully delineate OER mechanism(s) and propel catalyst materials development. Our research combines coordinated soft x-ray spectroscopic, electrochemical, and theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of FexNi100-xO(H)y and other AxB100-xO(H)y transition metal oxides to delineate and advance consistency between electronic structure and proposed theories of metal-oxygen covalency, metal oxidation state, and proton-electron transfer reaction mechanisms. Hypothesis: When an FexNi100-xO(H)y electrocatalyst is under applied potential in the Faradaic region of the oxygen evolution reaction, a population of Fe atoms will transition from a Fe(III) 3d5 to a Fe(IV) 3d4 electron configuration. The Fe atoms will have a low level of 3d orbital mixing with O 2p, as evidenced by DFT-validated spectral features and experimentally seen in cutting-edge soft x-ray spectroscopy approaches. Objective 1: Use and further develop cutting-edge soft x-ray spectroscopy to describe the electronic and chemical structure at the Fe and O atoms, including accepted formal oxidation state and extent of orbital mixing or covalency, with Fe(II), Fe(III), and Fe(IV) reference compounds. Known reference materials for Fe, Ni, and O that represent a range of valence, coordination environment, phase, and metal d-oxygen p orbital hybridization will be used to correlate experimentally-obtained spectra with theoretical projected density of states. In situ cell design and hardware will be pursued. Objective 2: Determine Fe, O, and Ni electronic and chemical structure for as-synthesized and post-electrochemistry FexNi100-xO(H)y electrocatalyst materials. FexNi100-xO(H)y experimental electrocatalyst materials will be explored with soft x-ray spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis will be used to link electronic band structure results from experiment and theory. Objective 3: Develop a computational framework to describe the FexNi100-xO(H)y electrocatalyst electronic structure. Computational and theoretical modeling will create computed spectra, describe kinetic and thermodynamic scaling relationships, propose relevant reaction mechanism(s), and iteratively enable determination of electrocatalyst band structure. Future work will extend to relevant and related AxB100-xO(H)y transition metal oxides. This research will contribute new knowledge about the chemical and electronic structure of FexNi100-xO(H)y (and similarly structured) electrocatalysts, with a particular focus on the active catalyst and probing the existence of a Fe(IV) oxidation state. This project will provide a scientific basis for the alkaline electrocatalysis research community to improve and direct catalyst development and design, including shedding light on active site identification, reaction mechanism, and correlations between as-synthesized catalyst properties and operando electronic band structure, with impacts to electrocatalysis, battery materials, chemical conversion, fossil fuel upgrading, polymer conversion/recycling, and water treatment."
Improving the Parameterization of Cloud and Rain Microphysics in E3SM using a Novel Observationally-Constrained Bayesian Approach,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021270,"van Lier-Walqui, Marcus",Marcus.van Lier-Walqui@thetrusteesofcolumbiauniversityinthecityofnewyork(morningsidecampus),"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Motivation: Earth System Models (ESMs), including the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), suffer from biases in cloud properties. To some extent these biases can be mitigated by tuning free parameters associated with microphysics or other cloud-related parameterizations. However, a critical challenge is the fact that not all sources of parameterization error are easily adjusted or tuned. That is, most parameterization schemes suffer from so-called ``structural errors'' that are the result of fixed approximations, assumptions, and uncertain mathematical formulations. If structural errors could be addressed, then tuning can be performed such that optimal parameter values represent true physical knowledge. In this case, so-called ``bottom-up'' approaches to ESM model development, wherein parameterizations are revised to incorporate advances in process-level knowledge, can be reconciled with ``top-down'' approaches, wherein tuning is performed on the full ESM by relying on ``emergent properties'' of the climate system to constrain parameterizations. For parameterizing cloud microphysics, uncertainties exist at all levels of scheme complexity and scales. It is challenging to quantify these uncertainties rigorously in current microphysics schemes because many of their structural elements are fixed and “hard-coded” into scheme formulations. To address this challenge, we have recently developed a new bulk parameterization of microphysics, the Bayesian Observationally-constrained Statistical-physical Scheme (BOSS). This approach allows for systematic adjustment of scheme structure and quantification of structural and parametric uncertainties via Bayesian inference. It provides a consistent framework for uncertainty quantification and constraint using both bottom-up (e.g., from detailed process-level microphysical modeling) and top-down (e.g., from global satellite observations) approaches. In this way, BOSS facilitates a hierarchical approach to parameterization development and tuning. Proposed research: We will use BOSS to parameterize liquid (cloud and rain) microphysics in E3SM. Bottom-up and top-down experiments will be performed, using information from the former as prior probabilities for the latter — thus ensuring that the two are consistent. Our bottom-up approach will utilize column- and box-models with constraint of BOSS provided by a number of “reference” bin and bulk microphysics schemes, while our top-down tests will use BOSS integrated into the Morrison and Gettelman (MG2) microphysics parameterization in E3SM. For the top-down tests, we will employ a number of global satellite datasets as the constraint, representing a best estimate of climate- and cloud-relevant quantities. For all top-down experiments, microphysical parameters as well as those in other model parameterizations will be simultaneously perturbed. We will also compare a top-down ``control'' constraint of E3SM parameters with one where BOSS replaces the standard liquid microphysics parameterization, thus revealing any unique benefits of using BOSS. Expected outcomes: The main objective is an improved treatment of microphysics in E3SM, rigorously informed by state-of-the-art microphysical process models and optimally tuned against a set of extensive global satellite-derived observations. This will improve the representation of microphysics in warm clouds, which impacts climate sensitivity and is critical for modeling aerosol indirect effects and the hydrological cycle. While we expect this effort to yield tangible improvement in E3SM climate simulations and reduced uncertainty, this will also demonstrate the hierarchical, combined bottom-up and top-down Bayesian approach as a viable method for parameterization development, testing, and tuning in ESMs more broadly."

ZIFs are nanoporous molecular sieves with potential for application to a range of membrane- and adsorption-based gas separations. The research approach will employ vapor-phase synthesis, testing, simulation, and characterization approaches in order to test hypotheses regarding the flexibility of nanoconfined ZIFs. This class of nanocomposite ZIF thin films is unique and exhibits interesting separations performance in part because of a unique synthesis approach: an all-vapor-phase ligand induced permselectivation (LIPS) method (Science 361, 1008-1011 (2018)), and a modification of LIPS through a vapor phase linker/ligand treatment (VPLT) method that leads to large selectivity improvements for certain gas mixtures (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 58, 16390 –16394 (2019)). In particular, the propylene/propane separation performance of LIPS/VPLT ZIF membranes confined (entirely or partially) inside mesopores is remarkably superior to that of most conventional ZIF membranes consisting of unconfined (deposited on the external surface of porous supports) polycrystalline films. However, a fundamental understanding of the factors that lead to such performance is not available. It is hypothesized that the mesoporous support, which serves as the matrix of the selective ZIF component of the membrane, through interfacial interactions plays a vital role in affecting the ZIF structure. The combination of LIPS with VPLT is an essential part of a methodology for testing this hypothesis. This research consists of four interwoven methodological challenges: (i) extension of the LIPS/VPLT methods to create a range of membrane nanostructures; (ii) adsorption isotherm and diffusivity determination using a combination of experiments and mathematical analysis; (iii) structure determination; and (iv) molecular-level understanding using simulations. Task 1 will be performed at JHU (Tsapatsis) to address (i) and (ii) above, while Task 2 will encompass characterization methods (iii) and be accomplished at Brookhaven National Lab and SBU (Boscoboinik). Task 3 focusses on simulations (iv), and it will be performed at UMN (Siepmann). Overall, this research elucidates structural characteristics that are responsible for the high performance of confined ZIF nanocomposites in order to extend the use of LIPS and VPLT to other confined metal organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites."

These experiments use nuclei to probe both nuclear physics and fundamental symmetries, with the goal of understanding weak interactions in beta decay, r-process, and double-beta decay. The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is designed to study the structure of neutron-rich nuclei and shed light on the dynamics leading to the formation of the elements in the universe. At Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) interactions between nucleons are probed via electron scattering from nuclei. Neutrinoless double beta decay facilities use nuclei to assess whether neutrinos are Majorana particles and probe the neutrino mass hierarchy. In the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), nuclei are the active material used to detect neutrinos and accurately measure neutrino oscillation parameters. The success of these experimental programs relies on an accurate understanding of nuclear structure and dynamics, required to meaningfully interpret the body of experimental data and disentangle new physics signals from underlying nuclear effects. The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive program of analyzing electroweak interactions with nuclei by studying lepton-nucleus interactions in a wide range of energy and momentum transfer, and precisely compare the theory with available electroweak nuclear data. In particular, the calculations use effective field theory and phenomenological approaches to develop many-body nuclear interactions and currents, and Quantum Monte Carlo computational methods to solve the strongly-correlated nuclear many-body problem.

We will test this hypothesis with an anisotropic mesoscale grain growth model that incorporates the complexity of grain boundary character and energy anisotropy. Rather than rely on heuristics to define the grain growth behavior, we will teach the mesoscale grain growth model how to simulate grain growth. This is accomplished by integrating experimental microstructure data with model-based machine learning strategies. A machine learning approach is necessary for us to capture the high combinatorial, highly complex space of grain boundary character in a grain growth model. The developed anisotropic mesoscale grain growth model will be a new tool for exploring the microstructural features and processing parameters critical to inducing and sustaining or inhibiting abnormal grain growth. This project addresses two of DOE&rsquo;s main topic areas: (1) synthesis science including nucleation, growth and restructuring of hierarchical materials and (2) behavior of properties and processes in extreme environments, particularly temperature and magnetic fields. This goal will be accomplished by our team&rsquo;s unique expertise, which encompasses grain boundary characterization, machine learning methods, mesoscale grain growth modeling, and thermomagnetic materials processing. This project will be divided into three tasks using alumina as a model material due to its high anisotropy: 1. Use machine learning methods to identify the physical descriptors of 3D microstructural data collected at different periods of grain growth. The samples will be made with both traditional powder processing and a thermo-magnetic process to create a wide array of grain topologies and crystallographic textures. 2. Apply transfer and reinforcement learning to train the anisotropic mesoscale grain growth model, where the machine learning agents will adjust the simulations to reach the physical descriptors previously identified for each growth period in Task 1. 3. Validate the developed model by conducting a grain growth study using a non-destructive characterization method and directly comparing the results to simulations. We will then test our hypothesis using the validated anisotropic mesoscale grain growth model with simulated microstructures where we control the character anisotropy of neighboring grain boundaries. The anisotropic mesoscale grain growth model will provide mechanistic insight into grain growth that would otherwise be inaccessible from experiments and isotropic grain growth models. These insights could inspire new processing designs that either promote or avoid these grain boundary character networks to control abnormal grain growth."

Rhee, Carnegie Institution for Science (Principal Investigator) David W. Ehrhardt, Carnegie Institution for Science (Co-Investigator) Markita del Carpio Landry, UC Berkeley (Co-Investigator) Jenny Mortimer, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (Co-Investigator) Climate change is rapidly changing the habitability of many species on Earth. Plants have a big role in slowing down climate change as major carbon sequesters, solar energy harvesters, and food providers for many species including humans. Plant metabolism underpins many traits that improve plant productivity but there are many holes in our understanding of how it works as a system. To quantify, model, predict, and engineer desirable metabolic traits such as to maximize biomass production under suboptimal conditions or reallocation of biomass from carbohydrates to lipids, we must decode the complex metabolic networks. Subcellular compartmentation of metabolic reactions through the locations of enzymes is critical to understanding, modeling, and engineering plant metabolism. Yet, the localization of the majority of the predicted enzymes are not yet known. The paucity of experimentally validated information in most plants, especially in all the DOE flagship plants, severely limits scientists and engineers to assess the performance and translatability of computational tools and resources. In this proposed work, a trans-disciplinary team with expertise in plant cell biology, genomics, metabolic modeling, algorithm development, synthetic biology, geochemistry, nanotechnology, and analytical chemistry will develop an integrated pipeline that combines computational prediction, metabolic network modeling, and high-throughput experimental testing using state of the art technologies in live confocal imaging, nanomaterial-mediated plant transformation, and metabolic network modeling. Using the pipeline, the team will create a high-quality subcellular map of small molecule metabolism in Sorghum andBrachypodium. Using this network, the team will create accurately compartmentalized metabolic network models. The models will be experimentally validated by measuring a series of outputs in response to environmental challenges, and by knocking out gene expression in somatic tissue using carbon nanotube-mediated CRISPR technology. This project has several novel components that could have a wide impact to a range of fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Metabolic Engineering, Cell Biology, Computational Biology, Plant Science and Biochemistry. It will create a set of ground-truth data for subcellular locations of metabolic enzymes, develop a novel integrative pipeline for accelerating knowledge generation, further develop a novel plant transformation technology with potentially broad application, and yield important insight into the structure and function of metabolic networks in both a biofuel model plant and a biofuel crop. This will be the first time such a large-scale, high-resolution imaging-based localization information of metabolic enzymes is generated for any plant. This dataset will have long-lasting value for benchmarking machine learning algorithms for localization prediction and image annotation. Moreover, the cellular view of metabolism at this scale has not been approached before. This project has the potential to create a new window into our understanding of metabolism in the cellular context. Finally, the novel approach of using carbon nanotubes to transform somatic cells in the leaf meristem to generate clonal sectors and perform metabolic network modeling and validation can rapidly test the validity of the models and enable rapid cycles of metabolic engineering for important traits."

The hypothesis driving this research is that there will be an optimum interlayer spacing of layered materials to enable electrochemical reactivity in the interlayer. Layered and 2D materials have broad applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis, where it is hypothesized that the catalytically active sites reside at edges and surface defects. This proposed research will investigate how the nanoconfined interlayer of these materials can be made accessible for electrocatalytic activity. Nanoconfinement has been shown to affect the physical properties of molecules and solvents and may be utilized to further tune electrochemical activity. Importantly, the research will utilize a materials chemistry approach to define the nanoconfinement environment via molecular pillars &ndash; molecules of defined length anchored within the interlayer. In order to test this hypothesis, the proposed research will investigate how molecular pillaring of a prototypical layered material, MoS2, influences the electrocatalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction, a critical step in the electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen fuel. The scientific merits of this proposed research include: (1) the control of matter at the atomic scale to define nanoconfinement geometry, (2) the characterization of the dynamics of nanoconfined solvents within the hybridized layered materials, and (3) the mechanistic understanding of a liquid-phase electrochemical reaction under nanoconfinement by the hybridized layered materials.

Scale-Aware Modeling of Instabilities and Mixing in HED Flows,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020229,"Aluie, Hussein",Hussein.Aluie@universityofrochester,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Instabilities and mixing are detrimental to system performance in high-energy density (HED) applications such as fusion power systems. Numerical models used in HED applications have had significant difficulties predicting the instabilities and mixing that occur in experiments. Most of these &ldquo;global-system&rdquo; models cannot resolve a sufficient level of vorticity that develops hydrodynamically. Recent evidence from several independent investigations indicates that this shortcoming contributes to under-predicting the levels of instability growth and mixing in such highly nonlinear flows. Routinely conducting multi-physics global-system three-dimensional simulations at the high resolution required to resolve the missing vorticity is not feasible in the foreseeable future due to the exorbitant computing cost. To address this problem, a &ldquo;coarse-graining&rdquo; scale-analysis approach that is versatile and powerful will be used to develop a nonlinear mixing model (NMM) capable of accounting for the missing vorticity in a self-consistent manner. Coarse-graining has a rigorous mathematical foundation and is closely related to well-established physics techniques, including macroscopic electromagnetism, renormalization group, and Large Eddy Simulations. NMM is a deterministic model of vorticity and strain that is &ldquo;scale-aware&rdquo; in the sense that it self-adjusts to the underlying numerical resolution without relying on user input. NMM is also portable in the sense that it is not dependent on a particular numerical scheme and can be eventually deployed in HED application codes. With that eventual goal in sight, the research plan includes an extensive development, testing, and validation program. The project should enable HED application codes, such as those used in fusion, to better predict instability growth and mixing at a significantly lower computational cost. The project may also prove valuable beyond HED applications by advancing a new systematic approach to devising deterministic scale-aware models that reflect the latent unresolved physics."

The process of chemical doping is often accompanied by spatial inhomogeneity, characterized by nanometer-scale variations in electronic and/or magnetic properties of the material. Although various microscopy techniques have provided valuable nanoscale insight into electronic and chemical structures of many complex oxides, there is still no atomic-scale magnetic information available on these systems. Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) can in principle be used to image magnetic ordering, but SP-STM has historically been applied primarily to relatively simple magnetic materials and nanostructures. This research project aims to expand SP-STM imaging to complex oxides, focusing on uncovering the magnetic structure of doped Iridium-based oxides (iridates) with sub-atomic precision. The main objectives include: (1) visualizing the evolution of magnetism in iridates, as a function of charge carrier doping, temperature and energy, (2) elucidating the relationship between the inhomogeneous electronic structure and magnetism at the nanoscale, and (3) searching for signatures of new magnetic phases. The comprehensive experimental approach developed in this project will provide a foundation to study other families of complex oxides in which spin, charge and orbital degrees of freedom intertwine to create new states of matter."

One overlooked area where lost power output can be recaptured and attendant problems (e.g., flow-induced vibration (FIV)) addressed is the main steam piping system. The technology underlying piping system components is essentially >100 years old, and incentives to improve pipe components have been limited by costs (development, retrofitting and unforeseen risks and problems) and analysis tools that are incapable of assessing candidate designs. More recently, market and technology conditions have changed that provide additional incentives to address these problems. Firstly, power uprates have resulted in higher steam flow speeds that increase head losses and, in some cases, exacerbate fatigue inducing FIV. Secondly, the cost competitiveness of alternative energy sources, and smaller profit margins, have increased the willingness of the industry to squeeze out moderate power generation increases (e.g., 1% via measurement uncertainty recovery) and address FIV and other flow-related problems that increase maintenance costs. Thirdly, the potential of sophisticated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software has significantly advanced design assessment capabilities. Unfortunately, contemporary CFD methods are difficult and expensive to use, and current approaches to redesign piping components use a combination of experimental testing and limited flow modeling, together with human intuition regarding the geometrical modifications anticipated to improve flow and reduce unsteadiness. What is lacking however is a formal design approach that automates both the analysis process and the design search – exactly what the proposed effort seeks to address. Recently, Continuum Dynamics, Inc. developed a novel prototype CFD solver, denoted CGE, which is both easy to use and generates predictions with industry leading accuracy. The proposed effort builds upon this prototype state-of-the art Cartesian grid-based CFD solver, that eliminates user involvement in the mesh generation process, analysis, and design optimization, to develop a design and analysis system tailored specifically to the needs of the nuclear power industry in assessing and correcting piping system losses and FIV. The Phase I effort saw the initial development of an efficient, easy-to-use CFD software tool for analyzing complicated piping systems and developing of new improved designs. In Phase I, a prototype analysis was developed, and an adjoint-based geometry optimization procedure was formulated and tested. New piping component designs identified in Phase I were non-obvious, and demonstrated significant reductions in head loss and swirl. Phase I established proof-of-concept, and lays the foundation for Phase II that would see the full implementation of the adjoint-based optimization method in the CGE CFD solver, implementation of additional turbulence modelling options, high performance computing scalability enhancements, and integration into a design framework, along with extensive software debugging, validation and testing on real-world problems. A successful effort would produce a robust, validated, and easy-to-operate computational tool for the analysis and geometrical design of fluid transport components that minimize head loss and dynamic structural loads that are important issues for the nuclear power industry. Indeed, addressing such problems, that currently reduce generation capacity and increase maintenance costs through unscheduled outages related to component failure, is critical to ensuring the viability of nuclear power by maintaining cost competitiveness with other sources of electricity. Given the need for such a capability, together with prior experience in addressing internal flow problems in the nuclear industry, CDI believes that with modest market entry, the combined sales, and associated service work, could generate cumulative revenues in excess of $34M in the first ten years of commercialization after Phase II. Cost savings for customers, which would be passed on to the rate paying public, would be at least an order of magnitude larger, and would be attributed to lower maintenance costs, improved power generation, and longer component service life."
New Experimental Views on the Role of Temperature in Extreme Strain Rate Mechanics,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0018091,"Schuh, Christopher",Christopher.Schuh@massachusettsinstituteoftechnology,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","This project studies the extreme phenomena that occur when small particles (of order 10 micrometers) strike materials at supersonic velocities. These conditions are relevant to understanding a range of practical technological circumstances, such as dust/sand strikes on moving aircraft, micrometeor impact on satellites, and a variety of manufacturing operations from sand blasting to ‘cold spray’ additive manufacturing. Upon impact, such small, fast particles can trigger many unique behaviors, including the initiation of shock waves, the backward ejection of ‘jets’ of substrate material, and—importantly—the generation of significant heat locally. Such heating affects all of the other deformation and damage phenomena at the impact site, and in some cases has been found to be high enough to melt metals like tin or bismuth. Unfortunately, such temperature rises have never been directly measured before, because the timescales over which heat develops (~10 nanoseconds) and the length scale for heat conduction (~micrometers) are so fine that typical methods of temperature measurement cannot detect the signal. The prior work of the PIs under DOE support has endeavored to develop new experimental techniques in which these high-strain-rate microparticle impacts are directly observed, with nano/micro spatial scales and on nanosecond times scales. Our experimental results, combined with mathematical and physical modeling, have yielded significant advances in understanding these extreme impacts, but in each case our lack of experimental information about the evolution of temperature in the impacted region has limited the certainty with which we can interpret our measurements. The current project is focused on addressing the challenging unknown variable of temperature directly. We are developing a portfolio of new techniques to control and measure the temperature during microparticle impact experiments. First, measurements in which we control the test temperature are used with low-melting point metals, to identify the test temperature at which impact melting can first be observed. Second, indirect temperature measurements can be made using trace amounts of low-melting point metals as local temperature probes; by watching for the melting of those small markers, we can map locations around the impact site where surface temperatures reached that melting point. Finally, a new approach to directly measuring temperature during the very short time of the impact is also possible using the thermoreflectance of a laser spot near the impact site. Results from these methods are compiled and cross-compared, and used to help calibrate materials models that can be used to simulate wide ranges of conditions and materials. The results are also used to directly test several contested hypotheses about material behavior under extreme conditions."

In a nutshell, by using several novel techniques, including entirely new ways of choosing optimal basis sets for strongly correlated systems, we can make correlated wavefunction calculations with DMRG far more efficient than before. We then use recently developed machine learning techniques to create density functionals which correct the errors in standard semilocal approximations, to yield “chemical' accuracy” (errors less than 1.6 milliHartree) for strongly correlated systems. Progress so far has been driven by the meticulous creation of a 1D mimic of real electronic structure calculations, in which approximate density functionals make errors that are quantitatively similar to those in realistic simulations. We have developed algorithms and tuned the interaction so that DMRG calculations are extremely efficient in this 1D world, and even include a mimic of the electron-electron cusp. This has allowed us to run a near endless sequence of calculations to create/refine/test our new basis set approaches, and to generate sufficient data to create machine-learned density functionals on strongly correlated systems, and in the thermodynamic limit. We have already demonstrated how efficient our basis functions are in (quasi-one-dimensional) realistic calculations. In this funding period, we further develop a new approach, multi-sliced gausslet DMRG, which is now able to calculate hydrogen chain systems in the complete-basis-limit with exact correlation, something no other approach can achieve. We will also extend this method to treat arbitrary small to medium sized molecules. Simultaneously, we are creating the machinery to train machine-learned density functionals on the output from these multi-sliced calculations, thus reproducing this high accuracy in routine low-cost DFT calculations. The DMRG approach is crucial for rapidly generating data for training functionals, and for treating the most correlated systems. For a broad range of other systems, the machine-learned density functional will provide high accuracy ground-state energies and densities with much lower computational cost. The codes and methods will all be placed in the public domain, using the ITensor library, which is being developed into a user-friendly resource for others to apply DMRG algorithms to strongly correlated systems."

Sometimes, these interactions are not too complicated, and one can obtain qualitatively correct results with a simple mean-?eld treatment in which electrons are allowed to interact with each other only in an average sort of way. Under these circumstances, a more detailed description of the correlations between electrons is fairly straightforward, but is only needed if one seeks quantitative accuracy. Many important physical phenomena, however, involve strong correlations. In this case, one cannot obtain even a qualitatively correct description of the physics without including the most important electronic correlation e?ects. Moreover, the weak residual correlations must still be included for quantitative accuracy, and this is far more complicated for strongly-correlated problems than it is for weakly-correlated ones. Frequently, the simple mean-?eld theory signals its own failure by unphysically breaking some or all of the symmetries of the system. While this symmetry breaking is artifactual, it generally leads to an improved energetic description, although it can compromise the description of properties other than energies. To correct the de?ciencies of symmetry-broken theories, we prefer to use symmetry-projected techniques which use only the physically relevant portion of a symmetry-broken wave function. Even symmetry-projected mean-?eld theory is often enough to get a roughly correct understanding of many interesting problems. Going beyond mean-?eld with symmetry-projected correlated approaches is often quantatively accurate even for strongly-correlated systems. We refer to symmetry-projected correlated theories as “correlate then project” as they ?rst correlate the symmetry-broken state, then projectively restore the broken symmetries. Unfortunately, these “correlate then project” theories are complicated, and do not readily cap-ture strong correlations not derived from mean-?eld symmetry breaking. In this proposal we seek to remedy this weakness. We envision a “project then correlate” idea, in which those correlations not related to mean-?eld symmetry breaking are described by correlating the symmetry-projected mean-?eld state; future work will marry the two threads of “project then correlate” and “correlate then project.” The techniques developed in this proposal will provide accurate computational methods for problems such as magnetic phenomena, chemical reactions, and molecular applications, all of which are of interest to the DOE."

The magnitude of this cooling strongly depends on the cloud coverage, which in turn depends on the spatial organization of clouds into closed cell high clouds and open cell low clouds. Beyond their instantaneous radiative effects, an emerging body of work on climate feedbacks shows that closed cell stratocumulus clouds are much more sensitive to future warming than open cells and shallow cumulus. This implies that it is critical to accurately represent the physical processes that determine cloud morphology such that we can confidently assess cloud feedbacks on future climate change. The transition from closed to open cellular modes is primarily dictated by gradients in environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature (SST), which controls surface flux magnitude, and lower tropospheric stability, which impacts the ability of clouds to grow upward and interact with the overlying free troposphere. The traditional view is that buoyancy generated at the surface by a warming SST induces more vigorous updrafts, which slowly erode the stable layer capping the clouds. But the onset of precipitation, which is modulated by background aerosol loading, introduces a new physical pathway for the shift to surface-driven convection. Evaporating rain below cloud base causes local cooling which further accelerates rain-laden downdrafts. As these downdrafts near the surface, they diverge and cause gust fronts known as cold pools. Collisions of cold pools mechanically induce new updrafts that then generate new precipitation, which removes more aerosol, generating stronger precipitation and more intense cold pools, finally catalyzing the transition away from closed cell cloud organization. Recent studies have shown that a model must include some representation of aerosol removal by precipitation to simulate this physical pathway as well as a mechanism to generate cold pools. While fine-scale models can represent these complicated aerosol-precipitation-dynamics feedbacks, global circulation models cannot. Thus, despite the modeling evidence presented to date, it is unclear whether aerosol impacts on convective organization are globally important or tractable from a global modeling perspective. This project therefore proposes a set of experiments to: (1) identify the importance of aerosol-cold pool feedbacks on long-term observations of transition cases at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) site; and (2) determine the minimum complexity required to represent the relevant physical mechanisms in coarse-gridded atmospheric models using idealized simulations and realistic case studies at ENA. These experiments will lead to improved understanding of feedbacks among aerosols, clouds and convective processes as well as improved simulation of the radiative effects of organized shallow convection. The first objective will be accomplished by analyzing observations to understand the synoptic and aerosol conditions associated with low cloud transitions and observable cold pools at ENA, while the second objective will involve a set of idealized and observationally-forced large eddy simulations using a ""process denial"" approach."

With an increase advancement in systems biology approaches, computational modeling, sequence-based homologue searching, and molecular docking will allow us to elucidate PA6 biological basis of degradation using several target enzymes classes. We will also investigate a direct relationship between the PA6 material morphology and topology and efficiency of enzymatic degradation using several modeling approaches as well as experimental testing. The intercept between polymer morphology and enzyme kinetics will allow us to propose model pathway for degradation of PA6 previously unattainable by existing biological systems. STORM contains both polymer degradation and polymer morphology modeling approaches. For degradation, the research concept involves integration of computational modeling, elucidating of the biological catalyst for degradation via homologue searches and evolutionary analyses, experimental laboratory testing of enzyme efficacy, and finally, optimization of enzyme expression in model organisms. Enzymes of interest will be fed into enzyme-substrate models to down-select potentially effective enzymes. Homology searches and alignments will then be used to identify target enzymes in currently available organisms. Laboratory testing will be performed on the down-selected enzymes to determine degradation efficacy and parameters. These enzymes will then be engineered into a model organism for overexpression capable of degrading PA6 at higher rates. This work will provide the first known technology for degradation and upcycling of recalcitrant PA6 polymers. Key risks include low yields of enzymes, cost of genetic engineering of organisms, and effective connection of the degradation portion of work. These identified risks will be mitigated through proper enzyme down-selection prior to testing, experimental testing prior to overexpression, and the use of teaming partners at Debut Biotechnology and the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) User Facilities, who will provide technical expertise in these areas. The project will generate degradation pathway for PA6, for which there is currently no effective technology beyond incineration or disposal in landfills. STORM project will identify and characterize enzymes capable of degrading PA6, advancing the science of polymer upcycling. As the technology will be enzymatically and biologically produced, the associated cost and environmental footprint will be minimal."

The objective of this research project is to target catalytic incorporation of abundant small molecule feedstocks (especially N2O, H2, CO) into readily available organic matter (e.g. alkenes, alkynes, alcohols) to create value-added products in an economic manner. The central hypothesis is that use of heterobimetallic catalysis and/or single-electron redox chemistry will enable reactivity and selectivity patterns that complement those of classical, mononuclear metal catalysts. The rationale for pursuing this approach is that in developing the targeted catalytic transformations, the project will provide valuable fundamental knowledge about unconventional catalytic strategies that can be exploited by the catalysis science community more broadly. To test the central hypothesis and achieve the objective, these aims will be pursued: (1) design & synthesize heterobinuclear catalysts for olefin epoxidation with N2O; (2) use data-intensive multivariate statistical analysis to identify factors controlling product selectivity in heterobimetallic hydrogenation and hydrofunctionalization catalysis; (3) develop catalytic C-C bond-forming reactions of CO using heterobimetallic and radical mechanisms. Collective attainment of the objective will provide a rigorous fundamental study of the impact of binuclear catalysis and/or radical chemistry on catalytic incorporation of small molecule feedstocks into abundant, industrially relevant organic matter. Such fundamental knowledge will help move the field vertically by advancing catalytic strategies that are unconventional and underdeveloped."

These low potential (high energy) proteins behave as central energy-conserving hubs, serving as conduits between diverse redox donors and acceptors. While it is clear that Fds are abundant across the tree of life, with individual microbes frequently using multiple Fd paralogs to control electron flow, we do not yet understand what controls the proportion of electrons relayed by individual Fds among the diverse oxidoreductases found within cells. Our goal is to elucidate the physicochemical parameters that underlie Fd control over electron flow sufficiently so that we can use Fd sequence and structure to anticipate the proportion of electrons that colocalized Fds deliver to their various natural partners. We posit that studies that characterize large numbers of natural and non-natural protein-protein interactions involving structurally-diverse Fds will be critical to establishing the rules that underlie sequence-structure-electron transfer (ET) relationships in Fds. Project Description: Through three objectives this project will provide insight into the physical characteristics of Fds and their partner proteins that dictate energy flow across the electron fluxome in cells. First, we will use cellular assays to analyze how Fds from diverse organisms vary in their electron cycling between pairs of donor/acceptor proteins that require electron transfer across distinct midpoint potential ranges. These measurements will establish how Fd electron transfer depends upon midpoint potential. Second, we will analyze how Fds from diverse organisms vary in their ET between pairs of donor/acceptor protein homologs that require ET across similar midpoint potential ranges. Biochemical studies will be used to examine how electron transfer relates to Fd-partner binding affinities. Third, we will evaluate linear pathway efficiencies in cellular assays by measuring the rate of reductant consumption versus the rate of biomass accumulation and investigate how this parameter depends upon linear pathway protein expression and branch points. Potential Impact of Project: The proposed studies will: (1) increase fundamental understanding of complex reactions that control the proportions of electrons delivered to different biochemical pathways within cells, (2) provide insight into Fd properties that control their specificity in transducing electrons to diverse partner proteins beyond the context of one cell type, (3) combine classical biophysical, computational, and experimental approaches with synthetic biology to address fundamental questions about electron carriers, (4) be relevant to 2Fe-2S Fds that relay electrons in photosynthetic systems and 4Fe-4S Fds that relay electrons in fuel producing organisms (C. acetobutylicum), and (5) provide foundational knowledge that helps engineers anticipate how to build cells that shuttle appropriate proportions of electrons between different energy-related reactions (fuel molecule synthesis, photosynthesis, energy-conserving coupled processes) to maximize carbon flux through desired pathways and eliminate CO2 waste."

Dean, Virginia Tech (Principal Investigator) Lance C. Seefeldt, Utah State University (Co-Investigator) Project Summary. This renewal application describes the continuation of a research program aimed at elucidating molecular level details of the mechanism of reduction of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to hydrocarbons (e.g., C1 to C4) catalyzed by nitrogenase. The reduction of these abundant small molecules represents the most difficult reactions catalyzed in nature. Revealing the underlying catalytic principles that biology uses to achieve such reductions under benign conditions should provide foundational knowledge for the design of sustainable biomimetic catalysts for achieving these difficult reductions at scale. Progress during the last funding period included: (i) characterizing the properties of Fe-hydrides on the nitrogenase active site FeMo-cofactor as central to the mechanism for reduction of both N2 and CO2, including use of advanced quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations; (ii) purification and comparative analyses of all three nitrogenase isozymes; (iii) demonstration that all three enzymes follow the same fundamental re/oa mechanism at the E4 state; and (iv) development of a robust kinetic model that provides quantitative determination of the relative rates of H2 formation and N2 reduction by all three nitrogenases. In the current proposal, we build on these foundations to advance full mechanisms for the reduction of these two recalcitrant molecules. The specific aims proposed are: 1. Gain molecular-level insights into how the cofactors and protein environments in the three nitrogenase isozymes contribute to N2reduction, while disfavoring unproductive H2 formation. We propose a multi-pronged approach using a combination of amino acid substitutions, analysis of the product formation rates by altered proteins, application of a robust kinetic model to deduce rate constants for competing reactions, characterization by advanced spectroscopy methods, and application of QM/MM calculations, to build a framework of the chemical principles that control the N2 reduction reaction. 2. Reveal chemical principles that tune nitrogenase CO2 reduction product distribution between CO/hydrocarbons or formate. The product profiles for CO2 reduction for the three nitrogenase isozymes will be established. Further, the consequences of substituting select amino acid side chains in the vicinity of the active site cofactors on product distribution will be evaluated. Advanced QM/MM calculations are outlined as a way to build reaction pathways with energy levels for the CO2 reduction reactions, adding chemical principles to our understanding of factors controlling product distribution. 3. Apply recently developed rapid purification methods to all three nitrogenase forms (Mo-dependent, V-dependent, and Fe-only) to advance comparative catalytic and biophysical characterization of all three systems to accomplish goals 1 & 2 above.In the previous funding period, we implemented a Strep-tag based affinity purification approach (STAC) that permits the rapid purification of all three nitrogenase isozymes. The application of this purification procedure will permit the rapid implementation and advancement of goals 1 & 2. Potential Impacts. The studies proposed here will provide new insights into the molecular-level mechanism of N2 and CO2 reduction. Such transformations offer an approach to utilize these abundant starting compounds for the storage of renewably generated electrons/protons and in the synthesis of a vast array of important compounds. The reduction of N2 and CO2 by multiple electrons and protons is difficult, with many known catalysts having limited reaction rates or lifetimes or utilizing significant fossil energy. The studies outlined here will provide valuable insights that can be used in the design of new, sustainable catalysts."

Brutchey, University of Southern California (Principal Investigator) A 2019 report by the National Academies on the Frontiers of Materials Research emphasized the “need for a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium phenomena . . . in materials science.” Dimensionally confined materials, such as colloidal nanocrystals that are less than 100 nm in size, are proving to be a fertile test bed for the exploration of materials in nonequilibrium states. Such metastable states – that is, materials trapped with positive free energies above the equilibrium state – will potentially lead to exciting new properties and value-added materials for energy-relevant technologies. Unfortunately, much of our current understanding of synthesis science is based on materials operating at the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium, and among those metastable nanocrystals that have been made, their discovery has generally only occurred by serendipity. A virtually unexplored aspect of materials chemistry remains the possibility of rationally making materials on the nanoscale that do not exist under standard conditions in the analogous bulk materials. Achieving this milestone will lead to a paradigm shift in colloidal nanocrystal chemistry, whereby entirely new types of materials with novel properties can be produced, moving beyond the traditional model of simple size reduction of known, thermodynamically preferred materials. The PI’s prior DOE BES grant (DE-FG02-11ER46826) funded the discovery of particular molecular precursors that can be leveraged to make complex metal chalcogenide nanocrystals in metastable states; however, the mechanism by which these metastable materials form remains unknown and unexplored. Using a materials chemistry approach, we will execute hypothesis-driven basic research with the following three specific and deliverable objectives: (1) Leverage unique synthesis methods to develop a mechanistic understanding of how metastable nanocrystal materials form. Focus will be placed on (i) observing key intermediates in the reaction pathway and (ii) understanding why those intermediates form using a statistical design of experiments approach. This information will elucidate the formation pathway of metastable complex metal chalcogenide nanocrystals. (2)Perform high-level structural characterization of the resulting materials to probe the length scales at which the structure persists. A structural picture of the resulting metastable nanocrystals will be developed using a dual-space approach with synchrotron X-ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. These methods will also be used to test the persistence of these metastable materials as a function of external conditions. The resulting information will be critical for establishing structure-property relationships. (3)Propose a predictive framework for the formation of metastable phases. The mechanistic findings will be used to construct a conceptual framework to predict the formation of metastable materials of complex compositions that do not exist in bulk. This project will result in an improved mechanistic understanding of how metastable nanocrystal materials are formed in direct pathway syntheses, which will better enable the predictive synthesis of energy-relevant materials in nonequilibrium states."
Converting methoxy groups on lignin-derived aromatics from a toxic hurdle to a useful resource: a systems-driven approach,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022318,"Marx, Christopher",Christopher.Marx@regentsoftheuniversityofidaho,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Lignin-derived compounds from plant biomass are amongst the most recalcitrant for microbial conversion. Hydrolysates contain a wide variety of aromatic molecules, which are often toxic. Furthermore, a particular issue with these molecules is that many of them are methoxylated: these methoxy groups are released as formaldehyde during degradation, which creates a second source of toxicity that can challenge standard heterotrophs. In an earlier DOE project, we discovered that some Methylobacterium strains grow exceptionally well on aromatics, and do not release formaldehyde into the medium from the methoxy groups present, unlike classic systems for aromatic degradation (e.g., Pseudomonas putida). One reason methylotrophic bacteria may be well suited for utilizing methoxylated aromatics is their high capacity to produce and consume formaldehyde internally during growth on single-carbon compounds like methanol. Beyond this, however, both Marx and Martinez-Gomez have recently discovered that methylotrophs also have a complex formaldehyde stress response involving multiple sensors and response proteins, as well as the unexpected involvement of lanthanide-dependent dehydrogenases. We have been developing Methylorubrum (formerly Methylobacterium) extorquens into a model system for degradation of methoxylated aromatics. Recently we have uncovered that both formaldehyde stress response sensors and the lanthanide-dependent systems are needed for effective vanillic acid utilization. In our current project, we discovered that the aromatic backbone converts acetyl-CoA and ß-ketoadipate into acetoacetate and succinyl-CoA, this allows carbon to flow efficiently into the species’ high-flux glyoxylate-regeneration pathway from which our target product, butanol, is produced. An advantage of targeting butanol is that the same glyoxylate-regeneration pathway is naturally used to generate the internally-accumulated compound, poly-ß-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). As such, we leverage PHB as a reporter, a visualizable single-cell proxy for production capacity through this pathway that can guide our design process. We have found that a fundamental challenge to developing M. extorquens into a catalyst for conversion of lignin-derived methoxylated aromatics into butanol is that populations exhibit tremendous cell-to-cell variability in key phenotypes. We have discovered significant heterogeneity in growth, viability, PHB production, and even internal accumulation of lanthanide granules. We hypothesize that the physiological thresholds that lead to cell-to-cell variability will also exist for mutations or environmental variables that affect the same processes. Indeed, we have observed examples of both genetic interactions between beneficial mutations and with environmental parameters such as substrate concentration consistent with this hypothesis. This variability amongst cells and the fundamental role of stress responses indicate that stability of growth and production, and not just catalytic capacity, is paramount to develop effective growth and production from these difficult feedstocks. Our project combines genome-scale approaches that will broadly identify the physiological hurdles cells face in growth and production from vanillic acid with a suite of single-cell approaches to examine phenotypic heterogeneity. In particular, a new optical method developed by Vasdekis to assay PHB in single, live cells will permit us to examine the correlations between growth, stress response, and production in an unprecedented manner. Using a model of heterogeneity as a guide, we can then combine our learnings from genetic underpinnings and their impact on single-cell physiology to develop improved strains of M. extorquens for conversion of vanillic acid to butanol. In the process, we will develop and demonstrate a novel approach that embraces phenotypic heterogeneity as a major source for future innovation in DOE-relevant biosystems design."

As carbon dioxide concentrations increase, temperatures warm, and precipitation patterns shift, it is crucial to understand how plants will respond in order to plan for future changes in fresh water availability. This project will work to understand how and why vegetation changes with climate, assess the performance of land-surface models that simulate these processes, and evaluate how well these models may represent future risks associated with freshwater availability, such as changes in drought or long-term aridity. We will perform a model-by-model evaluation of the state-of-the-art collection of Earth System Models (known as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, or CMIP6, class of models), with a heightened focus on the Department of Energy’s E3SM model. We will seek to understand how representations of vegetation within these models influence simulations of freshwater availability, with a specific focus on droughts defined by soil moisture and runoff. Three questions will drive our research: (1) how do errors in how vegetation is modeled impose inaccuracies in how past droughts are simulated?; (2) how do these errors affect assessments of future drought risks as atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to rise?; and (3) where should model development focus to improve representations of vegetation and reduce uncertainties in projections of freshwater availability? Our approach will translate projections of freshwater availability and their uncertainties into risk assessments that will be relevant for stakeholders and decision makers."

A detailed functional and structural understanding of plant respiratory mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) complexes is essential to understand the fundamental mechanisms of biological energy conversion. By applying expertise in mitochondrial-membrane-protein biochemistry and structure biology, the PI recently obtained cryoEM structures of the protein complexes CI*, CIII2, CIV and SC III2+IV from Vigna radiata (mung bean)—the first high-resolution structures for mitochondrial complexes and supercomplexes for any plant. The project will characterize the plant-specific features of these and other plant mitochondrial respiratory complexes and supercomplexes functionally and structurally, using biochemical and biophysical approaches including chromatographic purifications, single particle cryoEM, and enzyme-kinetic analyses. A deep structural/functional understanding of the components of plant mETC will provide insights into bioenergy conversion. This research will test hypotheses generated by the PI’s recent structures to answer longstanding mechanistic questions such as the catalytic function of CI’s carbonic anhydrase domain and the interplay between CIII2’s dual roles. The research will also test novel hypotheses triggered by the structures, such as the potential functional role of CI*. These studies may produce additional breakthrough structures that will enable new detailed hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of these plant complexes and supercomplexes. The project will shed light on the fundamental tenets of electron transport in plant mitochondria and will generate approaches, materials, and hypotheses for the continued mechanistic examination of energy-converting enzymes in plants, advancing the field of plant respiration and bioenergetics.

Radiant solar energy represents an abundant national resource, but widespread implementation is impeded by daily and seasonal variability. The high energy density of chemical bonds makes chemical fuels an ideal solution for intermediate or long-term energy storage, as well as transportation applications. Solar energy is primarily generated in the form of electricity; therefore, electrocatalysts are necessary to convert electrical energy into chemical energy. A convenient fuel cycle would utilize renewable electricity to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) to liquid fuels, which are easily integrated into our current energy infrastructure. The proposed research focuses on understanding the thermodynamic requirements for catalytic reduction of CO2 to liquid fuels. Catalysts for these reactions typically operate at very negative electrochemical potentials, restricting their utility and often resulting in decreased energetic efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we describe a strategy for catalytic reduction inspired by the active site of natural enzymes. Chemical bonds are the energy currency of nature, so enzymes are optimized for efficient generation and utilization of chemical fuels. Several synthetic platforms specifically designed to utilize this approach will be pursued. The new synthetic platforms will also be suited for more broadly exploring redox catalysis that involves proton transfer. These fundamental studies are key to understanding energy transduction in chemical reactions. The proposed work is structured to elicit fundamental information about redox reactions as well as and establish general considerations for catalyst development."

MPEAs represent a rapidly growing area of alloy research, with reports of novel materials exhibiting greatly improved properties, especially regarding mechanical behavior. MPEAs are also known as ""high-entropy alloys"" or ""compositionally complex alloys"", and a generally accepted requirement is that they contain five or more alloying elements. This leads to a wide range of possible alloy compositions and an even broader spectrum of microstructures and properties. Systematic evaluations of certain MPEA systems have been performed, and these have yielded promising MPEAs, often with simple stoichiometries. However, understanding how deviations from stoichiometric compositions influence certain mechanical properties has been hindered by the experimental difficulty of producing and studying sufficiently wide alloy variations in a systematic and feasible manner. Addressing this bottleneck will provide fundamental knowledge relating alloying effects to mechanical behavior in MPEAs and will facilitate the discovery and design of new, high performance structural alloys. This project will include collaborations with scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), whose work will complement that performed at the University of Kentucky (UK) and lead to greater success. Dr. Daryl Chrzan and Dr. Mark Asta will perform computational work that informs the PI's experimental efforts in two ways: for MPEA systems that we have identified for study, computation will offer predictions of how mechanical properties (e.g. strength or ductility) can be improved by appropriate shifts in alloy composition; additionally, their computational work has already identified a refractory MPEA system of interest, which should exhibit enhanced ductility as Mo is replaced by Nb, and the PI's group will study the relevant processing-structure-property links. Dr. Andrew Minor will perform high temperature nanoindentation studies and characterization experiments that will help identify suitable MPEAs with promising mechanical properties at elevated temperature. This project is guided by several hypotheses: that the optimal composition within a given MPEA system is not necessarily stoichiometric; that a thin film combinatorial approach will prove to be an efficient way to perform first-pass screening in alloy systems and to identify promising candidate MPEA compositions for subsequent fabrication in bulk form for comprehensive mechanical testing; that size effects in MPEAs will be less significant than in traditional alloys, due to lattice strain and inherently higher resistance to dislocation motion in MPEAs; that the ductility of an MPEA can be significantly improved by exchanging one element for another, but remaining within the same MPEA system (constituent elements and phase). We will use combinatorial materials science and thin film sample processing to create samples with two-dimensional gradients that allow us to interrogate a broad range of compositions and identify MPEAs with relatively simple microstructures (ideally single phase; homogeneous distribution of elements across alloy grains; no intermetallic phases) and desirable mechanical properties. These candidate compositions and microstructures will guide the fabrication of bulk MPEAs via casting and heat treatment, followed by mechanical behavior studies and characterization of deformation microstructure. The overarching goal of this project is an improved understanding of processing-structure-property links in MPEAs, specifically the effects of alloy composition on mechanical behavior, with a focus on ductility. Fundamental understanding will be built on the combined experimental-computational efforts in this project, which will inform each other and lead to greater overall success."

While microorganisms have been engineered to break down plant waste and turn released sugars into products, this remains an energy-intensive process that requires expensive pre-treatment and separation steps. Furthermore, it is difficult to engineer all desirable traits for breakdown and conversion into a single microorganism. This project will develop a new strategy to break down plant biomass inspired by the microbial partnerships found in the digestive tract of grazing herbivores (e.g. cows, goats, sheep). A diverse team of microbes in the rumen of large herbivores work together to liberate sugars from crude plant biomass and convert that sugar to nutrients for the animal. These microbial consortia consist of fungi, bacteria, and archaea that form tight associations, which divide-and-conquer the difficult tasks of lignocellulose conversion. This project will leverage a “synthetic rumen” consortium composed of anaerobic fungi and chain-elongating bacteria to study which chemical metabolites are shared and exchanged between microorganisms and identify strategies to bolster lignocellulose conversion to value-added products. Our approach will develop high-throughput systems and synthetic biology tools to realize stable synthetic consortia that route plant waste into short and medium chain fatty acids (SCFAs/MCFAs) rather than methane. Key research objectives are to (1) design and predict anaerobic fungal and bacterial consortia that efficiently convert plant biomass into medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), (2) understand how cultivation parameters and microbe-microbe interactions regulate and drive microbiome metabolic fluxes, and (3) use genomic editing to alter the fermentation byproducts of anaerobic fungi and bolster MCFA titers and yields."

Trapped radium ions will be used to synthesize trapped radium-based molecules and study their properties with quantum logic spectroscopy, a quantum information technique that was originally developed for optical atomic clocks that has recently been applied to molecules. With radium-based molecules the project will also be able to study properties of the radium nucleus and set the stage for using radioactive molecules to address profound questions centered on time symmetry violation, such as why is the Universe filled with matter, but lacks antimatter? A few rare radionuclides have massive octupole shape deformations, e.g. radium-225 and protactinium-229, which makes them exceptionally sensitive to time symmetry violating or equivalently charge parity violating physics. When these special nuclei are incorporated into a molecule, they can gain a further thousand-fold sensitivity enhancement due to the molecule’s intense electric field. The combined nuclear and molecular sensitivities may be exploited to search for a tiny time symmetry violation signal using just a single trapped molecule."

We describe a program that integrates theory and experiment to expose molecular-level paradigms that are inferred, but not generally subjected to critical experimental verification in measurements of macroscopic systems. Our goal is to provide experimental benchmarks and observables on precisely controlled molecular assemblies that are sufficiently complex to capture the many-body effects that drive macroscopic behavior, but are small enough to be addressed with accurate theoretical methods. Because water is the most important medium for chemistry in nature, we have focused much of our recent effort on clarifying the molecular-level mechanics that drive the speciation and dynamics of aqueous solutes, with specific focus on the hydrated proton. Our experimental approach exploits the unique properties of temperature-controlled, size-selected clusters, whose properties are measured with custom-built instruments designed specifically for this task. To accomplish the goal of tracing the molecular origins of bulk behavior, it is essential to develop experimental methods that go beyond structural characterization of systems at low temperature, which has heretofore been our primary focus. We are therefore dedicating considerable effort to extend our methods to address the properties of larger and more complex systems at elevated temperatures. These include integration of a commercial high-resolution mass spectrometer and the demonstration of a way to monitor chemical reactions and structural rearrangements as a function of time under ambient conditions in a closed, finite system. This effectively creates microscopic “test tubes” in which chemical reactions and structural rearrangements can be followed in a regime that unveils the roles-great and small-of all the atoms in the assembly. Importantly, these methods are generally applicable, and we propose to pursue a practical application of our capabilities in which we elucidate the local, molecular-level interactions that underlie the macroscopic behavior of room temperature ionic liquids (ILs). The IL effort is currently being carried out in close collaboration with the Wishart group at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and is motivated by the increasingly important role ILs are playing as media that can be tailored for specific applications, ranging from green solvents to catalysis to satellite thrusters. With these experimental tools now available in the Johnson Lab at Yale, we are poised to usher in a new era where chemical and physical processes under thermal control can be studied in systems that are sufficiently small to enable accurate theoretical modeling, but still large enough to capture the behaviors of processes at interfaces and in the bulk. As such, we aim to provide stringent tests of the efficacy of theoretical models currently employed to simulate bulk phenomena. We recognize that complementary theoretical expertise will be required to accurately treat strongly anharmonic spectra and the thermal behavior of large systems. To meet this challenge, we have expanded the theory team (Kenneth Jordan, U. Pittsburgh) by adding Anne McCoy (U. Washington) in recognition of her unique ability to extract physical insight from the complex spectra often displayed by ionic clusters."

In order to accomplish the proposed research, we have assembled a diverse team of scientists; this includes team members from the classical and quantum computer science communities working together with experts in quantum characterization and control, applied mathematics, and physics. The noise characterization and mitigation thrust area will focus on integrating noise characterization and error mitigation within the compiler tool chain for both physical and algorithmic layer error mitigation. Understanding the underlying noise processes in the single and multi-qubit setting is a key aspect to developing optimized control and error mitigation techniques for quantum computing hardware. By incorporating noise characterization protocols in conjunction with control and error mitigation techniques, we will realize an automated tool chain for enacting noise-tailored error mitigation and optimization for specific hardware environments. In the quantum programming and compilation thrust will investigate how classical programming paradigms such as approximate computing and probabilistic programming can be applied in the quantum case. Our intention is to use these techniques to further optimize the quantum program in the presence of noise."

Investigations of multi-spin molecular systems are important to molecular and nanoscale optical-thermal energy conversion, magnetic exchange-modulated photoprocesses, and in particular, quantum information science (QIS). The research will advance understanding of how photogenerated quantum (spin) bits (qubits) can be used to develop large ground state spin polarizations on an ultrafast timescale, photoentangle multiple ground-state qubits, employ antenna effects to enhance the spin polarization signal response, and markedly decrease excited state lifetimes to increase the timescale for qubit manipulation in the ground state. The long-term goal is to develop novel molecular systems that can be optically initiated to enable magnetic exchange-mediated multi-qubit entanglement, and by virtue of designed short-lived excited states, facilitate large spin qubit polarizations in recovered ground states. This may allow the development of spatial and temporal control of spin qubits, as well as promote spin coherence lifetimes that are markedly longer than the spin initiation process."

It is widely appreciated that materials become catalysts only in reaction conditions, after undergoing important transformation induced by the temperatures of catalysis, pressures, and high coverage with reacting species. This project focuses on heterogeneous catalysts that are not only set in motion by the reaction conditions, but also never stop transforming, and whose dynamics is thus an integral part of the catalysis. Two important classes of catalysts that belong to this type are small clusters of noble metals deposited on supporting surfaces of oxides, and inversely, small clusters and thin films of oxides on metallic surfaces. These catalysts, in catalytic conditions, can exhibit multitude of shapes, stoichiometries, and adsorbate coverages, characterized by varying nature and number of active sites, and forming a statistical ensemble that evolves together with the reaction. All the properties of the catalysts (e.g. reaction rates, stabilities, spectral signatures) are ensemble-averages, but can be dominated by different members of the ensemble, e.g. spectra would be dominated by the most stable species, whereas rates would be dominated by most active and often minority species. Ensemble representation is therefore the only way to explain and predict experimental observations. Theoretical modelling is a key approach for this purpose, but it is incredibly challenging, due to the high number of configurations that the catalysts and the bound adsorbates can adopt. We develop protocols and efficient methods that enable the computational description of highly dynamic catalysts in a statistical ensemble representation, in realistic conditions. Our multi-scale methodology, that is openly distributed, combines first-principle calculations, global optimization and novel sampling strategies, statistical thermodynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics, computational spectroscopy, and machine learning descriptor-based assessments of activity. In collaboration with experiment, we tackle two catalytic reactions: the oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbon molecules (propane, cyclohexane) catalyzed by metallic clusters on supported alumina, and CO2hydrogenation to methanol catalyzed by oxide clusters supported on metals. Once the efficient protocols and models are developed, we computationally manipulate the catalysts systems, by varying temperature, partial pressures of gases, and cluster size and alloying, to achieve the exposure of the most active binding sites, and desired catalytic efficiency. We also exploit fluxionality as a lever in catalyst design, making testable suggestion to the experiment for the improvement of the catalyst. The main product of this research is the conceptual understanding of dynamic heterogeneous catalytic interfaces and their catalytic properties, the development of physically-sound recipes for the predictions and development of such catalysts, and the creation of software for modeling such catalysts using dynamical statistical ensembles of low energy configuration."

The market value of these high performance materials significantly exceeds the fuel and heat value of coal, which illustrates there are sustainable market forces for manufacturing carbon materials from coal. Current processes pose significant challenges associated with the substantial chemical modifications of the native coal structures that require high temperatures and/or strongly oxidative, highly corrosive reagents. General statement of how this problem is being addressed. An innovative approach for producing high value, carbon-based products from coal feedstocks for the manufacturing of high performance materials for electrochemical applications was proposed. The low environmental footprint process requires minimal reagent usage, efficient recycling (>90%) and produces a carbon product for electrochemical applications with >200X higher value than the coal price. In addition, the process generates valuable byproducts such as minerals and low emission gaseous fuels. What was done in Phase I and Phase II? In Phase I, the feasibility of the approach was successfully demonstrated. Domestic coal feedstocks were demonstrated in scalable processes to produce the high performance material, and battery electrodes for the next generation lithium ion batteries were produced. In the Phase II Base, production scale up of the target carbon product was demonstrated. The process production and performance was validated by a carbon manufacturer. Techno-economic analysis demonstrated viability of the process. What is planned for the Phase II project? The proposed Phase IIA program will complete the scope of the Phase II Base and will provide enhanced objectives: (a) the scale-up of carbon production (multi-kilogram scale); (b) demonstration of a product in battery electrode applications (pouch cells); (c) extensive characterization of properties for additional target applications; (d) increased fidelity for the techno-economic model that will be used for technology transition. Collaboration with a carbon manufacturer will develop a plan for profitable conversion of coal to high conductivity carbon on the multi-ton scale and enable the technology transition into Phase III commercial production. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits (limited to the space provided). The proposed approach will demonstrate an economically viable process to produce high value, carbon materials from coal feedstocks. These materials will have a much higher market value than the fuel value of coal, and thus will provide a sustainable market for their manufacturing. In addition, the proposed process will generate valuable co-products that can be integrated with other commercial operations such as the recovery of trace elements and low-emission energy production."

The development of methods to synthesize N&shy;–H and C–H bonds directly from dihydrogen at thermodynamic potential without the generation of stoichiometric waste is a long-standing challenge in catalysis. This proposal explores new catalytic chemistry and the associated fundamental molecular science to accomplish this objective. Proton coupled electron transfer is at the core of our approach and relies on transition metal hydrides to serve the dual purpose of activating dihydrogen but also promoting formation of weak N–H and C&shy;–H bonds in catalytic intermediates. Rhodium catalysts have been discovered that promote the hydrogenation of a host of N-heteroarenes as well as a manganese nitride to form ammonia, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach and providing the foundation for future studies. In cases where intermediate bond strengths are below the range accessible with thermal methods, photodriven catalytic reactions are proposed. Bifunctional metal hydrides will be developed that serve the dual purpose of activating molecular hydrogen and harvesting visible light. Computational studies and initial experiments support C–H and N&shy;–H bonds as low as 25 kcal/mol will be accessible with this approach. These concepts will be applied to weak element–hydrogen bond formation in a host of industrially and energy relevant catalytic transformations such as thehydrogenation of aromatic molecules, used in commodity chemicals, and potential hydrogen storage liquids."

Control of charge and spin transfer in materials is essential for the function of energy capture and conversion devices, and may also enable new classes of materials of value in the electronics industry. The project builds on discoveries of the research team associated with the handedness or chirality of structures at the nanoscale and the influence of this handedness on charge and spin transport. The team brings together theoretical and experimental expertise to understand the function of novel and complex assemblies that use chirality to generate novel function. Substantial progress was made in the last grant period to determine how the structure and assembly of nanoparticles influence charge transport, revealing a rich interplay between the electronic density of states, chirality, and electronic structure. Importantly, the team discovered that the chirality of molecular and nanoscale objects can influence charge transport kinetics in surprising ways, and that the effects uncovered may confer beneficial new properties on the nanostructures. In the next grant period, the team will build upon these findings to explore how chiral molecules, chiral nanostructures, and circularly polarized light interact with one another to influence the polarization and transport of charge and spin at the nanoscale. This research program will use the richness and atomistic precision of chemistry to imprint chirality onto nanoscale objects in ways that influence charge and spin alignment and transport at multiple length scales. Chiral molecules and nanostructures can exhibit unusual electronic and magnetic properties, including electron spin filtering and directed charge transfer; but the underlying mechanism(s) giving rise to these properties are poorly understood. The objectives of our activities are to develop design principles to guide the study of chiral nanomaterials and to discover novel properties that emerge from the motion of electrons and spins in these structures. The proposed studies involve a rich interplay of theory and experiment. The project involves three major activities, described in these three tasks: Task 1 will elucidate mechanisms to imprint chirality onto the electronic charge distributions in semiconductor nanoparticles. While considerable effort has been expended to establish strategies to synthesize and characterize chiral nanomaterials, fundamental studies into the physical mechanism(s) that underlie chiral imprinting are lacking. We use both experimental methods of fabricating nanoscale structures and of characterizing them with spectroscopy to distinguish among possible chiral imprinting mechanisms, with the goal of developing predictive models and guidelines to produce nanoparticles with customized chiral imprints and to produce novel charge and spin transport. Methods of theory, modeling, and simulation will be used to assist in structural design and interpretation of the experimental findings. Task 2 will study directed charge transfer in chiral structures by examining how the charge transfer rate depends on the chirality of charge (and spin) localizing species. The studies underpinning this task build on our recent finding that nanoparticle-nanoparticle charge transfer depends on the nanoparticle chirality. We will pursue two complementary approaches to investigate these effects: photoinduced electron transfer in nanoparticle dyads measured with photophysical methods, and the measurement of energy transfer in chiral nanoparticle assemblies using similar methods. Methods of theory, modeling, and simulation will be used to design the experimental systems and to explain the measured transport rates. Task 3 examines spin transfer in chiral structures that select the electron’s spin orientation. These investigations will build upon our recent findings on chiral perovskite materials and chiral metal-containing peptide crystals. The materials are multiferroic, displaying both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties, and offer new opportunities to control the spin properties of matter at the nanoscale. These studies will employ measurements of magneto-optical effects, X-ray diffraction, general tools of spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, transport, and magneto-resistance measurements. Methods of theory, modeling, and simulation will be used to interpret the experimental findings. The diverse skills of the collaborative team will enable them to build a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with the influence of the handedness of molecular and nanostructures on the flow of charge and spin across length and time scales. This understanding may have broad long-term applications in energy capture and conversion technologies, and in establishing new and novel classes of electronic structures and devices."

EPCAPE provides a unique opportunity to explore the properties of newly formed and aged marine particles and the relationships between particle composition and cloud formation. Our approach will combine direct measurements of size-selected ultrafine particles together with measurements of size-selected ultrafine particle hygroscopicity and vola­tility. While the focus of this project is on the formation and evolution of ultrafine particles in a marine setting, the measurements and insights gained will be directly applicable to the formation and evolution of larger particles, with implications for air quality and climate in this important urban region. Based on our prior measurements, we hypothesize that ultrafine marine particles are composed of varying amounts of sea salt and primary organic compounds and these particles likely further evolve in the atmosphere from the uptake of secondary inorganic and organic compounds depending on the presence of condensable vapors from the sea surface and from anthropogenic sources. Our project will have three main objectives that will directly address our hypotheses. Our first objective is the previously mentioned measurements of ultrafine particle composition, hygroscopicity, and volatility at the Mt. Soledad field site during the EPCAPE intensive observation period. Our second objective is to analyze our data, leveraging other relevant observations, in order to understand the dominant species and processes responsible for ultrafine particle formation in this setting. Several data products will be generated and archived on the DOE ARM server that will benefit the entire scientific community. Finally, our third objective is to connect our measurements of size-resolved ultrafine aerosol properties with climatically important processes that are a major focus of EPCAPE. This includes collaborating with modelers by providing data on processes that we discover from our EPCAPE observations in order to better represent the production and sinks that govern atmospheric aerosol formation, evolution, and climate impacts."

Davidson, Assistant Professor Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering Princeton University Princeton, NJ 08540 The elastocaloric effect occurs when stress is applied to or removed from a material inducing a phase transformation, causing the material to heat up or cool down. Thus, by coupling a change in entropy between two phases to an applied stress, elastocalorics provide a potential solid-state solution to replacing the vapor compression cycle of today’s refrigeration. Notably, elastomeric elastocalorics are capable of achieving tremendous performance for orders of magnitude smaller applied stress than other leading elastocaloric candidates such as shape metal alloys. Relative to conventional elastomeric elastocalorics, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit a distinct mechanotropic phase transition, enabling excellent elastocaloric performance at small strains and stresses. However, LCE elastocaloric performance remains limited by the magnitude and sharpness of the mechanotropic phase transition. While liquid crystal small molecules and polymers undergo sharp first order phase transitions, these transitions are substantially broadened in liquid crystal elastomers. Non-homogenous internal stress fields are a primary driver of the observed continuous phase transition in liquid crystal elastomers and limit the magnitude and sharpness of the elastocaloric response. Improving the elastocaloric response requires driving the phase change towards classical first order behavior throughout the bulk of the material. The objective of the proposed work is to experimentally develop a fundamental understanding of how structure and heterogeneity across scales control phase behavior in liquid crystal elastomers. Specifically, we will investigate the effects of structure on the thermotropic and mechanotropic phase transitions by probing (1) local network inhomogeneities arising from entanglements, dispersity between crosslink sites and uncontrolled junction functionality, (2) network ‘memory’ of stress inhomogeneities associated with liquid crystalline domain boundaries and the templated phase of the LCE, and (3) sequence-level molecular tuning to decouple the latent heat of the mechanotropic phase transition from the transition temperature. To achieve this, we will leverage a new LCE synthetic approach that will enable the synthesis of monodisperse sequence-controlled main chain liquid crystalline polymer precursors to create complementary tetrafunctional elastomer precursors. We will also use advanced morphological characterization techniques to identify changes in elastomer structure, phase, and heterogeneity, and to quantify the phase behavior and elastocaloric response. The understanding developed here is anticipated to provide design rules that will enable the rational design and synthesis of next-generation high performance elastomeric elastocalorics suitable for energy-efficient, solid-state refrigeration.

Nuclear energy is of great interest as a cost-effective alternative to the traditional carbon-based fossil fuels (i.e. coal and crude oil) that currently supply about 85% of the energy used globally. However, one of the key challenges for innovative closed fuel cycles is the economic isolation of noble gases, Xe and Kr, from the off-gas waste stream that evolves from reprocessing spent fuels. Currently, the only commercial process that is used to separate these gases is cryogenic distillation which is an energy-intensive and costly process. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown great promise in this application due to their porous and selective nature, although their manufacture is not scalable with current processes. With this SBIR grant, Tetramer’s expertise in MOFs and specialty material manufacturing will be leveraged to produce a lab-scale continuous process of the targeted MOFs and ensure that the resulting materials exhibit the desired properties and their production is cost-effective. Resultant MOFs developed during this SBIR program will be characterized via X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, BET surface area, and Xe/Kr capacity. The high selectivity of these MOFs has the potential to significantly reduce the volume of radioactive waste and provide a means to remediate spent nuclear fuel. The development of a continuous process will significantly increase the technology readiness of MOFs for applications in nuclear waste separations and enhance the commercial value of MOFs in additional applications such as water treatment, chemical/biological agent decontamination, and gas separations. Tetramer will work with current companies in nuclear waste management to support the developing market for innovative nuclear fuel cycles and capture the value from noble gas products."

Solar Dynamics (SD) proposes to develop and test an advanced version of our SunRing™ heliostat that reduces its total installed and proves its bankability for commercial installations. The advanced SunRing heliostat will have an installed cost 40% lower than current commercial heliostats. Phase 1 of the project focuses on developing cost saving advances in the SunRing’s novel azimuth drive moving from a conceptual to a final design supported by physical component testing. Extended outdoor testing of the baseline SunRing will also occur providing additional experience with the overall azimuth drive design approach. Phase 1 will be followed by commercialization steps in Phase 2 where the SunRing heliostat is transitioned from a Technology Readiness Level of 5 to 7. This is accomplished with 1-year of outdoor performance testing by a USA National Laboratory. Additionally, lifetime performance testing will occur on the SunRing’s drives. The focus of Phase 2 is to de-risk the technology and provide comfort in the SunRing’s ability to perform in commercial solar projects. This is critical to gain the investment needed to deploy the SunRing at commercial scale. Our team is well suited to propose this project. SD has built and deployed the baseline SunRing heliostat.

Additionally, these datasets are high-dimensional, and often use non-uniform and unstructured meshes. Scientists are principally interested in quantities of interest that are derived from raw data. Thus, it is important that the methods quantify the impact of data reduction not only on the primary data outputs but also on these quantities of interest.

Thus, bioenergy crops are more reliant on microbial-driven organic N sources and turnover for nutrition than food crops. Root exudates are thought to play a critical role in recruiting and maintaining beneficial microbes including those that make N available to the plant. Up to 25% of all photosynthetically fixed carbon is released into the rhizosphere through root exudates. These exudates provide a critical source of nutrition for diverse microorganisms and are composed of many compounds including organic acids, amino acids, and mono- and polysaccharides. However, it is unclear if this exchange of exudates for plant benefits holds during the night, when the plants are not photosynthesizing. Unraveling the nature of plant and microbial drivers behind these dynamic interactions is crucial for understanding the dynamics of N cycling and uptake in the rhizosphere. We will investigate how exudate and bacterial community engineering will enable structuring of rhizosphere communities that enhance N supply and/or reduce microbial competition for organic N thereby increasing plant nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). This project will couple novel lab and field studies to develop the first predictive model of grass-microbiomes based on new mechanistic insights into dynamic plant-microbe interactions in the grasses Sorghum bicolor and Brachypodium distachyon. The results will be used to predict plant mutants and microbial amendments, which improve low-input biomass production and validate these predictions in lab and field studies. Specifically, we will determine the mechanistic basis of dynamic exudate exchange in the grass rhizosphere. A specific focus will be on the identification of plant transporters and proteins that regulate root exudate composition and how specific exudates select for beneficial microbes that increase plant biomass and NUE. We will use stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry methods to quantify N flow between plants and microbes and use plant mutants to identify plant genes that influence exudation. We will develop predictive genome-scale rhizosphere models that are grounded in lab and field data. These models will be used to predict plant growth and exudate metabolism to maximize N flux to the plant as a function of light and N availability over a diurnal cycle. Finally, we will use these models to design genetic and microbial interventions that are tailored to increase plant biomass production under N limited conditions by optimizing plant-microbe interactions. We will also design and test the effects of amendments added at different times of the day and night to increase plant productivity by altering the microbiome to alleviate N limitation. The most favorable and robust approaches will be tested under marginal field conditions. This highly innovative and interdisciplinary study will link rhizosphere activity and root exudate components to plant productivity at a mechanistic level – knowledge that is currently lacking. This new knowledge will greatly improve our ability to increase the productivity of bioenergy and other crops grown under low input conditions.

Applications include linear algebra problems in extreme dimensions (e.g. the determination of electronic ground states of chemical systems), simulation of extreme events in complex stochastic dynamical systems (e.g. conformational transitions in molecules and cascade failure in power systems), and parameter fitting from data by efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo. The solutions to many of today's grand challenge problems can be expressed as averages with respect to various sources of randomness (e.g. from unresolved physical effects). The dominant paradigm for estimating such an average is to run multiple, non-communicating copies of the simulation and then to average the results. In contrast, the proposed ensemble simulation techniques intentionally introduce limited carefully designed communication between the copies to achieve problem-specific goals, such as: incorporation of information from observed data; exploration of rare events of acute physical interest; or faster relaxation of a dynamical system to equilibrium. The proposed ensemble schemes are ideally suited to fully exploit emerging, multi-core and many-core computational systems. In addition to impacting problems naturally stated in terms of statistical averages, the proposed ensemble approaches also suggest exciting fast randomized alternatives to the classical iterative numerical linear algebra schemes that form the foundation of modern scientific computing. The proposed fast randomized iterative techniques allow, for example, the solution of partial differential equations in dimensions well beyond the range of deterministic methods."

The reactions are simple, often one-pot procedures that allow the isolation of f-element complexes from readily available starting materials, which is a major potential advantage for extending this work to transuranic elements. Such robust dehydration synthetic methods facilitate access to unprecedented solid phases which need to be considered in computational studies of advanced nuclear fuels and separations. Our approach allows us to tune unique variables which cannot be manipulated in molecular solvents, including both the structure of each of the ions in our ionic liquids independently and the conditions under which the ionic liquid can be used. We will use these newly developed synthetic methodologies to map out the accessible solid state space of targeted and serendipitous N-donor f-element complexes, targeting eventual new plutonium(III and IV) complexes with our collaborators. A library of complexes with azoles of tunable basicity will allow better computational studies into the nature of metal-nitrogen interactions as a function of ligand electron donor character linking observed behavior unambiguously to the electronics of the unidentate ligands independently of the effects of molecular geometry. We have also found that bridging azoles of a specific geometry can capture f-element hydrolysis products as they are forming and crystallize a variety of inner and outer sphere modifications. We will use this ability of our approach to capture and crystallize hydrolysis products to try and understand mechanistically how they form and how they interact with other contaminant ions. Structural characterization of these modifications will provide support to a computational understanding of the mechanism of colloid formation, growth, and control over their formation. This research will be extended to plutonium chemistry, perhaps with an ability to control plutonium hydrolysis. This research takes advantage of newly developed tools to access novel fundamental f-element chemistry with unprecedented breadth and simplicity. In addition to providing new insights in this area of great importance to the nuclear industry, we believe the new results generated from this research will reinvigorate experimental actinide chemistry in small academic labs in the U.S. A fundamental understanding of the differences in the weak soft donor f-element interactions will facilitate the design of new extractants and new systems, enabling these systems to be designed to retain their selectivity while addressing the challenges related to operating conditions in the nuclear industry. The research will not just further the understanding of f-element chemistry but also develop tools which will allow academic institutions in the U.S. and around the world to do the same. The discovery-driven, accessible nature of the research makes it ideal for capturing the interest of students in a university research environment. We expect that the exciting fundamental science and high social relevance of this project will attract a wide range of students with diverse professional interests to the fields of radiochemistry and heavy element chemistry."
RESPONSE OF SUBSURFACE NITROGEN-CYCLING MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES TO ENVIRONMENTAL FLUCTUATIONS,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019119,"Francis, Christopher",Christopher.Francis@boardoftrusteesofthelelandstanfordjunioruniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Response of Subsurface Nitrogen-Cycling Microbial Communities to Environmental Fluctuations Christopher Francis, Stanford University (Principal Investigator) Nicholas Bouskill, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (co-Principal Investigator) PUBLIC ABSTRACT Floodplains are hot spots for biological productivity that drive biogeochemical reactions and moderate ground and surface water quality, carbon turnover, and regional land-atmosphere interactions. Within the semi-arid upper Colorado River Basin (CRB) and intermountain west, a large fraction of shallow subsurface organic carbon (C) is believed to reside within organic-enriched, fine-grained sediments embedded within low-productivity coarse organic-poor sand-and-cobble alluvium. These organic-rich sediments support sulfate-reducing conditions and are consequently referred to as &lsquo;naturally-reduced zones&rsquo; (NRZs). Oxygen is highly reactive with sulfides, which are abundant in NRZs, and thus does not readily penetrate into NRZs. Consequently, respiration of these large pools of reduced carbon may be controlled by the availability of alternative electron acceptors, notably nitrate. NRZs contain large inventories of nitrogen (N) and uranium (U) in the numerous contaminated DOE legacy site floodplains in the upper CRB, locations of former ore-processing activity. Concentration of these elements within NRZs slows carbon decomposition and chemically stabilizes U as U(IV). Microbial N cycling has the capability to &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; the biogeochemical nutrient supply stored within NRZs, drive C cycling, and cause U to be released to the aquifers. Nitrification links organic matter decomposition to the production of nitrite and ultimately nitrate, an oxidant of U(IV) and the primary electron acceptor for denitrification. While heterotrophic denitrification couples the oxidation of organic matter to the reduction of nitrate to gaseous products, chemoautotrophic denitrifiers can couple the oxidation of inorganic compounds like Fe2+ or sulfide (which are highly-enriched within NRZs) to nitrate reduction. Nitrification and denitrification are believed to help mediate C turnover in NRZ sediments and are the primary sources of the potent greenhouse gas, N2O. Despite their biogeochemical importance, remarkably little is currently known regarding N-cycling microbial communities within NRZs. To address this critical knowledge gap, we plan to examine microbial N cycling at a site within the shallow floodplain of Riverton, WY, which is being developed by the SLAC Groundwater Quality SFA program as a primary research site to study the impact of transient redox biogeochemistry coupled to transient transport processes on groundwater quality. This SFA is focused primarily on sulfur-iron-phosphorus-contaminant interactions. However, the large redox variations imply that the abundance and composition of soluble reactive N pools (NH4+, NO2-, and NO3-) will be highly variable throughout the year, highlighting the need to examine N transformations induced by hydrological transitions of organic-rich sediments. The overarching goal of our project is to determine how shifts in key environmental parameters and gradients impact microbial N-cycling communities/processes within subsurface sediments of Riverton, WY. To meet this goal, we will employ a powerful combination of molecular, meta-omic, biogeochemical, and modeling approaches to pursue three specific objectives: (1) to associate in situ environmental drivers of N cycling with distinct functional guilds using field measurements of pore water geochemistry and GHG fluxes from unperturbed sediment cores coupled to (bio)geochemical profiling, high-resolution sequence-based profiling, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of microbial communities over time and space; (2) determine the guild response to variation in key ecosystem drivers by using microcosms to examine the effect of environmentally-relevant conditions/perturbations on microbial community structure, transcription, and N-cycling activity; and (3) develop a dynamic ecosystem model that captures the diverse N metabolisms within the Riverton subsurface and their response to environmental pressures by utilizing the extensive community genomic and biogeochemical data obtained in Objectives 1-2. Ultimately, the proposed work will not only yield unprecedented insights into the microbial and molecular mechanisms of subsurface N-cycling, but also strongly support and build out (but not duplicate) the SLAC Groundwater Quality SFA program."
How Snow Drives the Seasonal Evolution of Land and Sea Surface Albedos in the Alaskan High Arctic,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019107,"Delamere, Jennifer",Jennifer.Delamere@universityofalaskafairbanks,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet. Identifying the cause or causes driving this “Arctic Amplification” has been the subject of many research studies over the past 50 years. Is the amplification driven by the surface-albedo feedback, the cloud-radiation feedback, or a combination of processes inside and outside Arctic boundaries? In our work, we are focusing on the surface-albedo feedback, not by performing regional or global model simulations or by examining multi-decadal satellite records, but by directly measuring the reflection of sunlight from the snow surface in the springtime during its melt evolution, when snow reflectivity matters because of increased sunlight. Our approach is to think globally but act locally by measuring a comprehensive set of surface properties and performing local model calculations that the research community can use to inform regional and global models. Snow cover on Arctic tundra and sea ice is thin and wind-blown, with the snow deposited on substrates with surface features (""relief"") nearly equal to that of the mean snow depth. As the Arctic emerges from winter, the highly reflective snow surface (reflecting 80% of incoming sunlight, for an albedo of 0.8) transforms into a surface that reflects only 20%, sometimes in just a few days. This significant drop in the amount of reflected sunlight, multiplied by the vast area covered by snow, has global climate ramifications. The Snow ALbedo eVOlution campaign (SALVO) allows us to look anew at specific processes driving these albedo changes. We hope to unravel how changes in snow albedo directly affect melt rates through detailed spatial measurements of spectral albedo, snow depth, snow stratigraphy, snow-grain characteristics, and water percolation through the snowpack. The SALVO project has four objectives: (1) to measure the variability in space and evolution in time of the albedo and snow properties on Arctic tundra and coastal sea ice, with an emphasis on understanding the albedo transition, (2) to provide the research community with an organized data catalog that links the many surface types observed during the spring melt with their albedos and other significant properties, (3) to use this rich data set to drive calculations of atmospheric radiative fluxes, atmospheric heating rates, and the surface energy balance, and (4) to put these local measurements into context against data from larger regions through the use of remote sensing data. The 2019-2020 MOSAiC expedition established a similar data set for central Arctic sea ice; the SALVO and MOSAiC campaigns together provide a unique opportunity to better quantify the processes that drive the evolution of albedo in the Arctic."

Using the genetically tractable Methanosarcina acetivorans as a model organism, we will focus on two unsolved questions that lie at the center of methanogenic metabolism. The first addresses the biosynthesis, essentiality and mechanistic function of the extensive post-translational modifications found in methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), an enzyme that plays a central role in anoxic production and consumption of methane. The second examines how low potential electrons are partitioned between donors and acceptors within the cell using small iron-sulfur proteins known as ferredoxins. Our experimental approach combines genetic, biochemical and biophysical approaches to develop a holistic understanding of the processes that govern flow of electrons during CO2 assimilation and reduction to methane, which is a central research goal of the Physical Biosciences program. The planned studies on the post-translational modification of methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) will include identification of the genes required for the installation of post-translational modifications, determination of the viability of mutants that lack these post-translational modification genes, physiological characterization of all viable mutants, and structural and biochemical characterization of unmodified MCR derivatives. Our studies of the ferredoxin-dependent electron-transfer networks in Methanosarcina will entail examination of the viability of mutants lacking each of the thirteen Methanosarcina Fd-encoding genes, establishing the protein interaction network for each ferredoxin, characterizing the metal content and redox properties for each ferredoxin, and determining the structures for each ferredoxin via protein crystallography, cryoelectron micropscopy or solution NMR."

Lamb, Columbia University (Principal Investigator) Marcus van Lier-Walqui, Columbia University & NASA GISS (Co-Investigator) Jerry Y. Harrington, Pennsylvania State University (Co-Investigator) Motivation: Depositional ice growth is an important microphysical process impacting ice cloud formation. The habits and growth rates of ice crystals are known to sensitively depend on temperature (T), pressure, and supersaturation. However, the surface effects controlling vapor deposition are complex, and challenging to characterize experimentally. Recent experiments indicate these surface effects may depend on the ice nucleation mechanism, suggesting depositional ice growth cannot be understood purely as phase partitioning between vapor and ice, but should instead be understood as an aerosol-cloud interaction, fundamentally linked to the type and availability of aerosols acting as ice nucleating particles. This lack of clear physical understanding makes it challenging to predict ice crystals habits and their growth rates in weather and climate models. The sensitivity of colder clouds (T < -20 C) to surface effects is not well understood or constrained because of the paucity of measurements at low temperatures. Recent progress on modeling surface processes on faceted ice has been made through the development of the Diffusion Surface Kinetics Ice Crystal Evolution (DiSKICE) model, which models crystal habits with two semi-axes and parameterizes surface growth mechanisms, including possible nucleation-dependent mechanisms. A recent extension of this model to “budding” bullet rosettes allows for more complex crystal habits to be modeled. The extension of the DiSKICE model to more complex crystals has been developed using single-crystal laboratory experiments, which limit constraints on processes to small ice crystals. Proposed research: Here we propose using Bayesian parameter estimation and deep learning techniques to put stronger constraints and reduce structural uncertainty in ice deposition models by combining prior laboratory measurements and observations from recent US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (DOE-ARM) facility supported field campaigns. Single-crystal laboratory and cloud chamber measurements will be used with Bayesian techniques to estimate uncertain surface parameters and constrain the growth rates of small ice crystals. Using a large data set of laboratory grown crystals will allow us to determine whether the subsequent growth of the crystals depends on how the crystals were nucleated. Machine learning approaches applied to in-situ data of crystal shapes will be used to determine the common habit characteristics needed to inform microphysical models (such as rosette arm aspect ratio, which determines the crystal density). These common characteristics, in combination with constraints derived from the lab measurements, will be used to inform Bayesian parameter estimation techniques applied to model simulations of observed cirrus. Expected outcomes: This research will provide better constrained parameterizations for the vapor growth of small ice crystals at temperatures below -40C, and dependencies on how the crystals nucleate will also be determined. Parameterizations for the combined influences of surface attachment kinetics, nucleation mechanism, and crystal effective density are expected to be produced by this research. Extrapolations of these parameterizations to larger size crystals will be accomplished as well, through the use of machine learning techniques and Bayesian parameter estimation. The parameterizations will be provided as power-laws so that they can easily be incorporated into traditional and particle-property microphysical schemes."

Polyurethane (PU) is one of the most common plastic precursors, which is widely used across various applications such as automotive, building and construction, furniture, packaging in the form of rigid and flexible foams, adhesives, coatings, sealants, elastomers, etc. The lack of new CO2 to plastic technologies and the higher cost of current CO2 conversion approaches significantly restrains their applications in many segments. Therefore, novel technologies need to transform carbon emissions into plastics with less complex industrial processes. In response to topic 23b, we proposed an innovative technology that converts industrial waste CO2 stream and algal biomass into high-value biopolyols targeting PU foam application via sustainable thermochemical pathways. The waste CO2 stream is from the anaerobic digestion process, while the digester effluent can be used for on-site algae cultivation. The achieved CO2- derived biopolyols endows controllable physicochemical properties, leading to a wide spectrum of PU foam products. In addition, the developed technologies will significantly advance the CO2 utilization technologies and unlock many industrial opportunities, particularly for polyurethane manufacturers. The overall objective of this Phase I project is to develop a novel, cost-effective approach to successfully convert waste CO2 into high-value versatile biopolyols for PU foam application. Five specific objectives and relevant activities will be carried out in this project. Extraction of lipids from algae and liquefaction of algal biomass residue to produce polyester biopolyols for rigid PU foam application. Synthesis of bio-epoxy monomer from algae lipids. Development of bio-based polycarbonate polyols via the of polymerization CO2 and epoxy monomers in the presence of a proprietary catalyst system for flexible PU foam application.

The vast majority of commodity plastics are polyolefins that come from petroleum-derived monomers that in turn contribute to their low cost and abundance. Because of their durability and because these materials were not designed with end of life in mind, they have accumulated in the environment and will become part of earth’s geologic record. Chemical recycling, whereby the plastic is returned to pristine monomer after use, offers considerable promise for the energy- and carbon-efficient reuse of the valuable carbon building blocks of polymers. This proposal combines expertise in synthetic chemistry, catalysis, polymer science, theory and simulation, and engineering to develop next-generation polyolefins prepared from established commodity feedstocks that are chemically recyclable. At the core of this approach is the discovery of an iron-catalyzed [2+2] cyclopolymerization method that converts butadiene to an unprecedented microstructure of cyclobutyl repeat units. This polymeric material is terminated with vinyl groups at both end of the backbone, enabling chemical recycling whereby re-exposure to the iron catalyst regenerates pristine butadiene. The proposed research will focus on studying the material properties of this new chemically recyclable plastic and will simultaneously explore new catalyst designs to access and understand new polymer microstructures with varied properties. Studies will also include understanding the interfacial interactions between the catalyst and the plastic to enable more efficient and targeted chemical recycling. More long-term studies will expand the concept of reversible [2+2] cycloaddition polymerization beyond butadiene to other commodity olefins with the goal of preparing a range of new materials ideally with improved properties and all with the feature of chemical recyclability."

However, despite unprecedented LCLS capabilities, the enormous complexity, data volume (current acquisition rate, 1 GB/s; projected as 200 GB/s with the LCLS-II upgrade), and experimental access constitute major challenges for scientific discovery. The proposed research will directly tackle this urgent issue by developing novel data-science methods, machine-learning (ML) approaches, and uncertainty-quantification techniques to enable ultrafast X-ray measurements that are closely supported through tightly coupled atomistic-scale simulations to discover non-equilibrium processes and chemical reactions of fluids in complex regimes. By establishing these advanced data-science approaches, the proposed research will set a paradigm for the broader scientific community to solve critical research challenges and to drive progress in applications across sectors. To enable the rapid experimental screening of the complex thermochemical state-space and the efficient exploration of non-equilibrium reaction pathways, innovative Bayesian optimization techniques will be formulated. To accelerate scientific discovery, novel data-assimilation techniques will be developed that integrate experimental measurements into molecular dynamics simulations, taking into consideration experimental uncertainties and incomplete models. Novel ML approaches will be developed for directly training force-field descriptors from X-ray measurements. These complementary data-science methods will be employed for scientific discovery of non-equilibrium processes in fluids, involving supercritical conditions, chemical reaction, and structural heterogeneities.

Bent, Stanford University (Co-Investigator) Miaofang Chi, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) The goal of this project is to reduce the amount of platinum-group elements (PGEs) in heterogeneous catalysts used in catalytic converters in automobiles. Catalytic converters account for 33% of the world’s Pt use, 85% of Pd, and 90% of Rh, and an improvement in their utilization would directly lead to a crucial decrease in our dependency on these rare and expensive metals. PGEs usage is about 400 tonnes/year, and since the automotive industry accounts for more than half of the need, an improvement in the stability for automotive emission catalysts would cut the demand of PGEs. Therefore, this project has the potential to lead to the saving of hundreds of tonnes of PGEs per year, with consequential effects on the many aspects of PGE mining and its applications. The reason for using larger amounts of Pt, Pd and Rh than necessary in catalytic converters is due to their unstable nature at high temperatures in the exhaust gas mixture, which leads to their sintering and loss of activity. Our preliminary work demonstrates an approach where Pt/Pd catalysts are active and stable under air and steam conditions above 1,000 °C. These preliminary results prompt us to investigate and understand the reasons for such unprecedented stability, as well as how to further improve these catalysts through a theory-driven approach supported by detailed operando characterization and precise synthesis. Overall, the project vision is to understand the catalytic activity and stability of PGE-containing materials and ultimately significantly improve their efficiency and reduce their usage by more than 50%. This project details fundamental science that will be developed to contribute to the DOE’s mission of producing science, technology and engineering solutions for re-establishing U.S. competitiveness in the use of critical precious elements. This project is also in line with the goals of developing hypothesis-driven research towards synthesis approaches that result in reduced and optimized use of PGEs in the technology that uses the most of these precious metals, namely, automotive emission control systems."
Quantitative Analysis of Metabolic Segregation of Lignin Deconstruction and Catabolism in Outer Membrane Vesicles of Soil Pseudomonas species,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022181,"Aristilde, Ludmilla",Ludmilla.Aristilde@northwesternuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","This research directly addresses a fundamental research need relevant to the DOE BER mission to “understand novel microbial functional capabilities and biosynthetic pathways relevant to the production of advanced biofuels and bioproducts.” Specifically, we seek to address a long-standing metabolic shortcoming for a biocatalytic platform that can efficiently couple lignin depolymerization and the carbon flux of breakdown derivatives to important product biosynthesis. For instance, white-rot fungi are notable for lignin depolymerization capabilities, but present poor biocatalytic platforms for lignin catabolism to product biosynthesis. Conversely, some soil bacteria exhibit exceptional capabilities for the metabolism of lignin-related compounds but are often incapable of substantial lignin depolymerization. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in Pseudomonads have recently been implicated in lignin depolymerization and aromatic carbon catabolism, thus offering a means to develop improved biocatalysts for these two key processes. These OMVs could be combined with the cellular metabolic versatility of Pseudomonads, which are well-known for the processing of both lignin and cellulose derivatives towards biosynthetic pathways of target products. A major knowledge gap that prevents harnessing the functional capabilities of OMVs is a quantitative understanding of their metabolic network and regulation in relation to the intracellular metabolic network. Here the research goal is to elucidate the reaction network responsible for the metabolic functionalities of the OMVs in soil Pseudomonas species with demonstrated accelerated lignin catabolism and subsequently evaluate the metabolic relationship of OMVs in fueling lignin-derived carbon fluxes towards intracellular biosynthetic pathways. This fundamental understanding is required to leverage encapsulated catabolic reactions in OMVs towards enhancing the intracellular metabolic network for concerted lignin catabolism and valorization. Our four research objectives are to (1) elucidate carbon assimilation flux from lignin deconstruction using whole-cell cultures, (2) determine OMV-localized versus intracellular reaction networks for lignin catabolism as a function of lignin derivatives, (3) characterize regulatory controls and bottlenecks of OMV-localized versus intracellular fluxes of lignin catabolism, and (4) employ synthetic OMVs and engineered Pseudomonas strains to overcome metabolic bottlenecks lignin-derived product biosynthesis. Our central hypothesis is that the metabolic fluxes encapsulated within the OMVs are dictated by the lignin composition in the nutrient media and by the metabolic limitations of the intracellular metabolic network in the associated Pseudomonas species. We will evaluate our hypothesis by employing a unique interdisciplinary approach that combines stable isotope-assisted metabolomics, proteomics profiling, genome-scale quantitative flux modeling, biomimetic tools for vesicle design, and metabolic engineering. The research outcomes aimed at achieving significant advances towards exploiting the biosynthetic processing power of microbial systems for converting lignocellulose into valuable biofuels and bioproducts. The first research outcome is to establish the metabolic network partitioning for lignin deconstruction and subsequent catabolism between OMVs and intracellular compartments of Pseudomonads. The second research outcome is to unveil the regulatory mechanisms that control favorable versus unfavorable carbon fluxes throughout the metabolic network. The third research outcome is to combine specialized synthetic vesicles with engineered cellular metabolism to overcome metabolic bottlenecks and thus promote lignin-derived product biosynthesis. Beyond advancing sustainable energy objectives, these research outcomes will provide metabolic roadmaps to guide biotechnological applications of OMV production, a widespread attribute in several bacterial species."
Optogenetic control of microbial consortia for biofuel and chemical production,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022155,"Avalos, Jose",Jose.Avalos@thetrusteesofprincetonuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Engineered microorganisms have enormous potential to produce biofuels, chemicals, and other valuable products from renewable substrates and waste. However, the genetic and metabolic burden that exogenous biosynthetic pathways impose on engineered strains negatively impact their robustness and productivity. In addition, containing a full biosynthetic pathway in a single strain (i.e., in a monoculture) prevents metabolic engineers from separately optimizing each of its components (or modules), forcing them instead to optimize the entire pathway in a single cell by making compromises that often limit productivity. This shortcoming is magnified when different modules compete with or inhibit each other. These factors greatly contribute to the insufficient productivities of most bioprocesses, and prevent them from being competitive with fossil fuels and non-sustainable manufacturing processes. Using co-cultures of more than one organism, instead of monocultures, has been proposed as a powerful solution to address these challenges. This approach draws inspiration from natural microbial processes (e.g., biomass decay, or food digestion), which are almost always carried out by microbial communities. Splitting biosynthetic pathways across multiple microorganisms would reduce the burden on each individual member and prevent negative interactions between different metabolic modules. Furthermore, the efficiency of each module would be significantly improved by optimizing them separately in specialized strains (akin to the way different parts of a chemical process are optimized in separate reactors in a chemical plant). However, stabilizing the population composition of engineered microbial consortia has proven to be a formidable challenge, with the fastest growing members usually dominating the consortia and turning them into futile monocultures. Controlling inoculation ratios and engineering clever biological orthogonalities or synthetic symbioses between members have done much to improve co-culture operations, but these strategies have still been insufficient to advance engineered consortia to commercial processes. The goal of this project is to establish a new paradigm to use optogenetics to control microbial consortia for biofuel and chemical production. Optogenetics is a field in biotechnology that uses light-responsive proteins to control biological processes. Only recently, through pioneering research done in our lab and supported by the DOE (BER), has it been possible to control metabolic activity in microbial fermentations with light inputs. Most recently, we have developed optogenetic systems to control growth rates in several microbial species, including yeast and bacteria. This capability could allow not only the stabilization of microbial consortia populations, but also their optimization for chemical production, which has thus far eluded current approaches. We have substantial preliminary data to support the feasibility of this new strategy, demonstrating optogenetic control of microbial cell growth in co-cultures to optimize populations for biofuel production, and efficient light activation of microbial functions in lab-scale bioreactors of up to at least 5L operating at high cell densities. This is achieved through the use of specialized optogenetic circuits that amplify optical inputs under light-deprived conditions. We will engineer mono- and polychromatic optogenetic controls of microbial consortia and scale them up to lab bioreactors. We will engineer these optogenetically controlled consortia with biosynthetic pathways that benefit from being fragmented into smaller modules and optimized in individual strains. We will also use optogenetically controlled consortia for consolidated bioprocesses to produce cellulosic biofuels and upcycle PET to valuable chemicals. Mathematical models and feedback controls will help us gain basic understanding of these biological systems and optimize them for chemical production. The technologies developed in this project offer an entirely new approach to engineer and control biological processes for biofuel and chemical production, which could help make engineered co-cultures operable and competitive in commercial processes."

Johnson, Yale University (Principal Investigator) Kenneth D. Jordan, University of Pittsburgh (Co-Investigator) Anne B. McCoy, University of Washington (Co-Investigator) Our description of chemical and physical processes in the condensed phase and at interfaces involves a hierarchy of theoretical approaches that integrate high-level quantum treatments of chemical rearrangements with more approximate methods to account for the long-range effects of the surrounding medium. We describe a program that integrates theory and experiment to expose molecular-level paradigms that are inferred, but not generally subjected to critical experimental verification in measurements of macroscopic systems. Our goal is to provide experimental benchmarks and observables on precisely controlled molecular assemblies that are sufficiently complex to capture the many-body effects that drive macroscopic behavior, but are small enough to be addressed with accurate theoretical methods. Because water is the most important medium for chemistry in nature, we have focused much of our recent effort on clarifying the molecular-level mechanics that drive the speciation and dynamics of aqueous solutes, with specific focus on the hydrated proton. Our experimental approach exploits the unique properties of temperature-controlled, size-selected clusters, whose properties are measured with custom-built instruments designed specifically for this task. To accomplish the goal of tracing the molecular origins of bulk behavior, it is essential to develop experimental methods that go beyond structural characterization of systems at low temperature, which has heretofore been our primary focus. We are therefore dedicating considerable effort to extend our methods to address the properties of larger and more complex systems at elevated temperatures. These include integration of a commercial high-resolution mass spectrometer and the demonstration of a way to monitor chemical reactions and structural rearrangements as a function of time under ambient conditions in a closed, finite system. This effectively creates microscopic “test tubes” in which chemical reactions and structural rearrangements can be followed in a regime that unveils the roles-great and small-of all the atoms in the assembly. Importantly, these methods are generally applicable, and we propose to pursue a practical application of our capabilities in which we elucidate the local, molecular-level interactions that underlie the macroscopic behavior of room temperature ionic liquids (ILs). The IL effort is currently being carried out in close collaboration with the Wishart group at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and is motivated by the increasingly important role ILs are playing as media that can be tailored for specific applications, ranging from green solvents to catalysis to satellite thrusters. With these experimental tools now available in the Johnson Lab at Yale, we are poised to usher in a new era where chemical and physical processes under thermal control can be studied in systems that are sufficiently small to enable accurate theoretical modeling, but still large enough to capture the behaviors of processes at interfaces and in the bulk. As such, we aim to provide stringent tests of the efficacy of theoretical models currently employed to simulate bulk phenomena. We recognize that complementary theoretical expertise will be required to accurately treat strongly anharmonic spectra and the thermal behavior of large systems. To meet this challenge, we have expanded the theory team (Kenneth Jordan, U. Pittsburgh) by adding Anne McCoy (U. Washington) in recognition of her unique ability to extract physical insight from the complex spectra often displayed by ionic clusters."

The final objective is to test the hypothesis that a thin film at the membrane surface functions as an effective ion-gating layer, and to identify major operational factors influencing selectivity and energy efficiency. Through this research, the governing transport mechanisms are elucidated for a separation paradigm that has not been previously investigated for selective removal of lanthanide ions from aqueous matrices. The longer term goal is to strengthen the foundation for novel energy-efficient extraction technologies."
Simulating long-time evolution of driven many-body systems with next generation quantum computers,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019469,"Freericks, James",James.Freericks@georgetownuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","James K. Freericks, Georgetown University, (Principal Investigator) Alexander Kemper, North Carolina State University, (Co-Investigator) We are on the cusp of entering the world of quantum computing for applications to science. While quantum computers have already existed for a few years, the current hardware is far from ideal---they do not have many qubits, the results are prone to errors, and they cannot run computer codes that are very long. The objective of our work is to find the best applications for cutting-edge science that can be studied on current and near-term quantum computers, and then design and run these algorithms in the most robust fashion with respect to potential errors. We focus on three main scientific goals for doing this: (i) describing the behavior of driven-dissipative quantum systems; (ii) creating low-energy states of frustrated quantum magnets; and (iii) generating highly entangled spin states that can be employed for improved measurements. In the first problem, we will create quantum systems in artificial electric fields that will drive current through them, but will have energy removed from them at a fixed rate. They will usually end up in a complex quantum steady state, which we will explore with the quantum computer. In the second problem, we will examine a range of different strategies to create low-energy states, of magnets that are frustrated, in the sense that they cannot point their north and south poles where they would like to, to make the lowest-energy arrangement. These systems are some of the most fascinating, but most difficult to study systems in the quantum world. We will devise quantum algorithms to explore their properties. In the third problem, we will create highly entangled states which have at their core, the &ldquo;spookiness&rdquo; of quantum mechanics. They are difficult to make and fragile, but we will employ techniques that protect them from being destroyed as we work on making them. Once we are successful, these states can be further used for ultraprecise measurements. Our approach is a combined classical-quantum computer hybrid approach, which uses the quantum computers primarily to calculate the strongest quantum effects, which are then post-processed by a classical computer to determine the final results. Our methodology is to develop robust algorithms that are resistant to errors and noise, and have a higher chance for successful operation with currently available quantum computers. We have collaborations with IBM, Intel, and the University of Maryland to ensure the ability to run these codes on real quantum hardware. We will also employ quantum computer simulators to ensure our codes are resistant to noise effects and have a high chance to run successfully on currently available quantum hardware. The impact of this project will be to set the stage for ushering in the era of quantum-computer-assisted scientific discovery. As quantum computers become more robust, we will be able to use them to tackle problems that will lead to exciting new applications of science that have an energy focus and are beneficial to society."

The defect interaction and evolution control microstructural changes during irradiation processes and determine materials&rsquo; properties and performance. The defect interaction and evolution process is multiscale in time (from femtoseconds to decades) and length (from angstroms to meters) and has been extensively studied experimentally at macroscales and at atomistic scale through modeling and simulation. However, there exists a significant gap in understanding these phenomena at mesoscales (intermediate time and length scales). Mesoscale interactions are critically important for understanding how defects lead to changes in materials&rsquo; properties and performance as they represent the transition from local atomistic events to macroscopic effects. This research aims to develop a mesoscale mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced defect interaction and evolution in pure metals and metal alloys using an approach co-developed by the PI called &ldquo;SEAKMC&rdquo; that is ideal for the research at the mesoscales where these interactions are less understood. The understanding developed will provide the basis for extending the operating life of structural materials in existing nuclear reactors and the development of next-generation structural materials for use in future nuclear energy systems. This project will also advance computational capabilities at the mesoscale, which will be widely applicable to other fields of materials science, physics, and chemistry.

NON-ABELIAN QUASIPARTICLES AND TOPOLOGICAL SUPERCONDUCTIVITY FOR QUANTUM INFORMATION SCIENCE,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0010544,"Lyanda-Geller, Yuli",Yuli.Lyanda-Geller@purdueuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Non-Abelian quasiparticles and topological superconductivity for quantum information science By: Yuli Lyanda-Geller, Purdue University Recently topological states of matter and non-Abelian particles have become an intriguing path for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Upon exchange or permutation of non-Abelian particles or quasiparticles, called non-Abelions, their quantum many-body state, which is described by a linear combination of degenerate states, transforms into a quantum state characterized by a different linear combination, and the result of two such transformations depends on their order. Research on non-Abelions has largely concentrated on Majorana zero modes theoretically studied in a number of systems, such as p-type superconductors and superfluids, the fractional quantum Hall effect, and topological insulators or semiconductor wires in proximity of an s-type superconductors. Both electron and hole systems have been studied. As Majorana fermions are not sufficient for universal quantum computing, theoretical proposals were made to explore high order non-Abelions, such as parafermions and Fibonacci anyons. For these high order non-Abelions, it was suggested to use several systems, such as exotic fractional quantum Hall states, superconductor-coupled quantum Hall edge states and superconductor-coupled bundles of nanowires. Realizing these proposals is extremely challenging, and a deeper theoretical understanding of non-Abelian systems and proposals for new feasible experimental settings are needed. So far, we have investigated several topological settings. We developed an understanding of spin-orbit interactions and proximity-induced Majorana fermions in spin-3/2 hole wires. In the fractional quantum Hall effect spin 3/2 holes system we used density matrix renormalization group to calculate the topological entanglement entropy and show the non-Abelian nature of the half-filled ground hole quantum Hall state. Studying the fractional quantum Hall effect 5/2 state in disc geometry, we showed that the in-plane electric field facilitates the non-Abelian Pfaffian state. We proposed a new setting for Majorana fermions and parafermions in domain walls of quantum Hall ferromagnets proximity-coupled to an s-superconductor. In an integer quantum Hall ferromagnet, we showed that impurity disorder facilitates Majorana fermions. We studied domain walls in fractional quantum Hall ferromagnets in disc and torus geometries, developed an approach to superconducting proximity effect and showed the emergence of the six-fold degenerate parafermion state. In this proposal we seek to extend our studies of topological superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in several important and non-trivial directions. We will develop the microscopic theory of proximity coupling of s-superconductors to p-type spin 3/2 materials, including the effects of magnetic field and strain, and study non-Abelions in this system. We will study how superconductors couple to the fractional quantum Hall systems and lead to new non-Abelian states. In particular, we will use analytic and numerical methods to study spin transitions in fractional quantum Hall ferromagnets in the presence of superconducting proximity correlations, and study emergence of parafermions in this system. We will investigate superconducting proximity coupling and non-Abelian quasiparticles in the fractional quantum Hall effect hole system. We also will study manifestation of non-Abelian quasiparticles and topological superconductivity in interference transport effects, and investigate the role of disorder."
Establishing the chelation chemistry of antimony-119 for targeted Auger therapy,Office of Isotope R&D and Production,DE-SC0023012,"Engle, Jonathan","Jonathan.Engle@boardofregentsoftheuniversityofwisconsinsystem,operatingasuniversityofwisconsin-madison","['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Targeted Auger therapy leverages Auger electron-emitting radioactive ions in conjunction with tumor- seeking biological targeting vectors to selectively deliver cytotoxic radiation to cancer cells. The ultra-short penetration range and high linear energy transfer of Auger electrons render them unparalleled in their potential for destroying small tumor burdens such as micrometastases and isolated cancer cells. Although Auger emitters have been largely overshadowed by the popularity of alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides for targeted radiotherapy, there has been a resurgence of interest in their implementation in nuclear medicine applications. This resurgence stems, in part, from recent advances in isotope production, which have paved the way for the development of exotic radioisotopes with attractive properties for medical use. One such emerging isotope is antimony-119 (119Sb), a potent Auger emitter that can be obtained from a 119mTe/119Sb generator. The production of this generator is currently supported by the DOE Isotope Program, and 119Sb is expected to become widely available in the future. A key outstanding challenge that hinders the advancement of 119Sb forward into clinical studies, however, is the lack of suitable bifunctional chelators for this underexplored radiometalloid, which are critical for stably retaining the radionuclide to the targeting vector in vivo. The objective of this research is to develop bifunctional chelating agents for 119Sb that can be implemented to deliver this Auger emitter to micrometastases and single-cell disease. Because Sb can exist in both the +3 or +5 oxidation states in aqueous solution, in Aim 1 we will initiate a two-pronged ligand design strategy directed towards developing chelators that are tailored to the unique coordination chemistries of SbIII and SbV. Our design strategy for SbIII will leverage the thiophilic character of SbIII and the geometric constraints imposed by its stereochemically active 5s2 lone pair. Our efforts for synthesizing chelators for the more oxophilic SbV ion will rely on the incorporation of hard oxygen donors to saturate its coordination sphere. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the coordination chemistry of our new ligands with radioactive 119Sb. We will perform radiolabeling studies to probe the efficiency of their complexation with 119SbIII and 119SbV and evaluate the kinetic stabilities of the resulting complexes under biological conditions. Chelators that are found to rapidly bind and stably retain 119Sb will be moved forward to Aim 3, where they will be outfitted with isothiocyanate functional groups and conjugated to a model targeting vector. These constructs will be radiolabeled with 119Sb, and their uptake and toxicity will be evaluated in vitro to establish for the first time the potential for 119Sb to reduce cancer cell survival. Furthermore, the stability of these radiolabeled constructs will be probed in biodistribution studies using tumor-bearing mice. Collectively, this research will lead to the rapid development of novel bifunctional chelators for 119Sb that can be used to deliver this Auger emitter in vivo and will serve as the foundation for future pre-clinical and clinical development of this promising radioisotope."
Investigation of the Structure of Neutron-rich Nuclei Using a Multidimensional Experimental Approach,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0023010,"Ayangeakaa, Akaa",Akaa.Ayangeakaa@theuniversityofnorthcarolinaatchapelhill,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","The study of neutron-rich nuclei has progressed remarkably in recent years due to important technological advancements in the production and acceleration of rare isotope beams and the development of ever more powerful particle and ?-ray spectrometers. Among the most striking discoveries following these developments are the observation of dramatic changes in shell structure and the appearance of new collective modes in nuclei with extreme asymmetric proton-to-neutron ratios. While these observations have significantly improved our overall understanding of structure evolution towards the drip lines, and provided considerable insight on specific terms of the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction, they also present important challenges to a unified understanding of the structure of nuclei. For example, there are uncertainties associated with the nature of intrinsic excitations in very neutron-rich nuclei and their role in driving nuclear and astrophysical processes. In addition, the possible existence of novel modes of excitation in weakly-bound systems and the impact of weak binding and extreme proton-neutron asymmetries on fundamental nuclear properties such as the shape, mass, decay modes etc have yet to be fully explored. The present study is focused on leveraging the availability of rare isotopes and high-intensity stable beams to address some of these issues by systematically probing the structure of select neutron-rich nuclei as a function of nucleon number, excitation energy and spin. In particular, the study seeks to investigate the progressive changes in shell structure due to increasing neutron excess and address fundamental physics questions related to (1) the role of specific nucleon orbitals in the development of collectivity in the N = 40 region, (2) explore shape evolution, coexistence and the role of axial asymmetry in the Mo-Ru-Pd region, (3) explore the quadrupole collectivity of isomeric structures in yttrium isotopes, and (4) exploit the nuclear resonance fluorescence technique to study the electromagnetic dipole response of nuclei. The experiments will be carried out at two primary locations: the ATLAS facility at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and HI?S facility at Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL). At ANL, nuclei of interest will be produced following multi-nucleon transfer reactions, with beams provided by the ATLAS superconducting linear accelerator. The emitted ? rays and recoil ions will be detected using the Gammasphere multi-detector array and the fragment mass analyzer (FMA), respectively. In addition, Coulomb excitation studies of shape transition, shape coexistence, and of the role of asymmetry degrees of freedom will be performed using stable and reaccelerated radioactive beams provided by the ATLAS/CARIBU systems and the GRETINA/CHICO2 arrays. Photonuclear reaction measurements at TUNL will exploit the nearly monoenergetic and linearly-polarized ?-ray beams provided by the HI?S facility to investigate low-spin dipole excitations up to the particle emission threshold, with the goal of unambiguously determining multipolarities, lifetimes, branching and mixing ratios as well as cross sections relevant to astrophysical network calculations."

Our ability to read and interpret the texts of this library has been fostered through the use of experimental model organisms that are readily studied. Over the past 100 years the fruit fly, yeast cell and Arabidopsis weed have contributed greatly to our understanding of the biological processes that unite organisms on Earth. Today, however, genomes of organisms that are difficult to culture, rare or even extinct exist in this library of life. While their genome sequences have been unlocked, the nature of the genes contributing to this fascinating diversity in physiology and development is currently hidden due to a lack of methods available to extract significant functional meaning. Which genes allow a cactus to survive the desert heat, or a sea grass plant to grow in ocean water, or some ferns to tolerate desiccation? In agriculture, domestication has led to the breeding of rapidly growing cultivars that perform well when the climate cooperates, but often fail when water or nutrients are limited. Planned cultivation of bioenergy crops on soils of poor quality is necessary so as not to compete with other agricultural sectors, yet these environments will dramatically impact biomass accumulation. If the innovations that nature has selected for across plant species can be discovered, it may be possible to address these challenges and improve the sustainability of agriculture in ways that are simply impossible by traditional breeding. Innovations in gene function allow wild plants to inhabit environments that are commonly stressful to domesticated crops. The goal of this research program is to identify such innovations by defining the regulatory and physiological context that genes function across 11 sequenced Brassicaceae genomes, including bioenergy crops, and crop wild relatives, using recent advances in genomic-approaches and artificial intelligence algorithms. A gene regulatory regulatory network will be constructed that will establish a finger print for characterizing the signaling pathways that control the expression of genes during environmental stress and predict how genetic variation alters these stress tolerance programs. Computational approaches that utilize gene duplication events and evolutionary theory will identify genetic states associated with the gain or loss of stress tolerance within the Brassicaceae plant family. Predicted gene functions controlling key root traits for bioenergy crops will be validated using advanced gene editing approaches. Together, these approaches will define gene functions through a comparative approach and identify pathways that can be leveraged for the improvement of stress tolerance in bioenergy crops."

There remain significant gaps in understanding of how the catalyst’s atomistic structure determines the activity of reactions and how it is transiently transformed under varying operating conditions. Our effort seeks to take on this challenge with a data-science-driven approach to computational modeling, joining it with advanced experimental methods of characterization to create new methods for capturing realistic complexity of reactions at heterogenous and disordered interfaces. As a prototype application we will focus on the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) CO + H2O ? CO2 +H2, as carried out over an active oxide (ceria CeO2) supported nanoscale Pt cluster catalyst. The Pt/CeO2 system is a high activity, low temperature catalyst for WGSR and one for which we have recently uncovered the central role of transient catalyst reconstruction and fluxional oscillating behavior of active sites localized at the metal-support interface. These microscopic transformations seem essential to account for the very high activities of this catalyst system, but with dynamical couplings to the reaction mechanism(s) that remain incompletely understood. This effort seeks to take on this challenge with a data-science-driven approach to computational modeling, joining it with advanced experimental methods of characterization to create new methods for capturing realistic complexity of reactions at heterogenous and disordered interfaces. Our multidisciplinary approach combines machine learning theory, accelerated molecular simulations of reactions, material synthesis, and operando in-situ spectroscopic characterization. The objectives of our effort are: - Development of highly accurate and data efficient deep neural network models of interatomic interactions incorporating physical symmetry equivariance, and uncertainty-driven active learning of kernel regression models trained on quantum first-principles calculations of heterogeneous reactions. - Adoption of nonlinear dimensionality reduction and reinforcement learning techniques for automated discovery and enhanced sampling of rare transition events and estimation of reaction rates. - Use of machine learning models of the quantum potential energy for accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to reveal mechanistic details of fluxional evolution of nanoparticle surface, shape, and support interface under reactive conditions, in order to support experimental investigations. - Experimental characterization of WGSR kinetics and mechanisms using high surface area supports and flat model systems, combined with atomistic structure analysis via microscopy and spectroscopy enhanced by neural networks, to validate and guide computations. These goals will be pursued in parallel tasks that will inform and complement each other. Experimental investigations will explore the connection between dynamic microscopic structure and catalytic activity, providing input to atomistic simulations. Accelerated simulations will reveal molecular mechanisms and calculate their kinetics, supporting the interpretation of structural and chemical transformations. Characterization and modeling tools will be applicable to a wide range of heterogeneous reactions and catalyst compositions. The broad impact of the effort will be to bring cutting edge machine learning techniques into the scientific domain of reactive chemical phenomena.

In particular, efforts will focus on understanding electronic and magnetic responses at the sub-nanometer scale that permit kinetic and/or thermodynamic access and control of magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These strategies will clarify essential lattice conditions, including atomic defects, chemical additives and composition profiles along crystallite boundaries that are the most favorable for achieving magnetic stability. Two complementary theoretical and computational approaches (Hamiltonian-type methods linking symmetry with physical phenomena and Density Functional Theory (DFT)-based Disordered Local Moment (DLM) techniques) will guide experimental protocols to achieve understanding of magnetic stability. These efforts will address the fundamental science underpinning the intrinsic properties of magnetic materials which arise from a complex glue of electrons binding the nuclei of a material together, generating magnetism and determining atomic arrangements. Tightly coupled experimental efforts will examine the thermodynamic metastability, the lattice defect structure and the associated magnetic character of two families of ferromagnetic materials featuring atomic layers within the crystal lattice.

These benchmarks will be used to evaluate model performance from simulations that align with experimental perturbations (such as soil warming). We will perform model simulations with a suite of Earth System Models at the site-level and with a smaller subset of models at the pan-Arctic scale. Model performance will be evaluated against the synthesized experimental data to assess predictive capability among land models. In addition, results from model simulations will be used to define recommended future changes in model structure and parameterization that will be necessary to represent carbon dynamics for this region.

It has been a formidable task to construct artificial crystalline organic polymers until the discovery of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in 2005. COFs represent an emerging class of crystalline porous materials that permit the integration of organic units into periodic networks. COFs feature intriguing properties such as high crystallinity, permanent porosity, lightweight character, versatile synthesis, and adjustable structures, which underpin their use in energy relevant applications such as catalysis, supercapacitors, photovoltaics, rechargeable batteries, and radionuclide sequestration. The formation of COFs usually hinges on reversible reactions which impart defect-healing to yield the most thermodynamically stable crystalline materials. Notwithstanding, the reliance upon reversible reactions limits the chemical stability and structural complexity of COFs. Therefore, moving bulk COF synthesis beyond the common reliance on reversible reactions will create novel COFs with exceptional chemical robustness and optoelectronic properties inaccessible by conventional means. The current synthesis of COFs beyond reversible reactions is mainly limited to the growth of 2D COFs at confined interfaces, whereas the facile synthesis of bulk COFs via single-step irreversible reactions remains largely underexplored. Among numerous irreversible reactions, transition-metal-mediated cross-coupling reactions are recognized as the most versatile synthetic toolkits to access robust covalent bonds. The enormous functional group tolerance, mild reaction conditions, operational simplicity, and superb efficiency underpin their broad use in the synthesis of porous materials. However, the emergent materials are mostly amorphous. The objective of this research is to translate the irreversible cross-coupling reactions into the realm of COFs through a feedback loop of directed synthesis, mechanistic investigation, and energy application, which represents a conceptual revolution that frees bulk COF synthesis from the ‘tyranny’ of reversible reactions. Specifically, self-directional monomers will be linked through cross-coupling reactions to afford as-yet-undiscovered robust COFs. To accelerate the COF formation, microwave-assisted synthesis will be applied. Further, pre-formed COF analogs will act as topology templates and seeds for the controlled synthesis of new COFs via cross-coupling reactions, which will be exploited in photocatalysis coupled with an in-depth exploration of the origins of catalytic properties. In addition to the directed synthesis, the formation mechanism of novel COFs will be unraveled by a combination of experimental and computational approaches including ex-situ kinetic studies, in-situ probes, and computational simulations. This research directly fits the Material Chemistry Program in Basic Energy Science (BES) since it will produce new COFs through mechanistic understandings and precise control of synthetic pathways."

The Center integrates experimental, theoretical, and computational efforts to collaboratively solve cutting-edge kinetic-scale physics problems in magnetized plasmas using disparate and complementary approaches. The core scientific research area for the Center is plasma physics at the kinetic-scale. Plasmas, also called ionized gases, are the “fourth state of matter” alongside solids, liquids, and gases. Plasmas can be described using a “fluid” description retaining only its bulk properties, such as density and bulk velocity, or using a “kinetic” description that retains statistical information about velocities of the particles in the system as described by their velocity distribution functions (vdfs). The kinetic description is crucial for any process in magnetized plasmas for which key dynamics occurs at or below the scale of the gyration of charged particles around the magnetic fields. The necessity for a kinetic description is common in many plasma systems, including fusion plasmas, the Sun, the solar wind, magnetospheres of Earth and other planets, and many astrophysical plasmas. The centerpiece of the Center for KINETIC Plasma Physics is the PHASMA experiment – there are currently no other laboratory experiments in the world making direct measurements of 3D velocity distribution functions of both positively charged ions and of electrons (ivdfs and evdfs) in a 3D volume at kinetic scales. For perspective, the in-situ measurement of ivdfs and evdfs in space plasmas with satellites has revolutionized space physics, providing the community an ability to study and understand kinetic-scale processes. The proposed project exploits this new facility’s unprecedented capability to provide measurements in laboratory plasmas commensurate with those obtained by satellites and builds on a strong history of plasma research across its subfields benefitting from insight garnered from “basic” plasma physics experiments. Another major strength of the work proposed here is the immediate synergy with computational and theoretical researchers on site. The team has existing computational resources using the fluid (MHD, Hall-MHD, two-fluid), kinetic (particle-in-cell), and test-particle approaches, and each treats fully 3D domains which facilitates comparison to PHASMA. The two-year project proposed here is focused on particle acceleration and plasma heating during magnetic reconnection and magnetized sheaths with applications to fusion energy, space weather, solar and space physics, planetary sciences, plasma astrophysics, and industrial plasmas. Looking beyond, PHASMA will facilitate the study of a wide range of phenomena which are planned for future study, including the above topics as well as anisotropy driven instabilities in space-relevant plasmas and spontaneous generation of ion beams in expanding plasmas. The theme of the initial two-year grant was capacity building via the development of a user facility and integration of researchers and students throughout the state. The theme for this renewal is the growth of human capital in plasma physics and the broadening of research capabilities in plasma physics in the state. The research team at WVU has expanded from three faculty in the Department of Physics and Astronomy for the first grant to six faculty, including one in the College of Engineering. The physical research infrastructure developed through the first award is playing a critical role in the recruitment and support of new early-career faculty at WVU. The growth of the WVU team expands the diversity of research areas (fundamental plasma physics, space physics, planetary sciences, data science and machine learning), technical approaches to research (experiment, theory/simulation, and satellite observation), career stage (large influx of early career faculty), and gender diversity. Participation from researchers in the state of West Virginia but outside of WVU will continue during the proposed effort. These scientists are at four-year institutions, federal research laboratories, and high schools in the state. University-wide, the Center provides a focal point for recruiting and training undergraduate and graduate students in plasma physics. Consistent with the EPSCoR program mission, a primary goal of this work is to develop the human and scientific infrastructure needed in WV for faculty to become competitive for center-level, plasma physics funding opportunities at the national level. The proposed research falls into the Discovery Plasma Science focus area of the research portfolio of the Office of Science Fusion Energy Sciences (FES). This office supports basic plasma physics research because of the importance of such research in advancing efforts in thermonuclear fusion, space weather, plasma astrophysics, and the use of plasmas in manufacturing, energy production, and medicine.

Among the readily available compounds available from plants, ethanol can be envisioned as an important building block for fuels and chemical feedstock production. However, fundamentally new approaches to chemical catalysis and/or reaction engineering are required to achieve this goal. The objectives of this research project are to rationally design new molecular catalysts that enable chemical transformations of bio-relevant chemical feedstocks including ethanol in concert with reaction engineering to control product outcomes. The research strategy targets an approach to use synthetic chemistry to 1) design metal-ligand complexes to promote hydrogen transfer catalysis reactivity of compounds that can be derived from biological feedstocks, (2) use photochemically induced molecular bond rearrangements to facilitate hydrogenation/dehydrogenation chemical reactions, and (3) develop continuous flow reaction chemistry to control reaction selectivity and/or functionalize reactive intermediates so that they can be processed for use as chemical building block synthons. These strategies are being targeted in order to overcome the limiting technical barriers and to ultimately control the chemical conversion of bio-derived feedstocks. These new approaches to study such transformations are directly relevant to DOE&rsquo;s missions, which include C-H-O activation for selective reduction and oxidation of fossil- and biomass-related conversions that can be adapted for energy generation and storage. The research efforts will impact the efficiency of conversion of matter into fuels, chemicals, and materials, while minimizing the impact on the environment. Ultimately, this project will contribute to energy independence by providing a means to use renewable feedstocks to produce transportation-grade biofuels that can displace a share of petroleum-derived fuels to reduce U.S. dependence on oil and encourage a domestic bioenergy industry."

This is important for understanding, and ultimately to predict, the unusual chemical reactivities observed in many environments such as air-water interfaces, water-hydrophobic boundaries and within nanoconfined aqueous solutions. The studies will be accomplished by using carefully assembled molecular clusters that provide well-defined objects mimicking the partial solvation of molecules. A unique aspect of our approach is the ability to probe and reveal the strength of each individual interactions within the cluster. Systematic variations can then provide insights into the interdependence between the ion-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions. The results from these studies will allow us to develop generalized molecular-based models that can be applied to condensed-phase environments of interest. The goals in this research project are aligned with three of the synergistic research themes of the Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, & Biosciences (CSGB) division that relates to the understanding of chemistry at complex interfaces, chemistry in aqueous environments, and reaction pathways in diverse environment."

Aliphatic alkenes as well as aromatic compounds are substrates for microsomal cytochrome P450 oxygenases. These compounds are oxygenated across double bonds to the corresponding epoxides. The epoxides formed serve as alkylating reagents that can covalently modify both proteins and nucleic acids and result in mutagenic effects. A novel bacterial pathway of the aerobic microorganism Xanthobacter autotrophicus strain Py2 has recently been described in which epoxides produced by alkene oxidation and ketones produced by the oxidation of alcohols are further metabolized to beta-keto acids. The discovery of the pathway was facilitated by the ability of the organism to use aliphatic alkenes, epoxides, and ketones as sole sources of carbon and energy in spite of the toxicity of these compounds. Studies of alkene and ketone metabolism have identified a central role for CO2 and, specifically, CO2 fixation reactions in these processes. The CO2 fixing enzymes of the pathways are distinct carboxylases with unique molecular properties and cofactor requirements. The main focus and aims of this proposal involve providing the structural basis for the mechanistic understanding of the reactions catalyzed by 2-ketopropyl coenzyme M oxidoreductase / carboxylase and acetone carboxylase, the terminal steps in the convergent pathways of alkene and ketone metabolism in Xanthobacter autotrophicus strain Py2. We are utilizing a multidisciplinary approach involving integrating kinetic studies, site specific amino acid substitution studies, and structural work involving x-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry in the presence of substrate analogs and mechanism base inhibitors to ascertain information concerning the biochemical mechanisms of enzyme catalyzed reactions."

Santangelo Colorado State University The energy production strategies supporting growth of hyperthermophilic Archaea push the known limits of energy conversation mechanisms and likely mimic the energy transaction strategies present in early life on Earth. Many advances in our understanding of these systems have emerged from the genetically-tractable order Thermococcales wherein the roles of individual enzymes, soluble and membrane-bound respiratory complexes, regulatory factors, and competing and complementary catabolic pathways have been probed by a combination of ever-increasingly complex genetic, biochemical, and –omics approaches. Our long-term research goal is to determine the interplay, competition and regulation of archaeal energy and redox transactions systems. Catabolism of marginal substrates may yield only ~one-tenth of the necessary energy ATP production. If reduction of even weakly energetic substrates can be coupled to formation of an electrochemical gradient, this gradient can be exploited for ATP production. Evolutionary competition has presumably favored mechanisms to conserve and combine multiple, relatively small DG gains to harness sufficient energy to drive ATP synthesis. The Thermococcales, a group of heterotrophic, anaerobic, hyperthermophilic marine archaea use a chemiosmotic mechanism involving an electrochemical ion gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane to drive ATP synthesis via an A1A0 ATP synthase. This gradient is generated via the action of a multi-subunit membrane-bound NiFe-hydrogenase (termed MBH) or a membrane-bound sulfane-reductase (MBS) which couples ferredoxin-driven reduction of protons or polysulfides (thereby generating H2 or H2S, respectively) to H+ translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. Ferredoxins (Fds) are critical to this lifestyle, given their redox potentials (E0’) are sufficiently low to not only permit reduction of protons to H2 (E0’&shy;&shy; = -414 mv), but to drive such a reaction with sufficient excess that energy is available to drive translocation of ions across the membrane. This application builds on the successes from the prior period of productive research funding that resulted in a paradigm shift regarding the roles of Fd-isoforms in directing electron flux in vivo through selective and distinct pathways. We aim to extend our findings to establish the rules dictating Fd-interactions, to rationally manipulate electron flux in vivo by altering Fd availability and interplay, and to establish the structures and redox potentials of the Fd-isoforms from T. kodakarensis. The proposed studies immediately and directly address the core programs of the BES Physical Biosciences portfolio, namely to elucidate fundamental knowledge pertaining to the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that underlie energy conversion in non-medical microbes. The proposed studies leverage existing techniques and develop new strategies to establish the roles of fundamentally important electron carriers in central energy-related transactions in hyperthermophilic Archaea. The results obtained will be more broadly applicable to the overarching missions of the DOE to establish novel platforms and pathways for next generation biofuels and bio-renewables, as well as greener-whole cell biocatalysts for conversion of renewable biomass to fermentable sugars."
Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay at Drexel,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0014517,"Dolinski, Michelle",Michelle.Dolinski@drexeluniversity,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Neutrinoless double beta decay at Drexel M. Dolinski, Drexel University (Principal Investigator) The search for neutrinoless double beta decay can help to explain the origin of matter in the universe. It is an open experimental question whether neutrinos have Majorana mass terms, and the exploration of the neutrino sector provides a direct method for probing new physics. The discovery of neutrinoless double beta decay would demonstrate lepton number violation and prove that neutrinos are Majorana fermions. The proposed nEXO experiment will search for neutrinoless double beta decay of 136Xe using 5 tonnes of enriched xenon in a single phase liquid xenon TPC, with a sensitivity of 1028 years. The group at Drexel University works on the search for neutrinoless double beta decay of 136Xe as part of the nEXO Collaboration, a next generation search that builds on the success of the EXO-200 experiment. We will address the challenge of achieving excellent energy resolution in nEXO through a focus on photon detection and calibration. The energy resolution goal for nEXO is 1%. The energy resolution in EXO-200 was limited by the light collection efficiency and energy resolution in the scintillation channel, and the improvement in nEXO will be made possible by the planned adoption of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) technology for photon detection, with a goal of greater than 3% overall light collection efficiency. Calibrating the inner volume of a large monolithic detector poses challenges for external gamma-ray sources, necessitating a new approach to detector calibration. Drexel University contributes the expertise for both characterization of SiPMs, individually and as part of an integrated photon detection system, and simulation studies of the light response of the nEXO detector. Photon detector hardware work will be carried out in close collaboration with Brookhaven National Laboratory. Complementary simulation studies will ensure that hardware design decisions and quality control requirements for the photon detection system are responsive to the physics goals of nEXO. The simulations will also support the design of a comprehensive calibration plan for nEXO, based on a successful test of dissolved radon sources carried out at the end of the EXO-200 experiment. This effort is aligned with DOE priorities for tonne-scale neutrinoless double beta decay. It also provides a valuable training ground for undergraduate and graduate students."
NITROGENASE REDUCTION OF N2 AND CO2,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0010687,"Seefeldt, Lance",Lance.Seefeldt@utahstateuniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Nitrogenase Reduction of N2 and CO2 Lance C. Seefeldt, Utah State University (Principal Investigator) Dennis R. Dean, Virginia Tech (Co-Investigator) Project Summary. This renewal application describes the continuation of a research program aimed at elucidating molecular level details of the mechanism of reduction of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to hydrocarbons (e.g., C1 to C4) catalyzed by nitrogenase. The reduction of these abundant small molecules represents the most difficult reactions catalyzed in nature. Revealing the underlying catalytic principles that biology uses to achieve such reductions under benign conditions should provide foundational knowledge for the design of sustainable biomimetic catalysts for achieving these difficult reductions at scale. Progress during the last funding period included: (i) characterizing the properties of Fe-hydrides on the nitrogenase active site FeMo-cofactor as central to the mechanism for reduction of both N2 and CO2, including use of advanced quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations; (ii) purification and comparative analyses of all three nitrogenase isozymes; (iii) demonstration that all three enzymes follow the same fundamental re/oa mechanism at the E4 state; and (iv) development of a robust kinetic model that provides quantitative determination of the relative rates of H2 formation and N2 reduction by all three nitrogenases. In the current proposal, we build on these foundations to advance full mechanisms for the reduction of these two recalcitrant molecules. The specific aims proposed are: 1. Gain molecular-level insights into how the cofactors and protein environments in the three nitrogenase isozymes contribute to N2 reduction, while disfavoring unproductive H2 formation. We propose a multi-pronged approach using a combination of amino acid substitutions, analysis of the product formation rates by altered proteins, application of a robust kinetic model to deduce rate constants for competing reactions, characterization by advanced spectroscopy methods, and application of QM/MM calculations, to build a framework of the chemical principles that control the N2 reduction reaction. 2. Reveal chemical principles that tune nitrogenase CO2 reduction product distribution between CO/hydrocarbons or formate. The product profiles for CO2 reduction for the three nitrogenase isozymes will be established. Further, the consequences of substituting select amino acid side chains in the vicinity of the active site cofactors on product distribution will be evaluated. Advanced QM/MM calculations are outlined as a way to build reaction pathways with energy levels for the CO2 reduction reactions, adding chemical principles to our understanding of factors controlling product distribution. 3. Apply recently developed rapid purification methods to all three nitrogenase forms (Mo-dependent, V-dependent, and Fe-only) to advance comparative catalytic and biophysical characterization of all three systems to accomplish goals 1 & 2 above.In the previous funding period, we implemented a Strep-tag based affinity purification approach (STAC) that permits the rapid purification of all three nitrogenase isozymes. The application of this purification procedure will permit the rapid implementation and advancement of goals 1 & 2. Potential Impacts. The studies proposed here will provide new insights into the molecular-level mechanism of N2 and CO2 reduction. Such transformations offer an approach to utilize these abundant starting compounds for the storage of renewably generated electrons/protons and in the synthesis of a vast array of important compounds. The reduction of N2 and CO2 by multiple electrons and protons is difficult, with many known catalysts having limited reaction rates or lifetimes or utilizing significant fossil energy. The studies outlined here will provide valuable insights that can be used in the design of new, sustainable catalysts."

Rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have received tremendous attention because of their wide working voltage window, high energy density, and simplified fabrication. LIBs have significant role in electric vehicles, apart from consumer electronics devices, such as mobile electronic devices, laptops, digital cameras. Additionally, LIBs are considered promising energy storage devices for electricity derived from renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind. Compared with the anode materials, the main obstacle in the LIBs is the cathode, and there is an ongoing push towards optimized LIB cathode materials with high performance and cost effectiveness. The cost of cathode material accounts for >20% of the overall cost of LIB. Cathode materials in LIBs are typically multicomponent metal oxides, such as lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium manganese oxide (LMO), and lithium-nickel-cobalt-manganese oxide (NCM)2,3,6. In particular, nickel-rich cathode materials such as Li(Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1)O2 (NCM811) have gained increased use due to their high energy density. One of the major obstacles towards generating cost-effective NCM811 cathode material is the long calcination times required to achieve the desired crystalline structure of the cathode materials. In this Phase 1 SBIR proposal, Vuronyx Technologies will collaborate with Professor Sili Deng at Massachusetts Institute of Technology to further develop ultra-fast calcination of lithium ion battery cathode material using flame-assisted spray pyrolysis synthesis (FASP). Preliminary data on NCM811 cathode material show that a modified flame-assisted spray pyrolysis method using low-cost urea as an additive can achieve calcination in merely 20 min. Moreover, since there is no need to ramp up and ramp down the heating before and after calcination, respectively, the total synthesis time of the cathode materials can be one to two orders of magnitude faster than the traditional coprecipitation-lithiation-calcination approach. In Phase 1, the technology will be further scaled-up. The performance of the cathodes will be evaluated in lithium-ion battery, and their performance compared to cathodes manufactured using traditional oven based sintering methods. Further a techno-economic analysis will be performed to understand the cost implications of the FASP, compared to traditional sintering process."

Increasing demand for batteries is a concern because there are not enough raw materials available to support this projected growth. Further, battery-grade graphite, a key component of lithium-ion batteries, is almost exclusively supplied from foreign sources. The Vehicle Technologies Office has taken special interest in technologies that focus on mitigating global supply risk by establishing work based on three foundational pieces: (1) diversifying supply chains, (2) developing material and technology substitutes, and (3) promoting recycling, reuse, and efficiency. The proposed work addresses all three of these goals by upcycling low-value recycled graphite obtained from spent lithium-ion batteries into high-capacity, high- value anode materials for use in new batteries. Though recycling of batteries is currently performed by several companies, none of their recycling methods is optimized to provide graphite that is suitable for conversion directly to electrodes, due to the high cost of removing organic and inorganic impurities. The innovation represented by the proposed work is a process to utilize impure recycled graphite to create a new high-capacity anode material. The process uses a proprietary, low-cost, inorganic, resin-based technology to create conductive ceramics. Previous work by the proponent has shown that polymer-derived ceramics, which are the result of inert gas pyrolysis of ceramic-forming polymers, can be used to encapsulate impurities and inhibit their deleterious effects on graphite performance. In Phase I, previously obtained results will be used as a foundation to develop and demonstrate a viable process for producing high-performance graphite for use in battery anodes from recycled materials obtained from multiple different sources. Electrochemical performance of the developed anode composites will be characterized, with a focus on specific capacity and first-cycle efficiency. The best-performing composite anode will be used for feasibility studies in full cells with a capacity of greater than 225 mAh. The primary benefit of this work will be the ability to use recycled graphite (designated as a critical mineral), which until now, has not been deemed economically viable due to low purity and rejuvenation cost post-recycling. The concomitant reduction in dependence on foreign sources of a critical material is of interest for national security and supply chain issues. Further, use of recycled graphite through this process promises to require less energy and simplified manufacturing scale-up compared to other approaches. Beyond Phase I, the technology can be applied to larger batteries with the eventual goal of supporting recycling and reuse of materials from and for large market consumers such as electric vehicles."

The rapid growth in electricity demand for building space conditioning poses significant problems for infrastructure and for decarbonizing the economy. Thermal-energy storage (TES) technology offers an effective and efficient pathway to reduce peak demand. However, residential and small-to-medium commercial TES integration is hampered by the lack of understanding of those systems’ costs and benefits and how to select and size them appropriately. The proposed project focuses on increasing the rate of commercialization of TES by developing a simple and flexible design and savings analysis tool to allow the comparison of a range of available and proposed TES systems in combination with heat pumps. The tool will model the load shifting capabilities of a variety of TES sizes and configurations from smaller peak shaving applications to larger deployments capable of eliminating peak period HVAC loads and providing resilience during power disruptions. OptiMiser’s nimble platform will be able to adapt and showcase the rapid evolution of TES. DOE funding will allow OptiMiser, LLC to develop an approachable software tool that provides a simple analysis of the benefits of TES integrated heating/cooling systems in residential and small-to-medium commercial buildings. The tool will be designed with a flexible input approach that can be used both as a discovery tool for building owners/operators and as a sizing and sales tool by HVAC installers without requiring deep expertise in TES technology. It will provide economic analysis allowing users to identify the best system size to balance upfront costs against long term savings from efficiency gains and load shifting that takes advantage of TOU electric rates. Low-cost, long-life, high-efficiency TES can contribute to load shifting that is critical for greater integration of renewable energy and the transition away from fossil fuels. TES can shift electrical load from peak to off-peak hours, making buildings smart grid-ready by making equipment more demand responsive. The proposed TES software will act as a consumer education tool addressing the barrier of complex TES sale selection by communicating TES value to key players. Simplified modeling will remove TES deployment barriers. The levelized cost of storage analysis produced can be used by researchers to identify cost targets required to enable successful TES technology commercialization."

The work is focused on advancing our understanding of the role of the 6d and 5f electrons in the electronic structure of these species. Computational chemistry finds these molecules to be particularly challenging, due to the high density of electronic states and the highly correlated electronic motions in the partially filled 6d and 5f subshells. In addition, relativistic effects, including spin-orbit interactions, are of great importance in the actinides. Accurate benchmark data is critically needed to assess methodological developments in this field. The major focus is the precise measurement of bond dissociation energies (BDEs) by the observation of a sharp predissociation threshold in a resonant two-photon ionization (R2PI) spectrum. The Morse group has successfully applied this technique to about 30 transition metal dimers and trimers and to over 75 transition metal-main group diatomics, with error limits generally below 0.01 eV. In this proposal, we will measure the BDEs of Th2, ThB, ThSi, ThP, ThSe, U2, UB, UC, UN, USi, UP, US, and USe, among others. We anticipate reducing the error limits on the currently accepted BDE values by factors of 10 to 100, thereby building up a compendium of precise values for testing computational models of the 5f and 6d electrons. Measurements of the BDEs of the actinide cations will be conducted in a cryo-cooled ion photodissociation spectrometer. BDEs of the more strongly bound Th+-O, Th+-N, U+-O, OU+-O, etc. molecules will be measured by the observation of a sharp predissociation threshold at the two-photon level, using a resonant two-photon dissociation (R2PD) method. Combining the BDEs of the neutral and cationic molecules with precisely known ionization energies from PFI- ZEKE work will close the thermochemical cycle, allowing tests for self-consistency. When the BDE of the neutral cannot be measured due to its high BDE and low IE (ThF, ThO, UF, and UO), the thermochemical cycle will be used to determine the neutral BDE from the three other values. The resulting wealth of highly precise data will enable in-depth probes of computational methods and basis sets, allowing effective computational methods to be identified. R2PI spectroscopy of actinide neutrals and R2PD spectroscopy of actinide cations will be used to learn about the electronic structure of these species. Rotationally resolved spectroscopy will be used to improve our understanding of electron deficient species such as the ThB, ThC, UB, and UC molecules. These are unlikely to be described by the ligand field methods that have proven to be so useful for actinide metals bonded to more electronegative ligands. We anticipate these species to be bonded by more covalent interactions, with likely 5f bonding contributions in the cases of UB and UC. The spectrum of UO2 will be investigated in the near-IR, where the density of electronic states is expected to be low enough that meaningful spectra may be obtained. Likewise, spectroscopic work on ThO2 will be pursued to investigate the extent to which this molecule resembles its TiO2 and ZrO2 congeners, for which spectra are known. The existence of empty 5f orbitals may make ThO2 electronically quite distinct. Among the cations, UB+ and UN+ will be investigated. These species are relevant to high-melting reactor substrates (uranium nitrides and borides) that are under consideration for their high heat conductivity and high melting points. In addition, vibronic and rotationally resolved studies of UO2+ and ThO2+ ions are also planned. This work will be the first to probe the electronic structure of these species experimentally."

Metabolomics is a newer and fast-emerging technology in systems biology that aims to profile small compounds within a biological system that are often end products of complex biochemical cascades. Such compounds are the link between genome, transcriptome, and proteome to the phenotype, thus metabolomics provide an important key tool for discovery of the genetic basis of metabolic variation. Despite advancements and increasing accessibility of multi-omics technologies, integration of multi-omics data in analysis pipelines remains a challenge especially in the environmental field. In addition, there are still many associated bottlenecks to overcome in metabolomics before measurements will be considered robust. The overarching objective of this proposal is to optimize the analysis of complex and heterogeneous biological and environmental datasets by developing a user-friendly, open-source metabolomics data analysis pipeline that is integrable with other multi-omics data sets. These toolkits will be written in Python language, and will incorporate well-established and community-specific software, known as packages. Users can run the software as a stand-alone toolkit or through KBase. A website with a catalog of existing software products, best practices, etc. that were described throughout the proposal will be established. The website will establish links to EMSL and JGI where the experimental data will be housed. Our large-scale multi-omics data integration approach is highly relevant to the DOE System Biology Knowledgebase (KBase) mission of achieving a predictive understanding of the role of compounds in diverse biological and environmental systems, and will allow us to improve biological and metabolic genome-based predictive models by integrating “true” metabolic evidence. It will further promote a new streamlined workflow-based approach for metabolomics and multi-omics data integration and interpretation that promotes transparent data analysis and reduce the technical expertise required to perform data import and processing."

Metal-based catalysts are essential for the cost-effective and large-scale production of polymers, textiles, pharmaceuticals, foods, fertilizers and many other crucial materials. Further improvements of the selectivity and reactivity of such catalysts remains vital to increase their effectiveness and to minimize the production of waste by-products. New and innovative approaches are required to achieve these aims, which allow for optimization of catalyst function. The specific approach taken in this program is to study industrially relevant catalysts in non-classical settings, which enables systematic and desirable changes to their properties. This is achieved by appending catalysts inside porous materials, so that the pores provide uniquely confined reaction spaces—much like a ship-in-a-bottle, but on the molecular level. In this way, the innate properties of established catalysts can be enhanced, and even repurposed to achieve new chemical transformations. The project is highly multi-disciplinary in nature. It involves the synthesis of new catalyst materials, model catalysis testing and discovery, and state-of-the-art analysis. Computational studies are also widely employed to aid in data interpretation as well as to inform future catalyst design."

Rubloff, University of Maryland (Principal Investigator) S.B.

They incorporate nonflammable solid electrolyte materials, thereby eliminating the flammable liquid electrolytes associated with fires observed in cellphone and electric vehicle batteries. By fabricating batteries using only solid materials, the key components - electrodes, electrolyte, and conductors - can be designed and fabricated to achieve both high energy density and high power using dense configuration of components with fast transport pathways for both ions and electrons. Such high performance configurations involve large areas of contact between thin layers of electrode, electrolyte and conductor materials positioned over three-dimensional (3D) micro- or nano-scale scaffolds, such as a dense collection of wires or pillars. Designing and fabricating such structures as 3D solid state batteries is a significant challenge. Our research to study and understand precision 3D battery designs and their complex electrochemical and mechanical processes will leverage advances in thin film fabrication methods, the same approach that is responsible for semiconductor chips and other technologies. Precision methods, such as atomic layer deposition, allow exquisite control over the thickness and shape of materials deposited, so that massive arrays (billions per square inch) of energy storage nanostructures can be precisely fabricated and studied. Our existing capability in precision synthesis presents a major opportunity to use similar fabrication approaches to create novel variations of 3D solid state battery designs, aimed at accessing new scientific insights about battery behavior ranging from the molecular or nanoscale to the aggregate behavior of massive assemblies of such 3D structures as configured in a functioning battery. . Pursuing this opportunity is the goal of new research in two complementary directions for electrical energy storage. First, we will exploit our thin film fabrication capability to create a set of 3D solid state battery platforms that enable new kinds of measurements and thereby reveal behavior and scientific insights that have been otherwise unavailable. Second, we will carry out extensive computational modeling and simulation of precision 3D solid state battery structures on different length scales. Combining the new experimental testbeds and measurements with guidance and analysis from modeling will enable us to use models to define experimental configurations, use experimental results to improve model parameters, and to more deeply understand how design influences behavior of these systems. Accordingly we foresee a significant impact in advancing the science of 3D solid state electrochemical energy storage, from behavior at the nanoscale interfaces involved to aggregate performance of full 3D solid state batteries. We believe the precision structures we design and fabricate may also influence how scientists regard opportunities afforded through thin film fabrication to create and utilize solid state structures in their research. We also anticipate impact on energy storage technology and manufacturing. The 3D solid state structures represent prototypes for a new generation of high performance batteries which - more importantly - come with the scientific underpinnings to support a new technology. Such thin film fabricated batteries represent a potential paradigm shift in manufacturing, in which a new battery technology takes on the methods and equipment, very different from current battery manufacturing, that have already made the semiconductor, optoelectronics, display and other related technologies the marvel they have been for fifty years."
In Situ Probing of Fast Local Photodynamics in Halide Perovskites for Energy Harvesting and Optoelectronics,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0013957,"Ginger, David",David.Ginger@universityofwashington,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","This project will develop and apply new microscopy methods that merge high-data-bandwidth scanning probe techniques with machine learning to probe the local optoelectronic response of halide perovskite semiconductors that underpins future technologies ranging from photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to sources of quantum light. The project will demonstrate an economical path to provide wavelength-agile, high-intensity, and high-temporal-bandwidth in situ excitation of the sample allowing high temporal and spatial resolution detection of local charge carrier motion. The project will accomplish this goal by integrating and synchronizing a broadband light source with an oscillating atomic force microscope tip. This approach will broadly advance the ability to probe charge carrier dynamics below the diffraction limit under optical excitation in condensed-phase systems. The targeted resolutions (< 1 µs in time and < 50 nm in space) are well-matched to key time- and length-scales in mixed-cation halide perovskites of interest in tandem-cell and LED applications, and the project will use these methods to study photocarrier dynamics as a function of both excitation wavelength and light penetration depth. The project will exploit the fast time resolution in the laser and an optical modulator to enable significant improvements in two specialized time-domain atomic force microscopy methods: intensity-modulated scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (IM-SKPM) to locally measure the carrier recombination and time-resolved electrostatic force microscopy (trEFM) to directly probe carrier dynamics. IM-SKPM, in particular, has not been well-developed on state-of-the-art perovskite materials due to the time resolution limits to conventional light sources used. As a final step, the project will combine the IM-SKPM and trEFM measurements with correlated electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). EBSD measures the local crystal structure and grain composition, and therefore the project will develop a full picture of how emerging halide perovskite materials operate. The development of the instrumentation proposed under this project will help to better understand the origins and dynamics of defects that lead to undesirable recombination losses and instability in emerging semiconductor materials. As a result, this research will not only advance scanning probe methods development and data analysis procedures, but also provide valuable inside into the control of emerging halide perovskite materials for energy applications."

Our Center comprises a team-from universities, national laboratories, and The NuMat Technologies Company-having complementary and synergistic expertise and facilities for materials synthesis and characterization, theory development, computation, and catalyst testing. The ability to test hypotheses in silico over an enormous and arbitrarily modifiable database of hypothetical catalysts, and then to synthesize and experimentally test these, is expected to lead to compelling, transferrable catalyst design rules and potentially lead to the discovery or design of new mechanisms and desirable new catalytic chemistry.

Advanced computational methods and strategies to aid interpretation of mechanisticinformation, as well as structural and spectroscopic observations to guide synthesis 2. Advanced methods to synthesize electronically and structurally defined catalytically active sites in heterogeneous catalysts with unprecedented precision 3. Methods for precisely siting active sites in mesoscale, uniform, and hierarchically structured environments that both isolate sites and provide ready access to them 4.

PSII plays a critical role in these organisms by harvesting and converting sunlight into useful forms of energy that they need in order to grow. In the energy conversion process, PSII splits water molecules into protons and oxygen. This oxygen is released into the atmosphere and becomes available for humans and other non-photosynthetic species to breathe. Due to the unique redox chemistry of its reaction mechanism, PSII is periodically damaged, disassembled and regenerated under physiological conditions. Thus, at any instant, mature and active PSII complexes coexist with partially assembled subcomplexes that serve as intermediate stages in the intricate PSII life cycle. Many such intermediate subcomplexes have not yet been identified and characterized, limiting our understanding of the PSII life cycle. At the heart of the water-splitting reaction is a cluster of four manganese (Mn) atoms that is also disassembled followed by reinsertion and assembly of a functional cluster during the life cycle of PSII. The molecular details of this critically important process also remain poorly defined. We have recently developed a CRISPRi-Cas12a based system to repress photosynthesis genes in Synechocystis 6803. We have demonstrated the use of this system in reversibly knocking out Photosystem II. During the next phase of this project, we plan to use this system to target individual PSII subunits to focus on a newly identified PSII protein complex, NRC, and a long-observed but not fully characterized complex, the CP43 pre-complex. We will also focus on the final maturation steps in PSII, which we can control by targeting CtpA, a C-terminal protease, for repression. We will use this targeted genetic manipulation system in combination with biochemical approaches to further determine the mechanism of PSII assembly and repair. Taken together, these studies are expected to yield novel insight into how PSII functions as a robust molecular machine that helps to power life on Earth."

The availability of the rare earth elements (REEs) and the platinum group elements (PGEs) are of particular concern because of the lack of adequate U.S. domestic production and, especially for PGEs, their overall low abundance in Earth’s crust. REEs and PGEs in deposits formed by rock weathering represent new potential resources for future exploitation. However, the fundamental geochemical processes that dictate the migration and enrichment of REEs and PGEs during weathering are poorly constrained. The mechanisms controlling how REEs and PGEs bind to the surfaces of mineral, become trapped inside the structures of minerals, and are mobilized from mineral surfaces and structures in weathering environments represent major areas of uncertainty. The foundational scientific knowledge required to accurately predict the formation and occurrence of deposits of REEs and PGEs formed via weathering is currently inadequate. This proposal seeks to address the major knowledge gaps identified above through a coordinated, collaborative research approach. Our overall objective is to elucidate the roles of mineral surfaces and structures in controlling the migration and enrichment of REEs and PGEs in weathering environments. To gain a better ability to predict how REEs and PGEs behave in nature, we seek to link variations in their binding to minerals and mobilization from minerals with systematic trends in their chemical properties. This project will utilized advanced X-ray techniques and high-performance computing at national user facilities operated by the U.S. Department of Energy. These tools will be integrated with laboratory experiments to support the development of models to predict the enrichment and mobility of REEs and PGEs in natural systems. The proposed research will obtain fundamental new insight into the basic chemical processes controlling the formation of rare earth and platinum group element deposits near Earth’s surface. This integrated, collaborative research activity will provide a foundational scientific basis for predicting the mobility and retention of REEs and PGEs in weathering environments that represent new potential resources of these critical elements."

In this regime of transport, electron and phonon subsystems exchange quasi-momentum resulting in ""drag"" effects. In addition, the evolution to hydrodynamic behavior where momentum-conserving electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions create drifting of both electron and phonon distributions can be investigated. The proposed studies will perform electronic structure, phonon dispersions and scattering rates calculations within the framework of density functional theory. The full range of transport behaviors will be captured by solving the coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equations. A primary task of the proposed activity will be to demonstrate the predictive ability of the theory to describe charge and thermal transport by accurately reproducing measured data of thermoelectric transport coefficients for a range of materials without use of adjustable parameters. This will be achieved through comparisons of calculated electric and thermal conductivities and Seebeck and Peltier coefficients with corresponding measured data over a wide range of temperatures. Toward this end, we will examine how well the measured breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law that occurs in pure metals at low temperatures and the strong phonon drag enhancement of Seebeck coefficients in doped semiconductors can be accurately described by the theory. Additional questions to be addressed in the proposed study are: Can high-throughput computational approaches aid in identifying materials with large phonon drag effects at room temperature? How does coupled electron-phonon hydrodynamic transport evolve in pristine crystals with temperature and carrier density? Over the past decades, theories of coupled electron-phonon transport have frequently used simple theoretical models containing ad hoc adjustable fit parameters, while ab initio studies have only recently been initiated The proposed activity will contribute to filling this knowledge gap by rigorously demonstrating the predictive capability of the developed computational approach, and by advancing the level of understanding of coupled electron-phonon transport to that already achieved in the decoupled transport regime. It will provide quantitative quantum mechanical descriptions of the interplay between electron-phonon, phonon-phonon interactions and their impact on transport over a wide temperature range. Currently unavailable predictive power will provide much needed guidance and support to ongoing and future experimental studies."

Nonetheless, it is known that a number of grand-challenge problems in nuclear physics remain theoretically intractable. These include investigations into the real-time dynamics of matter after the Big Bang, or after the collision of energetic nuclei in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. These also include studies of the properties of dense systems in nature, such as the possibility of exotic phases of matter in the interior of neutron stars. Recent technological advances in scalable quantum-computing platforms provide an exciting possibility in harnessing quantum entanglement to perform highly-parallelized computations of systems in nuclear physics with a large number of correlated degrees of freedom. The overarching goal of this project is to fill in the gap between our classical and quantum approaches to simulating nuclear phenomena from the microscopic theory, i.e., the Standard Model of particle physics at a finer level, and nuclear effective field theories at a coarser level. With a focus on the question of how to map strongly interacting field theories to a quantum-bit (qubit) description, two avenues of research will be pursued. First, novel schemes for analog simulations of simple lattice gauge theories and effective field theories of nuclei will be developed and simultaneously tested on the world&rsquo;s leading Ion Trap quantum-simulation platforms. Second, similar theories will be studied theoretically, and will be benchmarked on available digital quantum computing devices. The benefits and disadvantages of each approach will be studied and quantum-resource estimates will be provided for reaching certain levels of accuracy in obtaining properties of the systems under investigation. This research, while being only a first step toward the ultimate goal of conquering computationally challenging problems in nuclear physics, will pave the way toward leveraging quantum-computing capabilities for research in nuclear physics."

Johnson, University of Oregon The long-range goal of this proposal is to enable the synthesis new compounds predicted to be stable by the Materials Genome Initiative (and similar projects) that cannot be prepared using conventional synthesis approaches. To accomplish this goal, the reaction conditions required to direct a reacting system through the energy landscape to a targeted metastable compound, avoiding stable compounds as reaction intermediates, needs to be discovered. The proposal initially focuses on investigating the initial stages of reacting interfaces between elemental layers. The goals are to understand how interfaces evolve using a precursor consisting of a repeating sequence of thick elemental layers to increase the percent of ""interface"" in the sample. The hypothesis is that the layers will inter diffuse, forming an amorphous region at the interface that spans the entire composition range between the elements. Since different compositions will have different free energies of formation and different inter diffusion rates for the elements, the shape of the amorphous composition as a function of distance will evolve as the sample is annealed at low temperatures. The developing composition profile determines which compound nucleates first at the reacting interfaces. The developing interfacial composition profile will be examined using a combination of techniques (X-ray reflectivity (XRR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), STEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. In situ XRR data will be collected to follow the composition profile as it is annealed. A second hypothesis is that by systematically varying layer thicknesses, the ratio of layer thicknesses and the sequence of reacting layers, it will be possible to change what compound nucleates first and/or inter diffuse the elemental layers before nucleating any crystalline compound. A third hypothesis is that information gained by investigating the evolution of composition gradients in binary A|B diffusion couples as a function of layer thickness and composition will enable the design of ternary precursors that avoid the formation of binary compounds at reacting interfaces. At low temperatures, disproportionation of a ternary amorphous intermediate is limited by low diffusion rates and the formation of binary compounds should be frustrated by the presence of additional elements. The local structure and overall composition of the homogenous amorphous intermediates should control what compounds nucleate, a kinetic phenomena. We propose testing these ideas by attempting by examining the Pb-Se, Fe-Se and Pb-Fe binary systems with a goal of preparing ternary Pb-Fe-Se compounds that were predicted to be thermodynamically stable, but conventional synthesis approaches resulted in the formation of binary compounds. This general approach should be broadly applicable and may also permit the formation of compounds that are stabilized by interfaces."

Zope (co-PIs), University of Texas at El Paso George Christou (co-PI), University of Florida J. Karl Johnson, (co-PI), University of Pittsburgh Density functional theory (DFT) is the foundation of the most widely used computational modeling techniques in chemistry and materials science. DFT methods allow useful predictions of the properties of matter at the atomic scale and are computationally more efficient than alternative methods based on many-electron wave functions. Yet self-interaction errors (SIEs) are present in all DFT calculations and can skew their predictions, especially when bonds between atoms become stretched, but also for some equilibrium geometries when transition metal atoms are involved. This renewal project continues research aimed at eliminating SIEs and enabling efficient DFT calculations without self-interaction that are accurate under all circumstances. In the original project, software based on the Fermi-Löwdin orbital (FLO) self-interaction correction (SIC) method was developed and made public. FLOSIC is a computationally efficient approach to implementing the Perdew-Zunger (PZ) SIC theory. Because of its efficiency, the FLOSIC code allowed extensive testing and benchmarking of PZ-SICthat was not feasible before. Key insights from that work led to a new understanding of the “paradox of SIC”, the fact that PZ-SIC is effective when SIEs are prominent, but degrades the otherwise accurate predictions of DFT methods when they are not. Based on these insights, new alternatives to PZ-SIC were proposed and implemented in the FLOSIC code. Initial tests have yielded remarkably improved results for many properties affected by SIEs. In the renewal project, research on the alternative methods will expand, supported by continued development of the FLOSIC software. The key objective is to create a self-interaction correction that works with the most accurate DFT methods, correcting only when needed. An extension of the FLOSIC software will allow SIC calculations to be used for solids and interfaces, as well as for molecules and molecular complexes. The software will be made more user-friendly, automating technical details unfamiliar to users of other DFT software packages. Workflows that take advantage of large-scale supercomputing resources will also be developed. Finally, FLOSIC methods will be applied to technologically important problems, including studies of molecular magnets and their potential use in quantum computing, investigating routes to generating hydrogen and oxygen gases by catalytic processes based on transition metal chemistry, and converting CO2 into useful products such as methanol through catalysis in metal-organic framework materials. If fully successful, FLOSIC-based methods will replace conventional DFT methods and realize the goal of “efficient DFT calculations without self-interaction.”"

Highly energetic light pulses can drive a material to a new phase, or create excitations that are inaccessible by other means. The processes and time-scales involved in the relaxation of the system after a perturbation will be dictated by the way light couples to the different excitations, and how these excitations exchange energy and momentum. This research aims at studying models and time-dependent processes to understand light-matter interaction in strongly correlated materials and the interplay between electronic, orbital, vibrational, and spin degrees of freedom. Our plan is based on three recently introduced innovative computational approaches to study non-equilibrium spectroscopies, such as time-resolved ARPES, and core-hole spectroscopies, such as Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS). The premise is to simulate the full scattering event including all the “actors” (e.g. the scattering particles –photons, electrons, neutrons–, core orbitals, etc). The response is measured in a “detector” with time and momentum resolution, akin an actual scattering experiment. This approach not only overcomes the limitations of perturbation theory, but provides a solution to all orders (it is numerically exact!) allowing one to study higher order contributions to the spectra and other phenomena, such as multi-photon processes, the limitations of the sudden approximation, and the observation of light-dressed Floquet states. The method of choice to study these phenomena is the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG), which has had a remarkable success expanding our knowledge of correlation effects to the time domain. The tDMRG method is able to study systems with hundreds of degrees of freedom and provide an accurate description of the dynamics, both in real and momentum space. Understanding correlation effects is central to the phenomena taking place in pump-probe experiments with synchrotron light sources carried out at DOE supported facilities, and for developing optical materials for clean energy applications such as photovoltaic conversion."

Furthermore, many specialty chemicals are also based on terpenoid backbones, including polymers (e.g., rubber), solvents (e.g., limonene), and diverse small molecules (e.g., menthol). Terpenoids thus have the potential to serve as chemical feedstocks in a non-food bioeconomy based on carbon and energy capture, allocation, conversion and storage by plants, which is directly in line with the research mission of the DOE-BES program. This proposal aims to unravel the mechanistic basis for selectivity in the sophisticated enzymes, termed monoterpene synthases, that catalyze the formation of cyclic hydrocarbons as the first committed step in monoterpene biosynthesis. Such knowledge will allow us to infer the mechanistic underpinnings of how plants produce highly complex, reduced chemical scaffolds. Project Description Under current DOE-BES funding, we have investigated the enzymology, energetics and regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis to discern how plants accumulate large quantities of reduced terpenoids. As part of these efforts, we were able to unravel the determinants of stereospecificity in monoterpene synthases that form enantiomeric products. We have also begun to integrate our experimental efforts (focused on the generation and analysis of enzyme mutants) with atomistic simulations, performed with collaborator Simone Raugei at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, to begin to comprehend the roles of active site architecture and electronic structure in monoterpene synthases. The specific aims in this grant period are: 1. Integrate Advanced Computational Models and Mutant Analyses to Determine the Nature and Role of Active Site Residues in Monoterpene Synthases. 2. Test Our Ability to Predict the Functions of Putative Monoterpene Synthase Genes Present in a Newly Sequenced Genome. The overall goal of this ambitious research project is to understand the catalytic cascade of reactions that leads from a prenyl diphosphate substrate to cyclic monoterpene hydrocarbons via carbocation intermediates within the active site of MTSs. Using a collaborative multi-pronged approach, we will provide novel insights into the enzymology of monoterpene biosynthesis. These goals and outcomes directly support the DOE-BES mission on fundamental research for carbon and energy capture, allocation, conversion and storage."

Future quantum computers will be based on entangled two-state qubits (or higher), replacing the binary bits of classical computers. Theoretically they could deliver computational speeds far greater than those possible in classical computing. A challenge for any qubit physical implementation is maintaining entanglement in the presence of decoherence-inducing interactions. Spin-based systems have long been considered, since they can be relatively well isolated, which is conducive to long coherence times. Single-atom and single-molecule magnets have atoms with localized d and/or f electrons, where two-body Coulomb repulsion entangles the electrons and leads to a rich interplay among charge, lattice, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom, and sensitivity to external fields, strain, and temperature. This interplay supports rich functionalities for novel device applications. The complexity of the materials, however, presents great challenges to the best theoretical many-body methods in guiding the design of new materials. The exponential growth of the many-electron Hilbert space is the main challenge in describing the properties of these systems. The key challenges are: i) reducing the exponential scaling of direct brute force approaches, and ii) delivering high predictive accuracy for strongly correlated electron systems. The auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method, developed by the PIs, has been shown to provide highly accurate description of strongly correlated electronic systems, from molecules to solids, while maintaining better computational scaling with systems size, N [O(N3 &minus; N4)], than most quantum chemistry many-body methods. A specific objective of this proposal is to guide the design of single-atom and single-molecule magnets for applications in quantum information systems (QIS) and spintronics, by deploying AFQMC based computational methods for transition metal and f-orbital systems. To achieve this, a second objective is to further develop the state-of-start AFQMC method, adding new functionalities and efficiencies to address this challenging problem. In parallel with this, we will benchmark DFT and quantum-chemistry methodologies against highly accurate AFQMC calculations, facilitated by a collaboration with Kyungwha Park (Virginia Tech) whose group will focus on DFT methodologies that include self-interaction correction (SIC), since self-interaction error in approximate exchange correlation functionals often results in large deviations from experiment for transition metal and f-orbital systems. The new methodologies we develop will have broader impacts. These techniques are general and transferable. The capability of these tools will allow a new level of prediction and understanding of strongly correlated systems. Since AFQMC has a strong connection to quantum chemistry approaches, the new developments we propose can be integrated with quantum chemistry, as a component of the community&rsquo;s efforts to improve its capabilities for modeling and designing new materials and chemistries with predictive power. Beyond the targeted physical systems described in this proposal, these developments will broadly impact the theoretical elucidation of the physics and chemistry of diverse strongly correlated systems, with the potential to deliver breakthrough science for emerging technological applications."

However, in 2015 the U.S. produced only 3.3% of the REEs mined globally. This lack of domestic REE production necessitates importing REEs into the United States. As world demand for these metals outpaces supply, new and sustainable sources are needed, as well as more efficient methods of extraction and purification. Metal-chelating polymers exhibit potential in these applications due to their relatively low cost and high affinity for target elements. Developing materials capable of selectively adsorbing individual REEs would enable the efficient separation of these critical components from REE-containing waste streams. This research focuses on studying and ultimately controlling the interaction between polymers and REEs to improve extraction and purification processes. The approach includes measurements of metal-binding thermodynamics, specifically elucidating the connections among ligand structure, linear polymer parameters, and polymer topology in the context of metal chelation. Synthesis and characterization of a series of structurally-related polymers enables determination of precise structure–property relationships, thereby uncovering design principles for producing more effective metal-binding materials."

wetlands subject to persistent saltwater intrusion events",Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022972,"Villa, Jorge",Jorge.Villa@universityoflouisianaatlafayette,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Greenhouse gas production and fluxes in coastal wetlands are controlled by complex interacting hydrological and ecological processes whose dynamics are, in turn, modified by saltwater intrusion (SWI) events. In suburban and urban transition zones, the floodwalls and levee systems built to protect infrastructure and urban development intensify the SWI events resulting from floods during storm surges. When the flood waves travel inland, they meet these barriers, and saltwater can remain stagnant for prolonged periods, increasing the exposure of adjacent coastal wetlands to salt stress (i.e., persistent SWI events). These stress conditions induced by SWI are rarely represented in biogeochemical models, limiting our capacity to predict and assess the long-term effects of SWI on coastal greenhouse gas production and fluxes. Moreover, significant knowledge gaps exist in how the ecosystem reorganizes after SWI disturbance. Specifically, what trajectories do biological components (ecosystem structure) and greenhouse gas production and emission (ecosystem function) follow after SWI? Also, it is not clear what the relevant scales to evaluate these trajectories are. Using an ecohydrological patch approach defined by plant functional types and water levels, this early-career proposal aims to understand better how ecosystem structure and function linked to greenhouse gas fluxes in freshwater coastal wetlands affected by the built environment are influenced by SWI in the short- (days to weeks) and long- (years to decades) term. This project will evaluate carbon dioxide and methane pools and fluxes before, during, and after simulated SWI events covering a wide range of salt exposure (salinity concentration, duration, and frequency). The measurements will be conducted on a multi-setting sampling approach composed of controlled mesocosm in greenhouses and experimental wetland ecosystem units and will be complemented with time-for-space replacements in coastal wetlands with a history of persistent SWI. Data collected will be used to produce and incorporate an explicit salinity-dependent function into the methane biogeochemistry module integrated into the E3SM Land Model (ELM v1). The improved module will then be used to assess the sensitivity of methane emissions to different scenarios of SWI, accounting for increased storm magnitude and frequency expected from climate change and sea-level rise and exacerbated by current and projected build environments."

Roughly 25% of the electricity produced is used by industrial electric motors using copper wire for the coil windings. Hence, an increase in electric motor efficiency would have a massive impact to reduce energy usage, reduce industrial operating costs, while also reducing CO2 emissions related to fossil fuel plants. Electrical efficiencies, performance, and transmission are ultimately limited by the inherent conductor material properties. Thus, there has been intense research to improve metal conductor performance. Much of this work involves copper metal matrix composites using carbon nano-particles such as graphene. The most promising work to-date to improve bulk electrical properties has been with solid-phase processing of copper-graphene composites. Yet there exists a distinct lack of fundamental science to guide material synthesis and processing. This work seeks to fill this vital technological void by analytically and experimentally establishing process-structure- property relationships to produce enhanced copper-graphene electrical ultra-conductors. Development of enhanced conductivity behavior in copper-graphene composites is specifically dependent on the graphene type, quality, and content used in the composite, as well as the effects of thermo-mechanical processes on the composite nano and micro-structures. At the current state of product development, these factors are not completely understood to maximize the electrical performance needed. MetalKraft will work with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to develop and apply modeling and characterization tools to guide solid-phase processing of copper-graphene composite s with improved electrical properties. MetalKrafts’s patent pending solid-phase processing is a cost effective, scalable approach to improve electrical properties beyond any conventional conductor material. The Phase I work will involve performing a detailed process-structure-property analysis of copper- graphene composites using the conductivity modeling framework developed at PNNL. This will guide process and material design. MetalKraft will manufacture composite wire using the process conditions and graphene identified through modeling. The copper-graphene wire will be tested and characterized at PNNL’s world class imaging facilities and Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), to validate modeling and performance goals. Commercial applications include all electrical devices (i.e., industrial motors) in which improved electrical conductor performance will improve performance and efficiency, and reduce operation costs."

Most established methods rely on electrical transport. Developing an all-optical approach will enable a non-invasive and potentially ultrafast method to initiate, control, and read the spin states, which will greatly advance the spintronics and quantum information device research. Although a circularly polarized photon carries a spin of ±h, direct magnet domain manipulation with light helicity has been challenging due to the weak angular momentum transfer between photons and magnetic ions. The recently discovered atomically-thin, two-dimensional (2D) magnets offer new possibilities with their rich electric and optical properties. In particular, novel interfacial effects within such 2D magnetic heterostructures can lead to new control capabilities of magnetic states. This proposal uses optical pump-probe spectroscopy to investigate the photon-induced magnetization modulation in 2D magnetic crystals and magnetic heterostructures. The project will develop a fundamental understanding of the non-equilibrium spin dynamics in 2D systems, and aims to achieve a full spin-flip and further coherent spin control with ultrafast laser pulses. The results will provide insights into emergent phenomena between different physical systems and stimulate 2D device development for high-speed spintronics and quantum operations."

This approach not only provides an avenue for repurposing greenhouse gases, but also minimizes the necessity for harsh chemicals and hazardous byproducts common in petroleum-based processes. However, many biochemicals are not yet produced biologically due to roadblocks in the cellular biosynthesis process. These roadblocks can include toxicity of intermediates, redox imbalances, and/or loss of product to off pathway reactions. Nature uses spatial organization strategies, such as sequestration in organelles, to alleviate these issues. In bacteria, organization occurs in protein organelle-like structures known as bacterial microcompartments. This proposal has three objectives, which explore the native regulation, assembly, and function of microcompartments in the industrially relevant non-model host Clostridium autoethanogenum. Further, the proposed objectives include the sequestration of key biosynthesis enzymes from two distinct metabolic pathways to make compounds involved in rubber production to showcase the power of the strategy for reducing toxicity and product losses due to side reactions. Finally, the proposed work couples modeling with experiments to understand the native system and identify the most promising targets for compartmentalization. If successful, this work would 1) provide insight into the native function of these structures in this organism, 2) be the first direct demonstration of this feature of a bacterial microcompartment in a non-model organism, and 3) would provide a detailed method for repeating this success in other organisms and with other pathways. Ultimately, this will lead to the cost-efficient production of chemicals that are currently derived from petroleum."

Inspired by these synergistic microbial ecosystems, rationally designed synthetic microbial consortia is emerging as a new paradigm for bioprocessing and offers tremendous potential for solving some of the biggest challenges our society faces. In this project, we focus on a tripartite consortium consisting of a CO2-fixing photosynthetic specialist, a N2-fixing specialist, and a third specialist that can convert organic carbon and nitrogen generated by the first two specialists to synthesize a desired product. In addition to CO2 fixation, a noteworthy feature of this design is the elimination of the requirement for nitrogen fertilizer, which has been produced through ammonia synthesis using the Haber-Bosch process and accounts for an estimated 2% of global energy expenditure. Our overall goal is to develop a modular and flexible model system capable of producing diverse bio-molecules (varying C:N ratio) as advanced biofuel or platform chemicals, to dissect this complex ecosystem using a spectrum of cutting-edge systems approaches, and to ultimately derive scalable and broadly applicable design principles for maximizing the system performance. Specifically, by integrating complimentary expertise from multiple research labs at three institutions, we will pursue three specific objectives: i) Develop tripartite microbial consortia for carbon/nitrogen fixation and production of bio-molecules with various nitrogen/carbon ratios; ii) Investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms governing the tripartite consortia via omics study and predictive modeling; and iii) Explore alternative spatial configurations and develop scalable design principles."

Understanding and controlling these interactions is important to nearly all programs supported by DOE BER. Much of the important biology occurs at soil depths >1 mm, and optical instruments in common use are unable to image chemical and metabolic processes in the rhizosphere of these systems at these depths. Multiple scattering presents the primary difficulty of optical imaging in soils. Photons useful for imaging are those that scatter only at the object as they travel from the source, and then to the detector. For similar illumination and detection paths, the probability of a photon scattering only at the object is roughly 6% for visible light in a typical soil at 1 mm depth. The 94% of photons that undergo multiple scattering create a background that masks the signal of interest. A confocal microscope, which uses geometric gating to reject stray light, can just barely reject this level of multiply scattered light. To image structures at depths of 10 mm, where only one photon in 1012 is not multiply scattered, the microscope must reject scattered light 10 billion times more efficiently. We will produce a new optical instrument providing 3D, in planta imaging of dynamic metabolic processes with label-free chemical specificity. It will provide dynamic information through a new approach we call time-gated dynamic scattering (TGDS) and chemical information through coherent Raman imaging, with lateral and axial resolution of < 10 µm for imaging at depths < 4 mm. At depths between 4 mm and 10 mm, the instrument will offer structural imaging with lateral resolution of 0.1 to 1.5 mm, axial resolution of 10 - 1000 µm, and some chemical sensitivity. The instrument will be able to specifically identify carbon sources (sugars, organic acids) exuded by plant roots, and specifically identify nitrogen-rich compounds provided to the root by nitrogen-fixing (diazotrophic) microbes. It will be built with commercially available components, and with an eye towards simplicity so that it can be easily leveraged by DOE Bioenergy Research Centers and DOE field sites for purposes such as harnessing diazotrophs as eco-friendly biofertilizers."

In practice, however, a lack of scalable computational annotation tools means these outcomes are rarely achieved without expert manual curation that scales extremely poorly. The objective of this research is to innovate upon and scale up expert curation approaches to create a probabilistic, metabolism-centric annotation framework in the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase). Dissemination of this framework and associated new methods in KBase will make them widely available to and utilized by the scientific community. Specifically, this research will achieve the following aims, integrated within a new Annotation Collective in KBase, for robust protein function and metabolism inference. Aim 1: We will improve protein annotations using homology-based methods by developing an expanded version of the annotation software DRAM. Aim 2: We will develop new non-homology algorithms for protein annotation that supplement homology-based methods with information about shared operon structure, co-expression of transcripts and proteins, and covariance in ecosystems. As they are key to scaling non-homology methods across all public KBase data, an additional deliverable will be improved, fast read mapping approaches. Aim 3: We will develop tools to evaluate, refine, and reconcile annotations in the context of metabolic models. These tools will identify a specific subset of gene annotations that should be re-evaluated by a human expert, and identify and fill gaps in annotated metabolic networks. Aim 4: We will synthesize refined annotations generated in aims 1-3, and build an annotation layer of predicted production, reception, and expression for known exchange metabolisms. KBase users will be able to evaluate these exchange metabolisms in the context of a community-level flux balance analysis approach, thus predicting metabolic interactions that underpin ecosystem properties. The new annotation methods proposed here will immediately be applied to existing DOE research, which will serve as a model for inviting the broader research community to participate in the Annotation Collective in KBase.

Payton Gardner – University of Montana Ken Williams – Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Objectives: Mountain catchments are the headwaters for a significant proportion of global stream flow, storing and releasing water to adjacent lowland stream systems. Understanding how mountain catchments store, transmit and release water is critical for maintaining national water and food resources in the face of ever-changing climatic fluctuation. Perhaps the least understood component of mountain catchment water quality and quantity is the mountain block aquifer system. It has become increasingly clear that mountains host active groundwater systems which control the volume and chemical characteristics of water produced by the watershed stream network. However, very little is known about where, when and how much water is stored inside mountain block aquifers, largely due to the logistical and technical problems of drilling and instrumenting these systems in rugged and remote terrain. In this project, we seek to determine transferable relationships that describe the volume and chemical composition of groundwater discharge in the adjacent streams as a function of the topography, rock type and climate. In order to identify these relationships, the project objectives are to: 1) map the location, volume and chemical signature of groundwater across a range of landscape positions, rock type and climate; 2) measure the location, volume, residence time and chemical properties of water in the adjacent stream network; 3) look for statistical relationships between landscape characteristics, groundwater recharge and the volume and chemical characteristics of stream discharge. Approach: In this project, we will address a critical observational gap in the watershed science community: lack of data on variation in groundwater recharge and discharge across mountain landscapes in space and time. In collaboration with researchers from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, we will improve and extend well networks developed over the past 5 years in the Elk Creek Watershed at the Lubrecht Experimental Forest (LEF) near Missoula, Montana, as well those recently installed by the LBNL-led Watershed Function Science Focus Area (WFSFA) near Crested Butte, Colorado. Using these wells, we will measure the location and distribution of bedrock groundwater recharge and the connection between soil, saprolite and deep bedrock groundwater across a range of landscape positions, ecological settings, underlying rock types and local climate. We will pair these upland well observations with measurements of the amount, location and chemical composition of groundwater discharge to the adjacent stream. We will interpret these data using a variety of statistical and physical models to create transferable relationships that allow the volume of groundwater recharge and discharge to be estimated in other watersheds. Outcomes: This project directly addresses a fundamental knowledge gap limiting watershed science by creating new observational sites while leveraging previous investments in groundwater observation networks to create a world class collaborative network. This project will help develop the LEF into a world class observatory of subsurface connection in the critical zone. The LEF installations will be identical to those installed by the WFSFA, allowing us to extend our range of observations. With the resulting data set, we can identify emergent, fundamental, first-order patterns in landscape properties, which can be used to estimate the location, volume, and magnitude of groundwater recharge and discharge. We can also ascertain the role of subsurface reservoirs in water quantity and quality derived from mountain catchments. The impact of these studies on the future conceptual, numerical and statistical models of watershed function may be profound and long lasting. This project relies on collaboration and building strong ties between scientists at LBNL and an early career researcher at the University of Montana. In addition, the project will leverage ongoing LBNL-led work at the Watershed Function Science Focus Area to build one of the world’s premiere collaborative observation networks for subsurface watershed science, a mutual benefit to the PI and LBNL/DOE led investigations."

Ignoring these physical insights by learning models from data alone can lead to physically meaningless results. Relying on data alone typically also leads to black-box models that compute quantities of interest in physically oblivious ways and so lack scientific interpretability and give little insights into the dynamics and fundamental mechanisms of the systems of interest. The objective of this project is to develop methods for combining data with physical insights to learn models that are scientifically interpretable and physically consistent. The key is inferring model operators that describe the dynamics of the systems of interest and imposing physical laws onto the corresponding inferred models by restricting the operator inference to manifolds that mathematically formulate physical constraints. The mathematical and computational challenge is the inference of operators on these physically informed manifolds. This project will introduce efficient and scalable operator inference methods based on optimization, statistical learning, and Bayesian inference that exploit the geometries of the manifolds together with the specific setting of learning models from data. The scientific interpretability and the physical consistency of the inferred models will establish trust in model predictions and maintain the integrity of the overall scientific process when learning from data. Given the abundance of data and the lack of models in such diverse applications as climate and additive manufacturing, the proposed approach has the potential of impacting a wide range of mission-critical applications of the Department of Energy."

The Internet of Everything is emerging as a major technology that can establish a massively connected network among both human-type users and machine-type devices. Particularly, massive machine-type communication is becoming the dominant communication paradigm for numerous emerging areas, including data center networking and wireless backhaul, healthcare (e-health), manufacturing (industry 4.0), utilities, transportation (connected cars and public safety), and virtual or augmented reality for human-machine interaction applications. The rising demand for high data rates, especially in indoor scenarios and densely populated outdoor environments, will eventually overload conventional RF-based technologies. Consequently, terahertz (THz) and visible light communications (VLC) have been envisioned as promising key enablers to achieve high-speed information transmission for future 6G+ (6G and Beyond) and WiFi+ wireless systems. In particular, THz is a critical part of the overall solution thanks to its huge bandwidth to support optical-fiber-like speeds wirelessly. To achieve energy efficiency and high reliability in wireless systems, future communication networks will depend on seamless integration and operation of RF and optical systems. The best of both RF and optical worlds is needed simultaneously. Thus, there is a critical need to develop a new hybrid architecture for smart facilities (infrastructure) and environments to support the increasing throughput needs. Without such a network architecture, our ability to support the growing data demand of machine-type and human-type users will be limited, thus diminishing our productivity. Motivated by the PI’s promising preliminary results, this project follows a hybrid approach that combines THz and VLC technologies reinforced with intelligent reflective surfaces (IRS) to overcome the challenges of new generation hybrid communication links. This project aims to conduct fundamental research to design, optimize, and validate a communication-aware, energy-efficient, and reliable network (CommAwareNet) architecture for future smart facilities and environments that require unprecedented high throughput needs for massive numbers of the machine- and human-type users. The scientific and technical merit of this work lies in the research required to bring the proposed transformative CommAwareNet solution into fully functional and practical architecture. This project strongly aligns with DOE’s advanced wireless networking objectives and the ASCR Advisory Committee’s recommendations to broaden the research base and extend its national leadership in advanced computing. This research is expected to have outcomes that have far-reaching impacts ranging from a communication network, development of the computer science workforce, societal needs, and to DOE ASCR’s priorities.

While the electron spin relaxation processes inherently important for applications in quantum information science have been rationalized on the basis of the Debye model, the assumptions behind this model are incompatible with the structure of molecular materials and, thus, this approach does not yield meaningful insights or predictions for slowly relaxing, highly coherent molecules. A new approach rooted in molecular structure is therefore required to fully understand high temperature decoherence mechanisms. Our lack of current understanding further stems from a dearth of experimental studies and approaches aimed at probing the key spin-phonon coupling and chemical bonding contributions to decoherence mechanisms. To address these issues, this research employs and develops new lines of spectroscopic inquiry to quantitatively evaluate the critical spin-phonon coupling processes that control high temperature quantum coherence/decoherence in molecular systems, thus integrating advances in spectroscopy with an impactful scientific research directive. The research aims to provide firm experimental grounding for theoretical models of spin relaxation, enabling a rational path to high temperature, highly coherent molecular quantum technologies. More generally, this research ties together new experimental and theoretical approaches to study the structural and dynamic electronic properties of molecular systems, as the models developed here can be translated directly to other critical molecular processes such as intersystem crossing and single-ion magnetism. As in high temperature decoherence mechanisms, these dynamical processes are governed by the coupling between electronic spin states and ultrafast atomic motions."

Thermal Energy Storage (TES) can store off-peak/renewable-intensive for later use in heating or cooling the host building. TES brings major cost saving potential to chiller and heat pump systems, by shifting electrical loads to these lower cost periods. This project will de-risk and demonstrate a multi-mode Phase Change Material (PCM) which can be optimized in terms of capacity and transition temperature on a daily or seasonal basis. The PCM can store both cooling and heating (in the same tanks and same active material), and the tunability enables major energy (kWh) and power (kW) reductions for commercial customers. The project team will approach optimization of TES by modeling, validation testing, and case studies for integrating TES into commercial buildings, campus, and district energy systems. TES significantly enables Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings, which are essential for lowering costs, reducing carbon-intensity, and improving resiliency. The PCM testing will build upon the project team’s current product development and commercialization work, with a stretch target of $15/kWh of thermal energy storage, and an essentially unlimited (>25 year) system life for a new high performance PCM which we are developing. TES has the potential to pair with additional energy technologies such as modular heat pumps, geothermal ground loops, solar thermal systems, fuel cells, combined heat & power, and district energy systems. TES is an important enabler to full decarbonization of buildings and is safer, more efficient, more durable and thus lower lifecycle cost, than battery systems."

Compared with their silicon counterparts, the fast switching speed and low switching loss of SiC devices allows for higher switching frequency, which leads to volume reduction on passives. Moreover, with similar power rating, the footprint of the SiC power module can be much smaller than the Si modules. In addition, the high temperature operating capability of SiC devices can also increase the converter system reliability. However, over the past years, the high cost of the SiC chips and/or modules is one of the major obstacles for adoption in the solar inverters. Recently, because of the booming electric vehicle industry, prices of the low voltage SiC chips, e.g., 900V and 1200V, are dropping significantly. Cost effective SiC based traction inverters have been adopted in many vehicle models from various automakers. This creates an opportunity for next-generation power electronics components in the solar industry to be designed around low- cost SiC devices and state-of-art high frequency magnetics. In addition, combined with advanced inverter topologies, such as isolated multi-port converters and solid-state transformers (SST), high performance transformerless PV-SST, as shown in Fig. 1(a), with advanced grid features can be compelling alternatives to today’s industry standard silicon-based inverters.

Marlow, Boston University (Principal Investigator) Complex microbial communities are essential constituents of soil and sediment ecosystems: they modulate nutrient and metabolite flux in ways that filter runoff, determine greenhouse gas emissions, and support higher trophic levels. However, our ability to derive net biogeochemical fluxes from knowledge of a community’s constituents is limited by a lack of suitable methods connecting metabolic activity on a single-cell level to emergent, bulk processes. In salt marsh sediments, where redox zones are highly compressed due to substantial organic loading, this challenge is particularly pronounced: connections between dominant electron-donating (carbon) and electron-accepting (sulfur) metabolic cycles lack spatial and temporal specificity. We aim to fill these knowledge gaps in three specific ways. First, we will enhance our newly developed microscale metabolic mapping technique to identify the “hot spots” of metabolic activity in intact salt marsh sediment. The approach combines in situ incubations, substrate analog probing, resin embedding, µ-CT scanning, and correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy to map the pore network, mineral grains, all biomass, and the anabolically active subset of organisms. To link identity and catabolic function with spatial and anabolic information, we will incorporate multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization into the workflow, targeting known lineages (through 16S rRNA hybridization) and specific carbon- and sulfur-processing metabolic pathways (through mRNA hybridization). Second, by deploying the approach across daily and seasonal cycles, we will clarify the “hot moments” of particular microenvironments and metabolisms. For example, we anticipate measurable shifts from photosynthesis-derived carbon sources to chemolithotrophically-derived carbon sources as drivers of sulfate reduction during the day and night, respectively. Finally, we will optimize a metabolic model using the microscale map information as well as measurements of bulk carbon and sulfur metabolite changes over the course of the incubations. By tuning environmentally-relevant parameters to link cell-centered “bottom-up” activity with net “top-down” bulk measurements, we will advance efforts to build a scale-aware, predictive understanding of how complex environmental microbiomes shape emergent biogeochemical fluxes. We anticipate that the proposed work will generate several ecosystem-specific and interdisciplinary outcomes. At Little Sippewissett Salt Marsh, we will clarify the spatiotemporal links between the microbial community and carbon and sulfur cycling; understanding these mechanistic details of ecosystem function will allow us to better predict changes in biodiversity and emergent biogeochemical fluxes, particularly in the context of continued environmental change. More broadly, by building microscale maps of metabolic activity in the context of an intact and mineralogically diverse sediment column, fundamental principles that structure environmental microbiomes will emerge. For example, our workflow will expose relationships between a cell’s metabolic activity and its microenvironment – pore connectivity, mineral identity, and the function and distance of microbial neighbors. By incorporating these primary data into flux balance analysis – reaction transport models, we will provide a blueprint for scientists to directly link bottom-up, single cell ecophysiological measurements with top-down assessments of net fluxes for microbiomes, environments, and biogeochemical cycles of interest."

Qiu, Assistant Professor Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science Yale University New Haven, CT 06520 The absorption of light by matter follows a universal mechanism that drives crucial reactions in both natural and engineered systems. Processes ranging from photosynthesis, to photocatalysis, to energy harvesting in photovoltaic cells all begin in the same way: the absorption of light creates an exciton—a correlated electron-hole pair that carries energy rather than charge. In photovoltaics, the relaxation of an initial high energy exciton into a lower energy state and its separation into individual charge carriers dictate how much current can be generated from the absorption of sunlight. In photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, energy is transmitted by excitons with surprisingly long coherence times. In optoelectronics, excitonic interconnects have the potential to integrate the fast speeds of information carried by photons into modern semiconductor-based electronics. In quantum information and sensing, excitons allow for the optical preparation and transduction of quantum states with specific spin, polarization, energy, and momentum. Hence, a predictive understanding of exciton energies and coupling to light, as well as dynamical properties related to their decoherence, relaxation, transport and diffusion, is essential for the engineering of materials’ properties across all these fields, and more. This project aims to develop and apply a range of first-principles theories (i.e., theories built ab initio from the governing principles of quantum physics without any empirical parameters) based on the GW one-particle self-energy plus the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach for two-particle interactions within many-body perturbation theory to understand exciton dynamics in materials of interest for optoelectronics, energy harvesting and energy transport. Targeted materials include layered transition metal dichalcogenides, hybrid metal-organic halide perovskites, and topological materials.

Sara Thoi, Assistant Professor Department of Chemistry Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD 21218 Nitrogen-containing compounds are industrially important species and are commonly used in fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and polymeric resins. The Haber-Bosch process is the dominant method for converting dinitrogen gas to ammonia, which is the primary feedstock for other nitrogen-containing chemicals. However, the Haber-Bosch process is highly energy-intensive and requires both high temperature and pressures. Electrochemical synthesis is an attractive approach for ambient dinitrogen conversion. A robust electrocatalyst is typically needed to break the strong bond of dinitrogen, but fundamental understanding on factors that promote high product selectivity and conversion is limited. This research program will fill this knowledge gap by developing chemical strategies to catalyze the conversion of dinitrogen to ammonia and other related chemicals. The objectives of this program are focused on 1) tackling the poor selectivity, 2) improving the catalytic rate, and 3) generating valuable commercial chemicals such as urea and acetamide. More broadly, strategies developed from this program will facilitate the design of efficient electrocatalytic systems for the synthesis of chemical commodities and alternative fuel sources.

Conformationally-Steered Hierarchical Self-Assembly at Solid Surfaces,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020997,"Arya, Gaurav",Gaurav.Arya@dukeuniversity,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Conformationally-Steered Hierarchical Self-Assembly at Solid Surfaces Biology-inspired self-assembly can control geometry and composition at finer length scales that are largely inaccessible via top down approaches, such as lithography. To allow self-assembly to control matter at larger spatial scales, specific interactions such as base-pairing interactions may be introduced at the edges of these mesoscale structures (tiles) to allow them to programmably interconnect to form superstructures. However, connecting multiple unique tiles to form complex hierarchical structures has been prohibitively difficult. Currently, little is known how these tiles approach each other and become kinetically trapped. Nor do we have sophisticated means of regulating the pathways of self-assembly. Moreover, even if these large superstructures could be correctly formed in solution, the integration of these fragile structures to traditional circuits and devices, which often requires site-specific deposition onto a solid support, remains challenging. This project aims to systematically elucidate the roles of interfacial interactions on self-assembly of biomolecular nanostructures and tailor these interactions to steer the self-assembly pathways of complex hierarchical structures. The team will site-specifically nucleate the formation of surface-tethered biomolecular complexes on dynamic surfaces that allow them to precisely control interfacial interactions and then allow the complexes to connect to form superstructures. They will combine in situ, single molecule techniques with multiscale modeling to elucidate intermediates and self-assembly pathways. By probing and steering interactions between biomolecular complexes and those between biomolecular complexes and the solid surface, the surface will serve as the conduit that allows top-down methods to exert spatial and temporal control over mesoscale self-assembly. Hence, this approach has the potential to form higher order structures that have been inaccessible via existing approaches of self-assembly. Such hierarchical 2D materials have ramifications in applications such as energy harvesting, nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, and nanomagnetics. While this project uses DNA origami and DNA bricks superstructures as the model system, the proposed strategy to study and manage nonspecific interactions in mesoscale self-assembly may be extended to other biomaterials."

High resolution neutron/X-ray radiography imagers are critical to effectively accomplish this goal. X-ray sources needed for the task are readily available and fast neutron sources with high flux that meet the SWaP requirements are being developed. Unfortunately, detectors that are simultaneously sensitive to fast neutrons and high energy X-rays and can generate high resolution images in short time duration, do not exist. We are addressing this specific need. The proposed research directly addresses the DOE/NNSA’s mission needs with the development of a portable, high spatial resolution, combined neutron/ X-ray radiography detector. The envisioned detector would be capable of high sensitivity, high resolution, imaging of fast neutrons and high energy X-rays. The detector will employ a newly discovered, high performance, structured, solid-state sensor coupled to a large area readout to provide images in digital format. The Phase I research demonstrated feasibility of our approach through (1) sensor design and simulations, (2) fabrication of sensors and characterization studies, (3) assembling prototype detector and performing evaluations using fast neutrons and high energy X-rays, and (4) demonstrating high resolution imaging using MeV energy range neutrons and X-rays. We worked closely with the DOE program officials through periodic reviews for planning translation of this transformative technology into their application space. The goal of the Phase II is to develop a fully functional detector and conduct testing under realistic field conditions with the help from our ORNL collaborators. Specifically, we will develop protocols to manufacture large area sensors with the desired properties. This will be an iterative process involving simulations, fabrication, and characterizations. After preliminary tests at RMD, the sensors and the detector will be tested at ORNL using DD/DT generators and 7 MeV X-rays. A large area detector capable of high sensitivity, high spatial resolution for neutrons and X- rays is needed for numerous applications in homeland security, nondestructive testing, and military hardware testing and will be an ideal solution for studying magnetic structures, phase transitions, disorder, and local structure phenomena in advanced materials. Research in each of these areas will directly benefit the public by accelerating the development of new drugs, novel materials, and systems, all of which have a direct impact on health care, quality of life, addressing the nation’s future energy needs, and it will expand our technology base threats and carry out their functions across nonproliferation, counterterrorism, and emergency response mission areas."

The advantage of smaller reactors is in their faster and cheaper development. Although (RE)Ba2Cu3O7-x (REBCO) is the best performing and most mature HTS, it still suffers from two main technical challenges: protection from quench and conductor cost. Because of a much smaller normal zone propagation velocity, a normal zone in an HTS magnet generates a much larger peak electric field and thus a much higher peak temperature than in an LTS magnet. As a result, voltage-based systems are insufficient and put the magnets at risk. Additionally, voltage based detection can be compromised by electromagnetic (EM) noise. Which is an especially big problem in AC- operated fusion magnets and makes voltage based approaches completely ineffective. The current state of the art for quench detection in HTS systems is either no detection systems (unacceptable for large magnets) or voltage taps, which have been shown to be ineffective. The proposing team has been working on Rayleigh-backscattering Interrogated Optical Fibers (RIOF) for several years, and has shown numerous advantages of RIOF compared to voltage taps. Some of the advantages include immunity to electromagnetic noise, higher sensitivity to thermal and mechanical perturbation, smaller response time and higher spatial resolution (mm-range). Although the proposing team has shown that RIOF is a transformational method to solve the failure detection challenge in HTS magnets, for RIOF to be used in fusion applications, the radiation sensitivity of optical fibers needs to be studied. In response to this FOA, we propose to study the effects of ionizing radiation on a range of optical fibers that can be used as the sensing element in RIOF. Radiation fields that will be used include neutrons and gamma rays. After successfully developing experimental methods and data analysis protocols during phase I, the phase II focuses on carrying out the irradiation experiments, analyzing the results, and studying potential solutions to mitigate undesired effects. The effects of radiation will be determined via the measurement of intensity of Rayleigh backscattering, radiation induced optical attenuation, and direct sensor interrogation. These measurements will be carried out with each fiber sample at progressively higher neutron fluences and doses from gamma rays. The successful completion of the proposed work will advance RIOF quench detection technology closer to maturity for those applications that expose the magnets to ionizing radiation, while also expanding the knowledge on the use of optical fibers in radiation environments, like nuclear fission reactors."
Expanding the utility and range of quantum and polymer dots for multiplexed super resolution fluorescence imaging in plants,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020346,"Stacey, Gary",Gary.Stacey@thecuratorsoftheuniversityofmissouri,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","The emission spectra of plant pigments currently limit the number of fluorescent colors that can be imaged simultaneously and, therefore, the number of cellular components that can be imaged within a single experiment. Hence, developing fluorescent tags and a microscope system that can image beyond the visible range or Near Infrared (NIR) would greatly enhance plant imaging capabilities. Extending imaging into the NIR would support the interrogation of multiple proteins/molecules simultaneously, but would inevitably decrease spatial resolution due to the increase of the diffraction limit of light. To address this need, we propose to develop a super resolution fluorescence imaging (SRFI) platform that would allow imaging of NIR-emitting molecules, as well as quantum dots (QDs) and polymer dots (Pdots). The advantage of QDs over organic dyes is their broad absorption and narrow emission peaks, which supports multiplexed imaging with a single excitation wavelength. QDs also show higher photostability and photoblink-both required traits for single dot-based SRFI. The longest emission wavelength of commercially available semiconductor QDs is 800 nm. Advances in inorganic NIR-emitting QDs will be realized by forming stable shells around the QD cores and modifying their surface with passivating ligands to improve their oxidation stability in biological solutions. The QDs will be functionalized to support their use for antibody tagging, as well as for use in biological suspensions. To further increase availability of NIR-emitting dots, we will also develop luminescent polymer dots (Pdots), which are not available commercially. Pdots are carbon-based nanoparticles made of hydrophobic semiconducting polymers, with synthetically controlled diameters of 5-100 nm. Pdots have minimal cytotoxicity and are, thus, more suitable for biological applications than inorganic QDs. In order to advance biology and to fully demonstrate the utility of the resources developed from this project, we will undertake a challenging effort to identify and visualize plant receptors (proteins) within nanodomains on the plasma membrane (PM). These experiments will examine the dynamic nature of receptor movement and degradation at a single molecule level as a result of environmental perturbations. Practical use of bioenergy crops will require plants with high yield and tolerance to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Plants are rooted in place and, hence, have evolved mechanisms to recognize environmental threats and respond. Environmental sensing is largely localized to the PM, where a plethora of receptors and associated proteins form complex and dynamic interactions in response to specific environmental stimuli.

Beyond Shear: Improving the Prediction of Plastic Deformation Activation in HCP Materials,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0023008,"Sehitoglu, Huseyin",Huseyin.Sehitoglu@boardoftrusteesoftheuniversityofillinois,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","The goal of this research program is to improve the prediction of the onset of plastic deformation in hexagonal close-packed (hcp) materials by studying the sensitivities of slip and twin activation to the local three-dimensional (3D) stress state. The advancement of lightweight structural metals remains one of the greatest potential contributions of the materials community to a more energy-efficient future. Many lightweight structural metals with hcp structures require improvements to ductility and formability while maintaining strength. Tuning the critical activation energies associated with plastic deformation mechanisms (i.e., slip versus twinning) is a forward-looking methodology for making these improvements, but there is a fundamental gap in our ability to predict the activation of plastic deformation mechanisms in hcp materials. Slip and twinning activation is predicted using a critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) criterion that states that a specific deformation mode will initiate when its unique CRSS value is exceeded: This is known as Schmid’s law. Although Schmid’s law was originally derived for face-centered cubic (fcc) materials, today, Schmid’s law is applied for materials across all crystallographic structures. For hcp materials, reports showing a breakdown of Schmid’s law called non-Schmid behavior are prolific. In addition to microscale explanations for non-Schmid behavior (e.g., grain neighborhood effects), research has shown that the 3D anisotropic atomic configurations involved with slip in non-fcc materials can lead to sensitivities to the full 3D stress state (i.e., beyond the resolved shear stress). Because the atomic configuration between slip and twin nucleation are closely related, this implies that twinning will also be sensitive to the full 3D stress state in non-fcc materials. We hypothesize that accounting for these sensitivities can improve the prediction of slip and twinning in hcp materials and, as a result, improve the prediction of the onset of deformation in lightweight hcp metals. To test this hypothesis, we propose an integrated theoretical and experimental approach to understanding the energetics associated with plastic deformation activation that bridges eight orders of magnitude in length scale, connecting the atomic-scale origins of non-Schmid behavior to microscale crystal plasticity and macroscale yield phenomena. Slip/twin dislocation core structures will be determined with atomistic simulations and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and used to develop a modified Schmid law that includes sensitivities to the 3D stress state. This modified Schmid law will be calculated using a modified Peierls Nabarro formalism developed by Co-PI Sehitoglu that has been experimentally verified to produce realistic micro- and macroscale CRSS values and yield surfaces. The modified Schmid law will be informed and validated by microscale measurements of the local, intragranular 3D stress state and subsequent slip/twin modes in single and polycrystalline samples. These microscale measurements will be made using in-situ scanning far-field high-energy diffraction microscopy (sff-HEDM) experiments—a novel HEDM technique being developed at beamline 1-ID of the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) Advanced Photon Source (APS) by the PI in close collaboration with ANL-APS scientists. This integrated theoretical and experimental approach will bridge eight orders of magnitude in length scale and lead to the study—and disentangling—of atomic versus microscale contributions to non-Schmid behavior. The outcome includes a new framework for determining a material’s propensity to plastically deform at the microscale via its structure and energetics at the atomic scale, having far-reaching implications for predicting mechanical behavior and designing materials with targeted properties."

The magnitude of this cooling strongly depends on the cloud coverage, which in turn depends on the spatial organization of clouds into closed cell high clouds and open cell low clouds. Beyond their instantaneous radiative effects, an emerging body of work on climate feedbacks shows that closed cell stratocumulus clouds are much more sensitive to future warming than open cells and shallow cumulus. This implies that it is critical to accurately represent the physical processes that determine cloud morphology such that we can confidently assess cloud feedbacks on future climate change. The transition from closed to open cellular modes is primarily dictated by gradients in environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature (SST), which controls surface flux magnitude, and lower tropospheric stability, which impacts the ability of clouds to grow upward and interact with the overlying free troposphere. The traditional view is that buoyancy generated at the surface by a warming SST induces more vigorous updrafts, which slowly erode the stable layer capping the clouds. But the onset of precipitation, which is modulated by background aerosol loading, introduces a new physical pathway for the shift to surface-driven convection. Evaporating rain below cloud base causes local cooling which further accelerates rain-laden downdrafts. As these downdrafts near the surface, they diverge and cause gust fronts known as cold pools. Collisions of cold pools mechanically induce new updrafts that then generate new precipitation, which removes more aerosol, generating stronger precipitation and more intense cold pools, finally catalyzing the transition away from closed cell cloud organization. Recent studies have shown that a model must include some representation of aerosol removal by precipitation to simulate this physical pathway as well as a mechanism to generate cold pools. While fine-scale models can represent these complicated aerosol-precipitation-dynamics feedbacks, global circulation models cannot. Thus, despite the modeling evidence presented to date, it is unclear whether aerosol impacts on convective organization are globally important or tractable from a global modeling perspective. This project therefore proposes a set of experiments to: (1) identify the importance of aerosol-cold pool feedbacks on long-term observations of transition cases at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) site; and (2) determine the minimum complexity required to represent the relevant physical mechanisms in coarse-gridded atmospheric models using idealized simulations and realistic case studies at ENA. These experiments will lead to improved understanding of feedbacks among aerosols, clouds and convective processes as well as improved simulation of the radiative effects of organized shallow convection. The first objective will be accomplished by analyzing observations to understand the synoptic and aerosol conditions associated with low cloud transitions and observable cold pools at ENA, while the second objective will involve a set of idealized and observationally-forced large eddy simulations using a ""process denial"" approach."
Relativistically Transparent Magnetic Filaments: a short-pulse laser platform for strong-field plasma physics,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022979,"Rinderknecht, Hans",Hans.Rinderknecht@universityofrochester,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Relativistically Transparent Magnetic Filaments: a short-pulse laser platform for strong-field plasma physics Hans Rinderknecht, University of Rochester (Principal Investigator) In this research program, we investigate magnetic field generation, direct laser acceleration of electrons, and efficient gamma radiation from interactions of intense ultrafast lasers with relativistically-transparent plasma channel targets using cutting-edge experiments and simulations. When an ultra-intense laser interacts with a relativistically-transparent plasma, the ponderomotive force of the laser pulse drives a strong axial current filament, creating quasi-static azimuthal magnetic fields: a magnetic filament. The field strength is on the order of the oscillating laser field and can reach the megaTesla scale (~106 T). The solid-density walls of the microchannel act as a waveguide for the laser light, preventing the hosing instability and enabling robust, volumetric, high-intensity interaction over tens of Rayleigh lengths. The magnetic filament confines relativistic electrons in the channel, where those in phase with the laser are accelerated to hundreds of MeV and efficiently radiate MeV-scale photons by synchrotron emission. We will perform the first comprehensive numerical and experimental study to investigate the physics of magnetic filament formation, direct laser acceleration of electrons, and efficient gamma radiation as a function of the laser and plasma properties. The three primary objectives are as follows. First, we will use 2-D and 3-D PIC simulations to investigate the predicted scaling of electron acceleration and gamma radiation with laser intensity, wavelength, pulse duration, and plasma density over the range of high- to ultra-high intensity that is relevant to experiments. Computational studies will constrain the dynamics of laser depletion, and the impact of radiation reaction and novel target designs on electron dynamics. Second, using the OMEGA-EP laser at the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics and the ALEPH laser at the Colorado State University, we will measure the threshold and scaling of magnetic filament formation with laser intensity (a0 = 10-50), channel fill density (1-20x the critical plasma density), and pulse length (30-700 fs) through their electron and photon radiative signatures. Finally, we will use our results to design and perform experiments to measure the scaling of the magnetic filament phenomenon to ultra-high intensities of 5×1022 W/cm2 (a0 ~ 150) using the 3-PW ZEUS laser at the University of Michigan, where the collective dynamics of the laser-plasma interaction become sensitive to the effects of strong-field quantum electrodynamics as radiation reaction is predicted to modify electron dephasing dynamics. Intellectual Merit: This experimental program has a high potential scientific return in advancing our understanding of and control over relativistic laser-plasma interactions. The production of quasi-static magnetic fields on the order of megaTesla is predicted, approaching conditions relevant to astrophysical environments such as neutron stars and potentially providing a unique platform for high-field laboratory astrophysics experiments. Effective electron acceleration gradients are predicted to exceed traditional laser wakefield acceleration by two orders of magnitude, and conversion efficiency to MeV-scale photons is predicted to exceed 10% for experiments above 1022 W/cm2. The electron acceleration mechanism is predicted to be sensitive to strong field QED models of radiation reaction at higher intensities, opening a new regime of high-intensity collective physics. If successful, this work will also lead to a compact, ultrafast and bright laser-based gamma-ray source for novel applications in laboratory astrophysics, high-energy-density physics, photonuclear spectroscopy, strong-field QED physics, and medical applications. Broader Impacts: This proposal will: (1) improve the understanding of light-matter interactions at ultra-high intensities; (2) develop a bright, high-energy photon source that can be used for interdisciplinary research in a variety of applications; (3) provide comprehensive experimental data constraining theoretical studies in this frontier HED regime; and (4) attract and train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This work will grow high-intensity expertise within the US domestic research program, develop international collaborations and build user capabilities at the new ZEUS laser facility. The results from the research will be broadly disseminated through publications and presentations at international and national conferences and workshops, attracting students to this growing field. This work will support the Senior Personnel’s outreach efforts to diverse and under-represented high-school and undergraduate populations and promote diversity at UR and LLE.

As mesoscale convective systems move over mountainous landscapes, storm behavior, and thus the threat of these hazards, changes rapidly. Anticipating storm response to the underlying mountains remains a challenge, resulting in dangerous and unanticipated conditions for residents. In a future climate, the projected increase in the frequency of such extreme precipitation events will exacerbate the problem. This work will uncover the physical processes supporting observed storm behaviors over mountains in the present day and future climate. As mesoscale convective systems move over mountains, they experience variations in the slope of the land surface, and in environmental conditions as they move both horizontally and vertically through the troposphere following the sloping surfaces. Exposure to such heterogeneities induces a variety of storm responses, including changes in mesoscale convective system intensity (i.e., strengthening, weakening), localized regions of convective initiation displaced away from the main storm which may or may not extend the lifetime of the mature storm, and upscale growth transitions from isolated cloud populations to new organized deep convective storms. Our knowledge of the physical processes driving these different evolutions has been derived from a limited number of idealized numerical modeling studies and observational studies that rely on spatially and temporally infrequent observations. Consequently, there remain large gaps in our fundamental understanding, which hinder advancements in predictability. Further, climate models are unable to replicate these observed evolutions, in part due to their inability to represent topography and deep convection at spatial scales necessary to reproduce the most important storm-scale physical processes. This work will leverage fine-spatiotemporal-scale observations from the Department of Energy sponsored Cloud, Aerosol, and Complex Terrain Interactions (CACTI) field project, which took place in Argentina, complemented with idealized numerical modeling experiments to address these deficiencies in our knowledge. Cases of mature mesoscale convective systems traversing the Argentine Sierras de Córdoba and of storms initiating over the mountain chain will provide insight into the range of possible evolutions, environment variables that may be used as predictors for these behaviors, and the dominant storm-scale physical processes supporting each evolution type. Numerical experiments will quantify the sensitivity of storm evolution to the base-state environment, characteristics of the storm outflow (important for the maintenance of mesoscale convective systems), and complexities in mountain shape. This research will also determine the climate model grid spacings necessary to accurately reproduce the resulting precipitation patterns and regional hydrological cycle in mountainous areas."

In their current form, motor systems consume approximately 68% of electricity in the U.S. manufacturing sector. In order to obtain lightweight motors and generators with improved efficiency and performance, a highly electrically and thermally conductive, yet lightweight winding material needs to be developed. This project seeks to develop enhanced thermal conductivity carbon nanotube fibers for use as lightweight motor windings and for thermal management in battery and electronics applications. Carbon nanotubes combine high strength, and electrical and thermal conductivity with low density, making them ideal for applications where durability and light weight are high priorities. To this end, this project proposes to use a conductor made from wet-spun carbon nanotube fibers as a replacement for the heavy and mechanically weak metallic motor winding materials. The technical approach combines theoretical modeling and experimental fabrication of enhanced thermal conductivity carbon nanotube fibers. Phase I aims to develop carbon nanotube fibers with thermal conductivity exceeding 720 W/m-K at room temperature, a 15% enhancement in thermal conductivity over current state-of-the-art doped carbon nanotube conductors. To achieve this, carbon nanotube fibers will be produced from carbon nanotubes with varying aspect ratio and graphitic character. The theoretical and experimental results will guide which carbon nanotube material is most suitable for production of enhanced thermal conductivity fibers. Several different carbon nanotube fiber processing conditions will be tested to ensure that fibers with optimal carbon nanotube alignment and packing are produced with the best available carbon nanotubes. These fibers will be fabricated, doped with iodine to further enhance thermal conductivity, and tested to provide a direct comparison to previously reported state-of-the-art doped carbon nanotube fibers. The successful development of carbon nanotube conductors will be of high value to applications that require flexible and durable connectors between heat sources and heat sinks, and for use as electrically conductive wires for applications in which heat generated by electric currents needs to be quickly dispersed, including motor windings. Carbon nanotube windings could allow motors to operate at higher frequencies while minimizing potential issues related to winding material heating. This factor will greatly improve motor efficiency and reduce motor weight. Lightweight motors will be critical for the development of electrically powered aircraft and carbon nanotube winding materials will be immensely valuable for motors in all electric aviation. In addition, due to their superior corrosion resistance, carbon nanotube windings can enable the operation of electric motors and generators in harsher and more demanding environments, particularly subterranean and subsea applications. Carbon nanotube-based motors will last longer and operate more efficiently in these conditions, reducing climate impact through energy savings during operation and saving the material that would be needed for replacement parts."

This is driven by ambitious goals and programs such as DOE’s Hydrogen Earthshot which aims to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to $1-per-1-kilogram-in-1-decade (“111”) and the upcoming $8 billion ($8B) DOE investment in Regional Hydrogen Hubs. There is an urgent need to consider energy justice as a central piece of this transition, as indicated by the federal Justice40 initiative that promises to deliver at least 40 percent of the overall benefits from Federal invest- ments in climate and clean energy to disadvantaged communities. One of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the US is the industrial sector. Within the industrial sector, both the chemical and steel manufacturing show promise for using hydrogen for hard-to-decarbonize in- dustries, as well as decarbonizing electricity. Many of these industrial activities are co-located with disadvantaged communities, and so hydrogen offers a rare opportunity to deliver benefits—jobs, carbon emissions reduction, local air and environmental pollution minimization—directly to these communities. Compared to wind and solar energy, hydrogen power is relatively underdeveloped in the US. There is an immediate need for a greater understanding of how hydrogen power can benefit hard-to- decarbonize industries in terms of better environmental health outcomes, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and jobs. Our discussions with industry, government, and non-profit groups highlight the dearth of information most decision-makers have about hydrogen. Most do not know how it could be advantageous for hard-to-decarbonize industries, what parameters are most important in siting decisions, or how to talk to communities about the advantages of being early adopters of this technology. Even if we understand the political, environmental, and technical constraints in siting hydrogen, we are largely unaware of the social, health, and environmental implications that siting should consider, or of what needs communities might have that these technologies could address. We propose to develop a public participation geographic information science/systems (PPGIS) framework and software called SEEJusT (Siting Energy for Equity and a Just Transition) that directly addresses these challenges. Our goal is to develop a tool that uses best practices energy justice, with a focus on procedural justice, to give communities a greater voice in the planning process and allow them to understand and plan a more equitable distribution of resources. SEEJusT will (1) collect information directly from members of disadvantaged communities or DACs (as opposed to just mapping externally observed metrics) through its novel PPGIS approach, (2) inte- grate this with economic, pollution, and carbon intensity information from hydrogen siting, and (3) enable stakeholders—DACs, industry, government, and non-profits— to evaluate the benefits and shortcomings of individual and regional investments in hydrogen siting. SEEJusT and the proposed work is closely aligned with the DOE-EERE high-level goals described in the FOA Topics, focusing on helping develop equitable and inclusive innovative technology solutions that equitably transition America to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions… ensuring the clean energy economy benefits all Americans, especially… those historically underserved by the energy system and overburdened by pollution. The proposed work and tool also directly addresses listed outcomes, including focusing on [d]ecarbonizing energy-intensive industries and the elec- tricity sector, [m]ethods and processes for the incorporation of procedural justice, [i]ntegration of social science or multi-disciplinary approaches, [a]dvancements for economic, planning, and/or standardized business models for justice-focused outcomes., and [h]ydrogen and fuel cell technologies that innovatively maximize participation of and/or benefit to communities directly."

The technical problem that will be addressed in this application is how to develop a unique economical solution for low carbon emission sourcing of lithium from domestic resources. This application proposes to increase utilization of domestic resources of lithium from domestic resources by developing sustainable and economically efficient microbially facilitated processes for extraction from lithium-bearing clays. The use of advanced biotechnology to optimize domestic mining processes and expand to processing of other minerals is still at an early stage. This technology will utilize microbes for the extraction, upgrading and purification of lithium, ultimately commercializing a process that will increase profits for stakeholders, while minimizing negative environmental effects and allowing for domestic mining which will ultimately decrease U.S. dependence on foreign resources. The proposed Phase I effort will build off current technology and existing research. The technical objectives focus on utilizing microbial processes to reduce sulfuric acid consumption in the leaching of lithium, to upgrade the clay by removal of unwanted cations, and to lower the cutoff grade of lithium clays that are commercially viable for extraction, by lowering the costs of extraction and recovery. Secondary objectives are to develop production of saleable byproducts (e.g., metal oxides of calcium and magnesium), and explore biological mechanisms of neutralization prior to back filling of waste rock for rehabilitation of environment. The process of augmenting domestically sourced lithium supply will benefit numerous stakeholders including the public sector, commercial entities, and the federal government. With the increasing electrification of the U.S. transportation sector, growth in employment associated with electric vehicle is on a dramatic upward trajectory. Decarbonizing the transportation sector through electrification will clean up our air, help address climate change, and facilitate transition to a clean-energy economy that will benefit all communities. Stationary energy storage can benefit the electricity grid by providing many services such as enabling high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, serving remote communities, supporting transportation electrification, increasing resilience, optimizing energy production and usage, and supporting critical services like healthcare. Phase II and Phase III efforts will focus on deploying and commercializing the technology."

The durability and performance of current particle-based receivers is limited by the maximum temperature at which the materials of construction can operate before oxidation or erosion cause failureError! Bookmark not defined.. To solve these issues, USNC proposes to apply a novel manufacturing route for complex, oxidation-resistant silicon carbide composite components that will enable higher receiver material temperatures, implementation of novel designs for efficient heat transfer that are not limited by traditional manufacturing methods, and improved resistance to erosion. The objective of the project is to fabricate prototypical components, using commercial-scale production equipment at USNC’s Advanced Ceramic Manufacturing facility, to demonstrate the viability of a novel, additive manufacturing approach for manufacturing silicon carbide composite components with temperature capabilities, heat transfer properties, and erosion resistance to enable particle-based receiver designs with particle temperatures in excess of 700°C, to provide high system efficiency, and perform key testing to demonstrate heat transfer and thermomechical durability. In Phase I, process parameters to fabricate fiber-reinforced, additively manufactured printed silicon carbide components will be developed. The strength and the erosion resistance of the additively manufactured material will be measured. Test samples will be characterized in a narrow-channel particle heat transfer test rig at The Colorado School of Mines. Parameters determined from heat transfer testing will be used to produce a conceptual design for bench-scale manufacturing scaleup and testing. The primary commercial benefit will be affordable, reliable, high performance solar receivers for particle- based CSP systems capable of producing carbon-free electricity and heat at competitive costs. The work will also support development of methods for manufacturing silicon carbide composite components for aerospace and microelectronic applications. Additionally, the technology will improve efficiency of turbines and other high temperature processes."

CMCs represent a new class of engineered materials for extreme environments that hold the promise of significant increases in energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reductions. Not only are CMCs a new class of composite materials, but their application in hydrogen turbines is sure to raise new technical challenges that have, so far, not been of concern to other domains where CMCs are consid- ered. To address anticipated shortcomings with hydrogen powered gas turbines, research is needed to design, model and test alternative interphase coatings and Environmental Barrier Coatings for the intended conditions. To this end, Free Form Fibers (FFF) intends to team up with Materials Research and Design (MR&D) to implement a combined CIME-experimental approach leading to a CMC engineered for hydrogen turbines. FFF has unique capabilities to produce micro-composite samples with custom-made interphase coatings while MR&D has a proven history of mod- eling material behavior.

Novel Enzymes and Synthetic Metabolic Pathways for Complete Degradation and Upcycling of Recalcitrant Polyamides,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022077,"Zanghellini, Alexandre",Alexandre.Zanghellini@arzedacorp.,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","As of 2015, a total of 6.3 billion tons of plastic waste had been generated globally. It is estimated that only 9% of this total had been recycled, while 12% had been incinerated to recover energy values, and the remainder entered landfills or the natural environment, such as the now infamous non-biodegradable plastic islands accumulating in the oceans. New technologies are needed to address this ever-growing problem. While chemical and biological methods for closed-loop recycling, back to pristine plastic precursors, offer new potential routes for dealing with plastic waste, competition with cheap, fossil fuel-derived precursors is likely to inhibit progress on this front for the foreseeable future. An alternative approach, harnessing the power of biology to not just depolymerize plastics back to their monomer precursors, but convert them into higher-value products offers stronger economic incentives and in turn would be expected to drive more rapid and widespread adoption. Here we propose to combine computational protein design and synthetic biology to address the problem of biodegradation and upcycling of nylon 6 and nylon 66. Although natural enzymes have been shown to be able to degrade amorphous portions of polyamides such as nylon 6 and nylon 66, complete enzymatic degradation, including the crystalline, or recalcitrant, portion of nylon waste has not been demonstrated. This is likely due to the inability of hydrolase enzymes to have active sites “open” enough to bind the crystalline portion of the polymer. Here we propose to computationally design hydrolase enzymes to alleviate this limitation by introducing polyamide hydrolysis activity in scaffolds with open active sites. In addition, we will also design these scaffolds for thermostability and high expression, and attempt fusions with redesigned crystal binding domains. In parallel, we will be screening and engineering bacterial strains able to metabolize nylon 6 and nylon 66 degradation byproducts (adipate, hexamethylenediamine and 6-aminohexanoate) directly into central metabolism. Once this is achieved, such platform strains can be used to produce a wide variety of fermentation products from central metabolites. Integration of our designer nylon 6 and nylon 66 depolymerizing enzymes into these engineered hosts will provide a novel, elegant and cost-effective consolidated fermentation process for nylon upcycling to higher-value sustainable materials."
Conformationally-Steered Hierarchical Self-Assembly at Solid Surfaces,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020996,"Ke, Yonggang",Yonggang.Ke@emoryuniversity,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Biology-inspired self-assembly can control geometry and composition at finer length scales that are largely inaccessible via top down approaches, such as lithography. To allow self-assembly to control matter at larger spatial scales, specific interactions such as base-pairing interactions may be introduced at the edges of these mesoscale structures (tiles) to allow them to programmably interconnect to form superstructures. However, connecting multiple unique tiles to form complex hierarchical structures has been prohibitively difficult. Currently, little is known how these tiles approach each other and become kinetically trapped. Nor do we have sophisticated means of regulating the pathways of self-assembly. Moreover, even if these large superstructures could be correctly formed in solution, the integration of these fragile structures to traditional circuits and devices, which often requires site-specific deposition onto a solid support, remains challenging. This project aims to systematically elucidate the roles of interfacial interactions on self-assembly of biomolecular nanostructures and tailor these interactions to steer the self-assembly pathways of complex hierarchical structures. The team will site-specifically nucleate the formation of surface-tethered biomolecular complexes on dynamic surfaces that allow them to precisely control interfacial interactions and then allow the complexes to connect to form superstructures. They will combine in situ, single molecule techniques with multiscale modeling to elucidate intermediates and self-assembly pathways. By probing and steering interactions between biomolecular complexes and those between biomolecular complexes and the solid surface, the surface will serve as the conduit that allows top-down methods to exert spatial and temporal control over mesoscale self-assembly. Hence, this approach has the potential to form higher order structures that have been inaccessible via existing approaches of self-assembly. Such hierarchical 2D materials have ramifications in applications such as energy harvesting, nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, and nanomagnetics. While this project uses DNA origami and DNA bricks superstructures as the model system, the proposed strategy to study and manage nonspecific interactions in mesoscale self-assembly may be extended to other biomaterials."

Understanding mass transport when the network mesh size is comparable to or smaller than the penetrant size, and how it can be facilitated in a selective manner by bond exchange and strong penetrant-crosslink ionic associations, are key aims. Applied mechanical deformation will be explored as a new approach to control transport based on manipulation of the dynamic bond lifetime, multi-scale polymer relaxation, and network mesh shape anisotropy. The overarching hypothesis is that by exploiting dense and precise networks, dynamic bonds, deformation and specific interactions, large differences in molecular and ion diffusivity can be realized for species with little difference in chemical structure, resulting in new paradigms for achieving highly selective transport.

One major source of modeling challenges involves efficient multi-scale representation and information transfer between models at atomistic, microstructural and structural length-scales. These difficulties are compounded by the high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, and myriad uncertainties that arise in determining the appropriate form and parameter values for the sub-models. The proposed research develops active learning and so-called dimension hyper-reduction methods to enable uncertainty quantification for these complex systems. This advanced modeling approach is likely to be more realistic and computationally manageable than conventional methods. Research developments will also lead to advanced software solutions such as the UQpy open-source Python toolbox for large-scale uncertainty quantification in multiscale stochastic systems.

Fundamental investigation of grain boundary dislocation mechanisms in ultrafine grained metallic films,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0018960,"Pierron, Olivier",Olivier.Pierron@georgiatechresearchcorporation,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","The overarching goal of this proposal is to acquire a fundamental understanding of grain boundary (GB) mediated mechanisms active in ultrafine grained (ufg) metallic films, and the extent to which they dictate plastic flow kinetics. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that the following factors determine which of several active mechanisms involving GBs, dislocations, and their interactions, govern plastic flow: texture (especially the presence of tilt GBs vs mixed GBs), grain size (d) (affecting local stress and yield strength) and film-thickness-to-grain-size ratio (t/d) (dictating the amount of constraint from neighboring grains and the importance of surface effects). Our results from the first three years of this project highlight significant differences in measured true activation volumes (~5 vs 12 b^3) and concurrent TEM observations (for example, GB sliding vs GB migration) for Au and Al thin films with different textures ( vs random), initial grain size distribution (average grain size 150 vs 60 nm), and film-thickness-to-grain-size ratio (~0.6 vs 3). We postulate that each of these three factors affects the governing plastic deformation mechanisms and plastic flow kinetics, and that our integrated approach can quantify their separate effects. Our approach to study this hypothesis consists of a synergistic integration of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) deformation experiments, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based nanomechanical testing, and transition state theory based atomistic modeling, in order to provide a direct linkage between GB-mediated dislocation processes and their deformation kinetics. The objectives of the work are to: 1. Simultaneously identify the governing deformation mechanisms, obtain key details (such as character of the GBs where dislocation processes are observed, characteristics of meso-scale microstructure where GB and triple junction migration occurs), and measure the associated activation volume V * and strain rate sensitivity m in ultrafine grained Au and Al thin films with different textures ({111} vs random), grain size (average from 300 nm) and t/d ratios (from ~1 to 5), using our established quantitative in situ TEM, MEMS-based nanomechanical testing technique. 2. Investigate how the activation of the observed GB mediated dislocation mechanisms vary as a function of representative, experimentally observed GB characters and local stress using the novel atomistic free-end nudged elastic band (NEB) method that overcomes the timescale limitation of molecular dynamics simulation. 3. Elucidate the role of GB characters, grain size, and film thickness in GB mediated processes and their deformation kinetics using our integrated experimental and modeling approach. The research team is well poised to achieve these objectives by combining expertise in nanomechanical testing (PI Pierron), TEM characterization (co-PI Kacher), and atomistic modeling (co-PI Zhu). A key component of this integrated approach lies in its ability to perform quantitative in situ TEM tensile tests on thin film microspecimens that contain a small number of grains undergoing plastic deformation, thereby allowing simultaneous identification of the active dislocation mechanisms (their nature and the associated grain size / GB character / dislocation character) and calculation of the true activation volume of the microspecimen. This unique, detailed experimental characterization of unit controlling processes can be directly compared to atomistic simulations, providing both a validation of the simulations and atomic-scale insight into the dominant dislocation processes. Our integrated approach will be employed to obtain a fundamental quantitative understanding of the GB mediated deformation mechanisms active during deformation of ufg thin films, including the energetics, prevalence, and criteria dictating their behavior, and how this varies as a function of GB type, grain size, and film thickness. The comparison study between ufg Au and Al films will allow us understand the possible impact on the controlling GB mediated mechanisms due to different stacking fault energies, elastic constants, and flow stresses in two representative face-centered cubic materials. The integrated in situ experimental and atomistic modeling approach is generally applicable to study GB mediated mechanisms in other types of metals and alloys in the future."

The benefits of advanced networking have far reaching implications including improved manufacturing efficiency broadly (with more informed processes) as well as enabling less intensive use of daily resources by, for example, enabling telecommuting. The proposed effort combines high performance compound semiconductors with silicon-scale manufacturing to realize a “beyond Moore’s Law” capability for heterogeneous integration. This combination of technologies is critical and timely. Compound semiconductor device technologies including Indium Phosphide, Gallium Arsenide, and Gallium Nitride offer tremendous potential for higher energy efficiency and output power at millimeter-wave bands that exceed the capability of conventional silicon processes. In particular, Indium Phosphide heterojunction bipolar transistors are the fastest semiconductor transistors that have been demonstrated but remain niche to a few millimeter-wave applications due to the inability to scale to an 8” manufacturing process. Conversely, Silicon technology has scaled to 12” manufacturing and achieves low cost for high volume markets but has fundamental performance limits. Each of these foundry models is also segregated by their specific markets. This proposal describes an approach that will add flexibility to millimeter-wave integrated circuit manufacturing that can be realized at a fraction of the direct investment than would be needed for conventional process evolution and with the ability to deliver circuits into the terahertz frequency regime. The central heterogeneous integration innovation is a pseudolithic integrated circuit built from compound semiconductor transistors integrated onto a silicon interposer. Therefore, the chip comprises various transistor chiplets that need not be from a single device technology. Furthermore, the interposer offers a low-cost alternative for integration of digital components in close proximity with analog components. The approach can tap into the available compound semiconductor facilities based in the domestic semiconductor industry and build heterogeneous solutions within a US-centric manufacturing model. Phase I will integrate an Indium Phosphide transistor into silicon and demonstrate that ultra-high frequency performance is retained up to frequencies as high as 500 GHz, exceeding the capability of current SiGe foundries. Under Phase I, the company will investigate scaling an integration process including choice of dielectric materials to preserve the high-frequency performance of transistors and the yield and performance impact of the heterogeneous integration as measured by maximum operating frequency. By collecting the statistics on the yield of the process, the cost model of heterogeneous integration will be established to identify the future millimeter-wave applications that can be addressed by this technology. Successful selection for a Phase II award would address a design for manufacturability study through a multi-transistor analog integrated circuit including millimeter-wave power amplifiers to accelerate manufacturing of solutions for base station communications enabling market penetration by 2028. Beyond the communications market, the heterogeneous integration capability will broadly address and grow the millimeter-wave market well beyond its anticipated $25B market by the end of the decade."

In addition, the U.S. has nearly 3,000,000 acres of reclaimed strip mine lands of limited agricultural value due to poor soil quality, and over 3,000,000 orphaned hard rock mines which can be a source of acid mine drainage, heavy metal, and cyanide contamination. The sites are often overrun by invasive plant species and frequently bordered by poorly managed forests. The production and application of biochar can be an approach to solve these problems by (1) improving soil characteristics, (2) improving soil water retention, (3) reducing bioavailability and mobility of organic and inorganic contaminants, and (4) utilizing invasive scrub species. Biochar can also be employed as a method for fixing atmospheric carbon in the soil. Furthermore, biochar production technology can help the local underserved community by realizing the community’s needs in technology development, addressing the availability of productive agricultural land, and providing economic opportunities. In Phase 1, a feasibility study of a low-cost, mobile, modular, continuous biochar production process, using a rotary kiln reactor will be performed. Lab-scale rotary reactor testing will be conducted to produce biochar from invasive scrub species in Appalachian Region under a range of operating conditions including heating rates and peak temperatures to identify appropriate biochar production conditions. The biochar samples will be characterized to determine surface morphology, surface area, porosity, and cation exchange capacity for soil amendment evaluations and preliminary soil testing will also be performed. Process and multi-phase three- dimensional computational fluid dynamic modeling analyses will be performed to guide the determination of the test condition matrix, validate the modeling approach, and finally, perform a preliminary evaluation of full-scale concept implementation. Phase I will conclude with preliminary economic and marketing evaluations. After the feasibility study is completed, the mobile and continuous biochar production system will be scaled-up for pilot-scale testing and full-scale demonstration in Phases II and III. A long- term soil testing demonstration will also be performed. This cost-effective and systematic biochar production system will be transportable to where resources are located such as remote farmland, power plants, or industrial furnaces, and modular for easy capacity increase."
Energy and Carbon Optimized Conversion of Lignocellulose to Biobased Chemicals by Extreme Thermophiles,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022192,"Adams, Michael","Michael.Adams@theuniversityofgeorgiaresearchfoundation,inc.","['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","We propose to use systems biology-guided approaches to develop non-model, microbial metabolic engineering platforms based on the most thermophilic lignocellulose-degrading organism known, Caldicellulosiruptor bescii (Cbes), which grows optimally at 78°C, and the most thermophilic fermentative organism known, Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfur), which grows optimally at 100°C. This work leverages recent breakthrough advances in the development of molecular genetic tools for these organisms, complemented by a deep understanding of their metabolism and physiology gained over the past decade of study in the PIs’ laboratories. We will apply the latest metabolic reconstruction and modeling approaches to optimize biomass conversion to industrially-relevant chemicals, using switchgrass and poplar as the model plants. The over-arching goal is to demonstrate that non-model microorganisms, specifically extreme thermophiles, can be strategic metabolic engineering platforms for industrial biotechnology. Bio-processing above 70°C can have important advantages over near-ambient operations. Highly genetically modified microorganisms usually have a fitness disadvantage and can be easily overtaken in culture when contaminating microbes are present. The high growth temperature of extreme thermophiles precludes growth or survival of virtually any contaminating organism or phage. This reduces operating costs associated with reactor sterilization and maintaining a sterile facility. In addition, at industrial scales, heat production from microbial metabolic activity vastly outweighs heat loss through bioreactor walls such that cooling is required. Extreme thermophiles have the advantage that non-refrigerated cooling water can be used if needed, and heating requirements can be met with low-grade steam typically in excess capacity on plant sites. In this project, we will engineer Cbes and Pfur to produce several key industrial chemicals and enhance their production using CO2 supplementation as an additional carbon source and with H2 gas supplementation as an additional energy source. In addition, we will use the CO2 and H2 that are produced as waste products from one biomass to bioproduct conversion to supplement and drive biomass conversion to second bioproduct. We will also exploit what we now know about how Cbes degrades plant biomass to engineer Pfur to have this ability. All of the engineering strategies will be based upon metabolic and regulatory models of biomass degradation and carbon and electron flow to the desired industrial chemical products. We have assembled a highly interdisciplinary team that brings together all of the expertise needed for the successful completion of this project."

The large spin–orbit coupling endowed by the heavy elements such as Pb also leads to great potentials for future spintronic applications. Their highly programmable structures make them great candidates for constructing heterostructures to control the dynamics and transport of both the charge and spin degrees of freedom. However, the current synthesis and characterization methods both lack the necessary precision for controlling the interfaces and interactions, hindering the realization of a “materials-by-design” approach for heterostructures based on 2D halide perovskites. To bridge this research gap, this project aims to rationally design atomically precise halide perovskite epitaxial heterostructures as a material platform for long-range exciton and spin transport. Key objectives of this project are to 1) design lateral epitaxial heterostructures to direct the exciton flow; 2) exploiting interlayer excitons in vertical heterostructures to enhance exciton lifetime and transport; 3) enhance spin transport and suppress relaxation by balancing Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling in heterostructures. The active feedback between materials synthesis and ultrafast microscopy measurements will elucidate structure-property relationship in carrier recombination, exciton transport, and spin dynamics. The new hybridized strategies to synthesize functional materials can add significant value to the broad materials chemistry community. Finally, the development of new ultrafast microscopy methods could lead to new tools for characterizing hybrid materials and interfaces in general."

Unfortunately, writing parallel programs under a hybrid model (if not harder) is as hard as writing shared-memory or message-passing concurrent programs, which have been plagued by concurrency-related bugs such as race conditions. Race conditions are notoriously difficult to detect and debug because they are nondeterministic, often leading to unrepeatable computing results, unexpected program failures, hangs, crashes, or data corruptions. Despite intensive R/R&D efforts in both academia and industry, existing techniques and tools for detecting and debugging race conditions such as ThreadSanitizer, TotalView, Intel Inspector and CIVL remain inadequate, because they incur prohibitive runtime perturbation, miss real errors, generate many false alarms, lack diagnostic information, or do not scale to large HPC applications. In particular, most existing approaches are designed for late phases of software development, e.g., testing or production. As a result, it is often too late to find a race condition bug or it becomes too expensive to fix the bug. Moreover, scaling these approaches to large codebases is difficult without sacrificing detection coverage or accuracy. The overall objective of the combined Phase I and Phase II projects is to develop a fast, precise and scalable race detector for extreme-scale computing applications written under a hybrid model of MPI, threads and OpenMP constructs. It is expected that the developed system will automatically detect race conditions in HPC C/C++/Fortran programs containing over a million lines of code with very fast speed and high precision. The key technology behind our innovation is a new compiler-based program analysis abstraction called di.fferential concurrency analysis (DCA) that judiciously combines three change-centric analyses —pointer alias analysis, array index analysis, and happens-before analysis— to reduce the average computational complexity of analyzing a parallel program to proportional to the size of the code changes (instead of the entire codebase). The technology has the potential to detect all concurrency-related bugs in large-scale complex programs continuously and immediately after they are introduced in an IDE, by a code commit, or by a pull request. For concurrency errors that are undecidable statically, the technology will insert minimal runtime checks to validate them precisely, by a novel combination of static and dynamic analyses to create, validate, replay, and explain the errors, and to prune away false positives. The technical details of DCA, authored by the PI and other key personnel of Coderrect Inc., have been published as full research papers in top ACM venues (PLDI’18 and TOPLAS’19), as well as a HPC correctness workshop (Correctness’18). In Phase I, Coderrect Inc. has successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility of this project through developing a core analysis engine and evaluating on a variety of ECP Proxy applications. In Phase II, the goal is to turn the core engine into a full-fledged product that can create value for our potential customers. This technology once commercialized can have significant impact in improving correctness, reliability and developer productivity of HPC software applications written in C/C++/Fortran with MPI/Pthreads/OpenMP. It is expected that in the long term this project will drastically improve the reliability and productivity of extreme-scale parallel programming and enable more widespread adoption of in situ analysis tools to detect defects in parallel programs. It will also significantly reduce the cost of software maintenance, in-house testing, failure diagnosis and debugging of scientific applications."
Future of Low-Energy Neutrinos:  Project 8 and Solar Neutrino R&D,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0020433,"Monreal, Benjamin",Benjamin.Monreal@casewesternreserveuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","The neutrino is a fundamental particle whose mass remains unknown; after decades of neutrino detection experiments we have evidence that the mass is very small but not zero. In principle, very precise measurements of radioactive decay electrons, particularly the beta decay of tritium, should show evidence of the value of this interesting mass. A recently-demonstrated technique, cyclotron radiation electron spectroscopy (CRES) may offer a breakthrough approach to tritium electron measurements. CRES detects radioactive decay events by detecting the faint radio signals emitted by high-energy electrons spiralling in a magnetic field. This grant will support Case Western Reserve's participation in the Project 8 collaboration, a group doing research and development on tritium electron detection with CRES. We are in the process of developing our next generation tritium experiment to learn how the CRES technique applies to the large volumes suitable for a high-precision neutrino mass search. The Project 8 collaboration, in recent years, built a small device which could capture, using a magnetic trap, the electrons emitted by the decay of a krypton isotope 83mKr. By observing the krypton decay electrons, we were able to refine the basic spectroscopic methods and map out the behavior of the trap. We have been able to operate this well-understood trap with tritium (T2), which emits electrons covering a continuous broad range of energies, to demonstrate the use of CRES for actual spectral analysis, and to test our ability to understand CRES's efficiency---how many electrons, though present in the trap, are missed---and how it depends on electron energy. Case Western will continue being involved in the analysis of this data. In the coming year, we will finish the tritium operations and data analysis in the test trap and will move on to construction of ""Phase 3"". In Phase 3, the volume in which the decays take place will be notable larger than before, requiring new approaches to collecting the faint radio signals and analyzing them. In particular, we previously were able to collect all of the available radio power in a single antenna; Phase 3 will see power shared among several antennae, requiring new software methods for identifying the real electrons and ignoring/rejecting background noise. Case Western faculty and students will work on designing Phase 3's hardware, electronics, and software, in designing and testing its new data-analysis methods, and in operating test experiments."

This paradigm will however reach its limits within the next decade. Looking forward, fundamentally new operation mechanisms and architectures are necessary for the next generation of devices that can handle complex problems that are beyond the semiconductor electronics. While quantum computing and quantum information have been long recognized as the emerging technologies that promise such advance, there has been a lack of suitable material platforms for scalable realization. This proposal continues to exploit an advance in heterostructure synthesis to electronically expose the collective spin excitations in geometrically frustrated quantum magnets. Geometrically frustrated quantum magnets have been extensively studied due to their unusual magnetic ground states that are beyond the standard paradigm of symmetry-breaking long-range orders. The associated elementary excitations are highly enigmatic and often quantum mechanically entangled. While these properties could afford new computational mechanisms based on emergent quantum phenomena, it is highly challenging to integrate geometrically frustrated quantum magnets with electrical circuits since they are usually good insulators. The present study will establish a new interfacial approach for metallizing quantum magnets and electrically taming spin entanglements. The project involves a systematic electrical and thermal transport study under magnetic field on a series of prototypical heterojunctions where spin liquid and topological magnetic insulator compounds are interfaced with a correlated metal. The goal of the proposed work is to understand the interfacial effects that enable charge responses to exotic magnetic excitations. The results are expected to present a major step towards functionalizing insulating quantum magnets in integrated electronic technologies."
Synthesizing Functionality in Excitonic Systems Using DNA Origami,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019998,"Schlau-Cohen, Gabriela",Gabriela.Schlau-Cohen@massachusettsinstituteoftechnology,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","The goal of this research is to establish a class of materials that enable programmable excited-state dynamics. The functional breadth of electronic excited states, i.e., excitons, is remarkably rich. For example, chlorophyll can function in multiple ways, performing nanoscale energy transfer, facilitating charge separation, and undergoing rapid non-radiative decay. Natural systems select amongst these functions via precise positioning of chlorophyll within protein scaffolds. This position-dependent functionality can be achieved using DNA as a scaffold for dyes. The structural variety and geometric precision afforded by complex DNA architectures provides the groundwork for the development of synthetic excitonic systems with broad and tunable functionalities that mimic or potentially exceed those found in biology. Advances in the complexity and precision of these structures will enable the study of fundamental functions in exciton dynamics, such as charge separation, singlet fission, and non-radiative decay. Our interdisciplinary team spans synthesis, spectroscopy, and simulation. Theory and simulation will guide excitonic and scaffold design. Designed circuits will be fabricated using bottom-up self-assembly of DNA scaffolds with covalently positioned dye molecules, and subsequently characterized using single-molecule and ultrafast spectroscopies. Throughout, we will leverage our expertise in condensed phase dynamics of biological and materials systems to create a robust platform for programmable exciton dynamics. The major outcome of the research project is a design and synthesis platform for DNA-scaffolded excitonic circuitry, with broad applications to sensing, computation, and light harvesting. The infrastructure for nanoscale machinery is still in its infancy, despite enormous technological potential for control over energetics, chemical reactions, and even material properties. While DNA has the power to enable unique and complex nanoscale functionality, little is currently known about the limits of DNA-based excitonic circuits. Our approach takes critical steps towards advancing this promising approach for rational programming of nanoscale excitonic circuitry."

Integration of camelina could also improve the region’s cereal-based cropping systems and boost rural economies. This interdisciplinary systems biology project addresses two critical challenges in camelina biology that hinder its great potential: 1) Enhancing nitrogen utilization efficiency for economic profitability and reducing the negative environmental impact associated with nitrogen fertilization; and 2) Boosting oil yield for its productivity and competitiveness with other major oilseed crops such as canola. This research is based on the general hypothesis, supported by previous studies in camelina and related species, that natural genetic diversity exists in camelina for its ability to absorb, translocate and assimilate nitrogen, and for its capability of recruiting beneficial rhizo-microbes to improve nitrogen acquisition from the soil. Further, it is hypothesized that the genetic diversity can be explained by variations in genome structure (polymorphic alleles) and gene expression (transcriptomes and epigenomes); and that enhanced nitrogen utilization efficiency promotes seed growth and oil biosynthesis resulting in increased seed size and oil yield. Modern genomics and biochemical approaches will be applied to decipher the genetic and physiological mechanisms that determine nitrogen use efficiency and oilseed yield during the most critical processes of the camelina life cycle: 1) how camelina, in partnership with soil microbes, maximizes its ability to absorb and assimilate nitrogen into vegetative biomass; and 2) upon the transition to reproductive growth, how nitrogen is efficiently remobilized from senescing tissues into sinks to optimize yield potential by increasing seed size and enhancing oil synthesis. This highly integrative project will provide a systems-level understanding of fundamental mechanisms in camelina that regulate nitrogen uptake, assimilation, remobilization, and seed development and oil accumulation. This knowledge is necessary for the development of next-generation high-oil-yielding camelina varieties with minimum nitrogen fertilization for sustainable bioenergy production. Besides the direct outcome of several natural and engineered camelina lines with advanced traits such as large seed and high oil content, results from this research will fill knowledge gaps in many key areas of plant development, physiology and plant-microbe interactions. The basic science advancement will benefit the development of other related brassica oilseed species for sustainable production. In addition, this project will provide training opportunities for young scientists including graduate students and postdocs in genomics, biochemistry and biotechnology."

Deconvoluted photopeak with energy resolution up to 8% for 662 keV gamma has been obtained in small-size samples. The synthesis will be adapted to incorporate a wide range of different high-Z oxide and fluoride nanoparticles, as well as quantum dots, to further improve the light yield and effective Z. The composition and synthetic chemical of the polymer matrix will also be investigated to enhance the light yield and scalability at low cost (expected to be 1000 cm3) to meet the performance metrics required for radiation portal monitors.

Our research project investigates two different methods to enhance intense laser interactions in order to accelerate protons and ions. One method involves using a machine learning algorithm, which is a form of artificial intelligence, to control the laser system. The other method involves splitting the laser pulse into two beams and using the constructive interference to as much as double the intensity on target without requiring additional laser energy. The goal of both methods is to maximize the numbers and the energies of the protons and ions ejected from intense laser interactions. An important part of our approach is that we will perform research on laser systems that can create many pulses per second in order to produce significant quantities of data that we can use to improve the results. We will also perform computer simulations to better understand why certain parameters improve the ion acceleration."

Consequently, higher altitude nucleation plays an important role in cloud properties and Earth’s radiative balance. Freshly formed particles have been observed in the upper boundary layer yet the nucleation processes that formed these particles remains poorly understood. This is primarily due to instrument limitations that prevent measurement of nucleation precursor gases above the ground level. As a result, little is known about how precursors are transported to higher altitudes and how their resulting nucleation rates impact aerosol number concentrations aloft. Project Objectives: The purpose of this project is to determine to what extent sulfuric acid-driven nucleation occurs aloft by measuring how nucleation precursor concentrations vary vertically and temporally at different altitudes above Lamont, Oklahoma. We propose three research objectives: (1) Develop and calibrate compact nucleation precursor counters capable of being launched on a tethered balloon system, (2) measure nucleation precursors and particles at various altitudes at the field site, and (3) understand how the measured vertical distribution of nucleation precursor concentrations contribute to sulfuric acid nucleation and how these distributions can be explained by meteorological conditions and vertical transport of gases. Technical Approach: (1) We will develop and deploy two, 1 nm condensation particles counters to measure gaseous concentrations of sulfuric acid and grouped contribution of compounds that enhance sulfuric acid-driven nucleation. In collaboration with Dr. Chongai Kuang (Brookhaven National Laboratory), these instruments will be developed and calibrated for operation on the tethered balloon system. (2) The precursor instruments, along with ground-based instrumentation including a high-resolution chemical ionization mass spectrometer and scanning mobility particle sizer will be deployed to the field site in coordination with Kuang and his campaign to measure vertically-resolved nucleation mode particles. We will measure sulfuric acid concentration and effective concentration of stabilizing compounds as a function of altitude. Ground-based measurements of sulfuric acid, other speciated nucleation precursors, and particle size distributions will also be conducted. (3) Measured nucleation precursors will be used to model sulfuric acid nucleation rates and concentration of nucleation mode particles as a function of time of day and vertical height. Predicted particle concentrations will then be compared to measured concentrations to determine if the sulfuric acid is the key driver of nucleation in Lamont, Oklahoma. Vertical distributions of nucleation precursors will be related to atmospheric turbulence and other meteorological conditions to determine how precursors are transported from the surface sources. Impact of Project: This project will provide process-level understanding on how nucleation in the boundary layer impacts cloud properties and thus Earth’s radiative budget. The project will produce a novel technique to measure gaseous nucleation precursors using a condensation particle counter that can be deployed in diverse locations. In addition, the project will provide insights into other aerosol processes beyond nucleation as these precursor gases also serve important roles in aerosol growth, aqueous chemistry, and cloud activation. Thus, vertically-resolved measurements of nucleation precursors will broadly improve understanding on how aerosol particles impact Earth’s radiative budget."

Our approach addresses the failure of reactions required for bio-production, due to inhibition, denaturation, mis-folding or disorder of individual enzymes. We will develop and implement a framework that first identifies these enzymes and then identifies their robust replacement enzymes from sets of extremophiles. The engineering strategy of replacing inhibited enzymes in order to improve bio-production is well-established, but rarely applied to system-wide stressors such as temperature and pH. We apply a systems genomics approach to improve bio-production under high temperatures and low intracellular pH as foci for two distinct stressors, with E. coli as the model organism. Butanol production at high temperature and succinate production at low pH have been selected as the model systems. This approach is complementary to efforts to improve microbial robustness by engineering the cell membrane and has advantages relative to evolutionary-based organism improvement by prioritizing bio-production rather than growth and by innovative ways of leveraging existing knowledge. Aim 1: Metabolic Systems Modeling. Flux balance analysis methods will be used to model changes in system temperature and intracellular pH through enzyme inhibition and changes to reaction thermodynamics. Models will be tuned with experimental data from Aim 3 and validated against existing literature data. An iterative process using these models, existing data and work from Aim 2 will be used to identify rate-limiting enzymes and evaluate the effects of their replacements. Aim 2: Computational Enzyme Assessment. Enzymes from thermophilic organisms known to be robust under high temperature and low pH conditions will be queried as replacements for the rate-limiting enzymes identified in Aim 1. This approach utilizes the huge and rapidly growing body of knowledge regarding protein sequence, structure and evolution. Sequence matching will be used to assess protein vulnerability and to identify candidate replacement enzymes. Structures of sequence variants will also incorporate entropy evaluations to assess protein stabilities. Aim 3: Organism Characterization and Engineering. Building on previously developed engineering strategies, the enzymes and replacements identified above will be recursively assessed for their impact on organism performance. Experimental data from Aim 3 will feed back to Aims 1 and 2. The final temperature-tolerant butanol producer and acid-tolerant succinate producer will both be characterized at the 0.5L-scale. Success in organism engineering will be judged in terms of the sensitivity of product titer, rate and yield to temperature or acidification. The tasks span three length scales: enzyme sequence (Aim 2), the performance of metabolic pathways as enzyme networks (Aim 1), and the functional output of metabolic pathways in the form of organism activity (Aim 3). Our approach strikes out on a new path to build on existing knowledge, by complementing existing organism with enzyme replacement strategies, and at the same time is generic in terms of production organism and product identity. The ability to adjust metabolic models for changes in temperature and intracellular pH is also relevant to systems analysis of food spoilage organisms and pathogenesis. This framework could also be applied to other stressors that impact enzyme activity, such as salinity and concentration of alcohols or solvents. The proposed approaches for enzyme robustness and stability could likewise be applied for the selection of enzymes for pan-organism in vitro systems, such as in the production of bioprivileged molecules that can serve as precursors for drop-in petroleum replacement and novel molecules."

While these fundamental deformation behaviors can be altered through both thermomechanical treatment as well as alloying as engineering solutions to these limitations, the origins in the differences in the ductility and formability of these materials remains unknown. We hypothesize that extrinsic point defects are responsible for the differences in these fundamental properties. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use an integrated experimental and modeling approach to investigate the origins of embrittlement in these materials with regard to the impurities, both the types of impurities and their concentration. The experiments will produce the necessary material properties, including dislocation mobility and intrinsic fracture behavior, for the models which will be able to determine if the impurities are responsible for the differences in mechanical properties as predicted from our models. These results, in conjunction with characterization and modeling efforts focused on understanding the deformation mechanisms, will provide fundamental insight into the differences in mechanical behaviors amongst the different BCC metals."

When the number of electric charges on each dust grain reaches ~102-104 electron charges, the electrostatic potential energy of the grains is either comparable or much higher than their kinetic energy. In such instances, the dust grains become strongly coupled due to strong electrostatic forces between them. Standard kinetic theories, used to describe dilute gases or weakly coupled dusty plasmas, are no longer valid to describe strongly coupled dusty plasmas because they ignore the interaction potential energy of the constituent grains. This theoretical investigation will quantify the effect of grain-grain, grain-plasma and grain-neutral gas interactions on the thermodynamic and transport properties of the grain phase. The central hypothesis to this effort is that the grain positions and velocity time series measured in dusty plasma experiments contain the information needed to calculate the evolution of the grain position and velocity distribution functions over time, without tedious numerical methods. Using the methods of statistical mechanics, grain trajectories from a combination of experiments and computer simulations will be used to construct accurate equilibrium (thermodynamic equations of state) and non-equilibrium (transport coefficients) models of strongly coupled dusty plasmas. The basic aspects of correlated grain motion of relevance to strongly coupled plasmas will be quantified as thermodynamic and transport models to fortify the prediction capabilities of hydrodynamic/fluid simulation approaches in order to accurately describe dust grain dynamics: (1) near the walls of thermonuclear fusion reactors where material ablation leads to the formation of highly charged nano or micro-particles, (2) in planet and asteroid formation processes via accretion of charged grains and particles, and (3) of intentional or unintentional gas-to-particle conversion in plasma-based nano-material synthetic routes processes or plasma-based semiconductor manufacturing."
Improving the Parameterization of Cloud and Rain Microphysics in E3SM using a Novel Observationally-Constrained Bayesian Approach,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021048,"Morrison, Hugh",Hugh.Morrison@universitycorporationforatmosphericresearch,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Motivation: Earth System Models (ESMs), including the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), suffer from biases in cloud properties. To some extent these biases can be mitigated by tuning free parameters associated with microphysics or other cloud-related parameterizations. However, a critical challenge is the fact that not all sources of parameterization error are easily adjusted or tuned. That is, most parameterization schemes suffer from so-called ``structural errors'' that are the result of fixed approximations, assumptions, and uncertain mathematical formulations. If structural errors could be addressed, then tuning can be performed such that optimal parameter values represent true physical knowledge. In this case, so-called ``bottom-up'' approaches to ESM model development, wherein parameterizations are revised to incorporate advances in process-level knowledge, can be reconciled with ``top-down'' approaches, wherein tuning is performed on the full ESM by relying on ``emergent properties'' of the climate system to constrain parameterizations. For parameterizing cloud microphysics, uncertainties exist at all levels of scheme complexity and scales. It is challenging to quantify these uncertainties rigorously in current microphysics schemes because many of their structural elements are fixed and “hard-coded” into scheme formulations. To address this challenge, we have recently developed a new bulk parameterization of microphysics, the Bayesian Observationally-constrained Statistical-physical Scheme (BOSS). This approach allows for systematic adjustment of scheme structure and quantification of structural and parametric uncertainties via Bayesian inference. It provides a consistent framework for uncertainty quantification and constraint using both bottom-up (e.g., from detailed process-level microphysical modeling) and top-down (e.g., from global satellite observations) approaches. In this way, BOSS facilitates a hierarchical approach to parameterization development and tuning. Proposed research: We will use BOSS to parameterize liquid (cloud and rain) microphysics in E3SM. Bottom-up and top-down experiments will be performed, using information from the former as prior probabilities for the latter — thus ensuring that the two are consistent. Our bottom-up approach will utilize column- and box-models with constraint of BOSS provided by a number of “reference” bin and bulk microphysics schemes, while our top-down tests will use BOSS integrated into the Morrison and Gettelman (MG2) microphysics parameterization in E3SM. For the top-down tests, we will employ a number of global satellite datasets as the constraint, representing a best estimate of climate- and cloud-relevant quantities. For all top-down experiments, microphysical parameters as well as those in other model parameterizations will be simultaneously perturbed. We will also compare a top-down ``control'' constraint of E3SM parameters with one where BOSS replaces the standard liquid microphysics parameterization, thus revealing any unique benefits of using BOSS. Expected outcomes: The main objective is an improved treatment of microphysics in E3SM, rigorously informed by state-of-the-art microphysical process models and optimally tuned against a set of extensive global satellite-derived observations. This will improve the representation of microphysics in warm clouds, which impacts climate sensitivity and is critical for modeling aerosol indirect effects and the hydrological cycle. While we expect this effort to yield tangible improvement in E3SM climate simulations and reduced uncertainty, this will also demonstrate the hierarchical, combined bottom-up and top-down Bayesian approach as a viable method for parameterization development, testing, and tuning in ESMs more broadly."
Beating Electronic Decoherence,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020994,"Li, Wen",Wen.Li@waynestateuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","In the past decade, the production and probing of coherent electron motion has been one of the major foci of attosecond spectroscopy. However, only a handful of atomic and molecular systems have been shown experimentally to manifest such dynamics while many more molecular systems have been modeled theoretically to exhibit electronic coherence. Recently, a potential cause for the discrepancy between theory and experiment was suggested by a few theory groups. They proposed that due to the delocalized nature of the nuclear wavepacket and different topologies of potential energy surfaces of the cation states in the Franck-Condon region, electronic decoherence is extremely fast, even before significant nuclear motion can take place. This is significant because long-lived electronic coherence is likely to enable manipulation of electronic and nuclear dynamics to steer chemical reactions, which is a long-standing goal of chemistry and physics. If this decoherence mechanism is confirmed experimentally, another important question arises: is it possible to beat electronic decoherence to produce long-lived electronic motion? This research project aims to beat electronic decoherence in two aspects: (1) developing experimental approaches that will capture the extremely fast decoherence process in the time-domain for the first time. (2) devising atomistic schemes that can suppress decoherence and produce long-lived electronic coherence in molecular system."

Therefore, reliably representing PBL processes in numerical models is critical for weather, climate, and air quality prediction. Currently, there are over ten PBL schemes that are selectable within the advanced research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, indicative of the challenges in capturing the impacts of turbulence within the PBL in models. Further improvements in PBL parameterizations are needed for both weather and climate models as emphasized in many recent national reports. Our ability to represent PBL processes depends on understanding the underlying boundary layer processes from observations. However, there are few routine measurements of the surface fluxes and PBL structure to support the PBL process study. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) megasite is one of few sites, if not the only site in the world, offering multi-year routine surface flux and PBL structure observations, especially with enhancements since 2016. The project takes advantages of ARM&rsquo;s recent investments in the atmospheric boundary layer observations and modeling to understand key physical processes controlling the mixed layer development and water vapor transport in the PBL because of their importance for cloud/precipitation development and improve their parameterizations in numerical models. The project has the following three main objectives: (1) Characterize PBL structure and variations: Long-term DOE ARM observations of fine-scale temperature, water vapor, and wind profiles from Raman lidar and Doppler lidar together with other measurements will be used to characterize the PBL structure, including PBL height, mixed layer height, vertical turbulent mixing and water vapor flux profile at the SGP site. The spatial and temporal variations of the PBL structure will be documented under different meteorological and thermodynamic conditions. (2) Understand processes controlling PBL variations: PBL evolutions are controlled by multi-scale processes, including surface fluxes, radiation, dynamics, and turbulence, as well as clouds and precipitation systems. The ARM facility at the SGP site offers the necessary complement of measurements for the process-oriented study. We will focus on processes important for mixed layer development and vertical water vapor transport because of their importance for cloud/precipitation development. The impact of land-atmosphere interactions on PBL developments will be constrained by observed surface latent and sensible heat fluxes. Analyses will be performed to understand the roles of multi-scale dynamics interactions in controlling the mixed layer development and vertical water transport, the impacts of meteorological and thermodynamic conditions on PBL evolution, and the surface and cloud/precipitation control of PBL spatial heterogeneity at the SGP site. (3) Improve PBL modeling in WRF: The third objective tries to evaluate and improve the PBL parameterizations in representing turbulent mixing of moisture in the convective boundary layer (CBL) regime using the following approaches. First, we will combine the validated Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) ARM Symbiotic Simulation and Observation (LASSO) and Land-Atmosphere Feedback Experiment (LAFE) LES simulations and observational results to explore ways to improve the PBL parameterizations. Second, we will perform Single Column Model (SCM) simulations under the observational constraints to discover the consistent deficiencies of selected WRF PBL schemes using both observations and validated LASSO simulations and test potential improvements for the selected schemes. The SCM framework provides an observation-constrained setup to better isolate the PBL parameterized physics from dynamics-physics coupled system. Third, we will conduct three-dimensional WRF simulations using the original and updated PBL schemes for two to three LASSO and/or LAFE cases to assess the performance or improvement of modified PBL schemes in the CBL regime."

Our team plans to leverage the genomic and molecular characterization capacities at the DoE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) and the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) to elucidate and characterize the underlying mechanisms of how these new strains yield desirable bioesters and other bioproducts. Specifically, we will detail how these Y. lipolytica 1) tolerate and effectively assimilate inhibitory biomass hydrolysates for superior lipid accumulation under industrial relevant conditions, 2) tolerate organic solvents that are required to produce biofuels and bioproducts in a two-phase fermentation system, and 3) endogenously degrade lipids to produce targeted esters. Accomplishing these objectives will result in the needed tools to implement a novel process that allows for economical in situ production and integrated recovery of custom esters. This foundational knowledge will also provide the insight necessary for engineering Yarrowia strains for production of a wide variety of biofuels and bioproducts from lignocellulosic biomass."
Systems Biology-Based Optimization of Extremely Thermophilic Lignocellulose Conversion to Bioproducts,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019391,"Adams, Michael","Michael.Adams@theuniversityofgeorgiaresearchfoundation,inc.","['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","We propose to use systems biology-guided approaches to develop a non-model, microbial metabolic engineering platform based on the most thermophilic lignocellulose-degrading organism known, Caldicellulosiruptor bescii, which grows optimally at 78&deg;C. We will apply the latest metabolic reconstruction and modeling approaches to optimize biomass to product conversion using switchgrass and poplar as the model plants. Bio-processing above 70&deg;C can have important advantages over near-ambient operations. Highly genetically modified microorganisms usually have a fitness disadvantage and can be easily overtaken in culture when contaminating microbes are present. The high growth temperature of extreme thermophiles precludes growth or survival of virtually any contaminating organism or phage. This reduces operating costs associated with reactor sterilization and maintaining a sterile facility. In addition, at industrial scales, heat production from microbial metabolic activity vastly outweighs heat loss through bioreactor walls such that cooling is required. Extreme thermophiles have the advantage that non-refrigerated cooling water can be used if needed, and heating requirements can be met with low-grade steam typically in excess capacity on plant sites. The over-arching goal is to demonstrate that a non-model microorganism, specifically an extreme thermophile, can be a strategic metabolic engineering platform for industrial biotechnology."

Unfortunately, current models are unable to accurately represent all of the important chemical components due to challenges in identifying details of biogeochemical processes occurring within the terrestrial environment that have a significant impact on the atmosphere above. This is especially true for soil microbial emissions of reactive nitrogen (e.g., nitrous acid, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide), which directly and indirectly affect climate by controlling the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, lifetime of greenhouse gases, and formation rate of aerosols. This project will provide an improved mechanistic understanding of the fate of reactive nitrogen in soil that will enable these processes to be more accurately scaled from the laboratory to the ecosystem and global scales. A unique multidisciplinary approach will be taken to examine how variability in land surfaces and soil properties impact reactive nitrogen emissions, and to link soil fluxes of these gases to their microbial sources using a combination of laboratory and field studies, isotopic analysis, and genomic techniques. In addition, this research will leverage DOE investments in instrumentation at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) to study the effect of biogenic emissions of reactive nitrogen on the oxidative capacity of the soil environment and to understand how this is then coupled to the combined land-atmosphere carbon cycle. Results will be parameterized and included in the Community Earth System Model (CESM), with the goal of improving representation of the land-atmosphere exchange of reactive nitrogen in global climate models. These outcomes will support the Biological & Environmental Research Program’s goal of “discovering the physical, chemical, and biological drivers and environmental impacts of climate change.”"

Furthermore, because fossil fuels are subject to increasing costs of extraction and large price fluctuations, our reliance on these resources compromises long-term energy security in the U.S. Hydrogen (H2) is an attractive alternative fuel with a high energy density and clean combustion. Furthermore, when produced from water in a light-driven reaction, H2 represents the storage of solar energy as a carbon-free fuel. As such, developing new and efficient approaches to solar H2 production would have a positive impact on the U.S. energy infrastructure. The overall goal of this research program is developing and understanding integrated nanosystems for converting light energy into chemical energy through the production of H2. A centerpiece of these systems consists of crystalline cadmium chalcogenide semiconductor nanoparticles that harvest and convert light energy. When photoexcited, these nanocrystals separate electrons from holes; the electrons are used to produce H2, and the holes are transferred to a sacrificial acceptor. Two types of nanocrystals will be used: zero-dimensional quantum dots, and two-dimensional nanoplatelets. Quantum dots are well-established components of systems for solar H2 production, but details of how their surface properties and passivating ligands impact reactivity remain poorly understood. Nanoplatelets offer the advantage of well-defined surface structure and an increased probability of a physically charge-separated excited state. To pair with these nanocrystals, two types of cocatalysts are developed in this project. One consists of coordination complexes featuring first-row transition metals and ligands that dissociate from the nanoparticle, yielding a self-assembling cocatalyst. The second class of cocatalyst consists of engineered metallobiomolecules, which feature active sites with well-defined coordination spheres and microenvironments. Finally, to harvest holes from nanocrystals, polyoxovanadate (POV)-alkoxide clusters are developed. Hole transfer from CdSe-type nanocrystals is slow and may be rate-limiting in integrated systems for visible light-driven H2 production, and thus POV-alkoxides are used as hole-transfer agents that enhance overall H2-production activity. Numerous methods will be employed from the fields of biology, chemistry, optics, and materials science during this project. These methods include (but are not limited to) protein engineering, inorganic synthesis, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, electron microscopy, multidimensional ultrafast electronic spectroscopy, and electrochemistry. This project addresses important fundamental challenges in the field of energy science including mechanisms of fuel-forming catalysis, effects of nanocrystal structures on catalysis and charge transfer, the role of proton shuttles in photocatalytic systems, and the impact of physical and electronic structures of nanocrystals and POV clusters on hole-transfer kinetics. Addressing these questions is expected to yield more efficient systems for forming H2, as well as other solar fuels."

Predictions of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in tidal wetlands are highly uncertain. Eddy covariance (EC) towers provide ecosystem-scale GHG flux data at a temporal resolution (every 30min) that is helpful for parameterizing and improving mechanistic realism in ESMs. We propose to use a network of eddy covariance towers and standardized ancillary data streams, along with mesocosm experiments and statistical analyses, across diverse tidal wetlands of North America to develop and improve biogeochemical modeling at the TAI. Our overarching objective is to improve understanding and process-based modeling of gross primary productivity (GPP) and CH4 emission responses, both non-linear and asynchronous, to stressors including plant inundation, disturbance, salinity and nitrogen loading. Observational and Experimental Measurements and Analyses Our network of 7 eddy covariance towers will measure net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and CH4 along with critical ancillary variables including water table height, plant inundation, porewater and tidal channel salinity and nitrate, and soil respiration measurements. First, we will develop new algorithms for partitioning net ecosystem exchange measurements of CO2 (NEE) into GPP and ecosystem respiration (Reco) and validate the new algorithms using stable isotope partitioning. Using the flux and ancillary data streams across the tower network, we will use statistical analyses (i.e. piecewise regressions, wavelets and information theory) to identify thresholds and lag responses between GPP and CH4 emissions and changes in plant inundation, salinity and nitrate across multiple temporal scales (e.g. diel-interannual). Thresholds and non-linear or asynchronous responses detected in statistical analyses will be targeted using mesocosm experiments where inundation, salinity and nitrate pulses will be studied under controlled conditions. Biogeochemical Model Development The observational and experimental data and statistical analyses will be used to inform model structural improvements of a tidal wetland biogeochemical model MEM-PEPRMT. MEM-PEPRMT will be parameterized using a Model-Data Fusion approach. The CH4 submodule of MEM-PEPRMT will be compared with a machine learning model built using CH4 emission data. MEM-PEPRMT model performance will be evaluated against the validation dataset (a subset of sites not included in model parameterization) and the machine learning model. Finally, the improved MEM-PEPRMT model will be compared with PFLOTRAN-E3SM at an independent site in the Chesapeake Bay, an ESM that has recently been adapted for improved performance in tidal wetlands. This comparison will help inform how model structure and structural error in ESMs can be improved and quantified, respectively. Our research will improve predictive modeling of GPP and CH4 by ESMs in tidal marshes, a critical but poorly constrained TAI that plays a disproportionately large role in soil carbon storage."

For example, a detailed microscopic understanding of energy and charge transport between molecules is important for designing inorganic and organic semiconductor materials, coherent control of photocatalytic reactions, and obtaining a detailed understanding of photosynthetic energy transfer mechanisms. The combination of experimental measurements and computational modeling is necessary to fully elucidate these complex problems, but one major obstacle is the rapid increase of computational cost (computer time) with the size of the molecule or system studied. The goal of this research is to break this barrier by developing the tensor hypercontraction coupled cluster (THC-CC) approximation into an accurate, efficient, and practical tool for simulating the structure and dynamics of molecular excited states. As a reduced-scaling method, the decrease in computer time for THC-CC compared to traditional approaches improves rapidly with molecular size and will enable entirely new application areas. This research will combine a number of approaches and techniques including orbital localization, reduced-scaling tensor factorization, data compression via H-matrices, and analytic gradient theory to produce a practical THC-CC implementation which can calculate energetic, geometric, and electrical properties of both ultra-violet/visible and x-ray excited states. In particular, the dynamics of excited states will be addressed by developing exact analytic gradients for both ground and excited states. Additionally, this research will include pilot applications to the photostability properties of both natural and artificial/modified nucleobases and environmental effects thereon, and to the study of singlet and triplet dynamics in organic photovoltaic materials, including microscopic singlet fission/triplet fusion dynamics."

While advances have accelerated our ability to create large data, the ability to share and analyze these datasets has struggled to keep pace. Through the technological advances of this project, the simple, intuitive, and wide-reaching use of large scientific data will be possible. First, this project will develop technologies allowing scientists to search repositories of scientific data using intuitive examples. Specifically, it will create new machine learning approaches to map scientific data to a concise representation, a hash, that will allow similarity calculations between datasets to scale massively. These fast, scalable comparisons will allow scientists to interactively search vast databases to find similar or dissimilar datasets. This project will develop learned hashes that define similarity between datasets either directly through labels created by domain experts or indirectly via features that describe the fundamental structure of data. In addition, these new hashing methods will ignore the noise in data and allow large data to be fully queried, comparing features at all scales. Next, this project will explore innovative data reduction and post-transfer reconstruction approaches that provide both efficient data transfer and accurate analyses. Large data are usually sent initially at a reduced size, with data fidelity increased over time through progressive data transfers. This project will design novel data structures that will provide accurate analytics at all points of this progression. In addition, the project will develop new approaches to skip this additional data transfer, using machine learning to reconstruct datasets locally. Finally, this work will develop formal models that describe interactive computer systems for the visual analysis of large data. Current systems in this space must leverage many algorithmic accelerators for performance and handle the variability of distributed processing and storage while maintaining the strict feedback times required for interactivity. This complexity often leads to complicated system deployments using ad-hoc configurations. This project will develop the first models that formally describe the complexities of these systems. Using these models in a formal design will result in large-data systems that are maintainable, testable, predictable, scalable and - ultimately - simple to deploy. In addition to its research objectives, this project will develop new systems for large image segmentation and anomaly detection in simulations.

Interspecies metabolic exchanges directly influence the functional organization of these communities, where each member fulfills specific functions according to the enzymes it produces, i.e. its niche. This metabolic collaboration thereby allows the community to achieve functions that are unreachable by axenic community members, thus directly affecting the ecosystem. Effective and robust conversion of complex biomass in nature, e.g. in soil or peat bogs, is always performed by multifaceted communities. Even in higher animals, like cows or humans, diverse communities ensure the conversion of complex biomass to satisfy the high energy demand of the host by providing large quantities of short chain fatty acids, such as acetic, propionic, and butyric acid. While evolution has clearly favored communities to generate short chain fatty acids from complex biomass, the vast majority of bioproduction processes has been focused on single organism systems. Through both top-down and bottom-up approaches, we seek to vastly increase our understanding and ability to design complex multi-organism systems to enable the robust deconstruction and conversion of biomass. By unraveling the underlying principles and contributions of individual organisms to optimized functionality in complex communities, we will develop a knowledge base and working pipeline that enables microbial community design for the production of advanced biofuels and bioproducts from biomass. At the foundational level, we will leverage a mutualistic co-culture that has recently been developed, consisting of Clostridium thermocellum and Clostridium thermobutyricum, for the highly effective conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to butyric acid. Butyric acid has numerous applications from cosmetics to animal feed to biofuel precursors and will serve as our model target end-product in this study. Notably, C. thermocellum and C. thermobutyricum are frequently found together in nature, and indeed for several decades it was believed that C. thermocellum was a native butyrate producer. We will unravel the metabolic interactions of this co-culture and augment the co-culture with additional microbes to further increase the versatility of variable biomass conversion, stability against perturbation, and improvement of bioproductivity. Moreover, we will design engineering strategies for increased performance of this community, resulting in a complete conversion of biomass including deconstruction and metabolic assimilation of sugars to generate butyric acid. The primary objective of this project is to elucidate fundamental mechanisms driving commensal biomass conversion and to define community design principles. This will be achieved by i) developing a computational framework that enables metabolic modeling of communities with increasing complexity to improve community robustness and bioproduction, ii) generating multi-member communities for improved biomass deconstruction and butyric acid production by deploying an innovative high-throughput screening approach, iii) next-generation integration of multi-omics data to unravel mechanistic insights into community interactions, and iv) systems biology-guided engineering of communities for complete conversion of different biomass and optimized bioproduction.The outcomes of this proposal will lay the foundation for bioproduction using multifaceted microbial communities. We will build metabolic community models of increasing complexity by integrating multi-omics datasets. These models will guide engineering designs for optimized production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Furthermore, we will use innovative approaches to augment existing communities for improved bioproduction and complete conversion of different biomass feedstock. Overall, these strategies will provide knowledge of the functional metabolic exchanges driving interspecies interactions in microbial communities, thus providing insights into fundamental biological processes. Lessons learned here would be crucial for our ability to design stable microbial communities for various biotechnology applications in the future."

Increasing the efficiency, or performance, of these programs necessitates understanding the interactions between the program itself, the data it operates on, the libraries it uses, and the hardware on which it runs. Poor performance can be due to previously unseen scenarios that therefore cannot be checked automatically. Some of the information needed to understand these scenarios may be known to developers but not available in machine-interpretable form. Furthermore, often one needs a mental model of how the program and resources behave before they can formulate performance optimization strategies. Visualization encompasses a class of methods in exploratory data analysis that use the human visual system to aid reasoning and understanding. It can be particularly helpful in situations where too little is known to directly compute or estimate the desired answer. The performance analysis of supercomputing applications is one such case. However, current performance visualizations are not designed for the scale of the performance data that is presently collected nor the complexity of performance factors such as the source code, input data, libraries, and hardware. These problems are magnified when attempting to compare performance between multiple executions of the same program. This project focuses on developing and evaluating scalable, interactive visual approaches that allow performance analysts to connect factors in performance from the hardware nodes on which the programs run to their source code and compare across multiple executions, thereby enabling them to understand and ultimately improve the efficiency of their applications.

One advantage of these worm microbiomes is their ability to rapidly process without pretreatment a wide array of plastics found in ubiquitous drink containers and food packaging. In particular, the microbiome of the yellow mealworm (larvae of Tenebrio molitor) is exceptionally versatile and appears to be unique in that it processes these materials. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms used by these microbial communities to degrade wastes, the role of various microbes in metabolism, or the importance of relationships between bacteria, fungi, and archaea within these communities. To address these knowledge gaps, the project uses top-down and bottom-up approaches to probe the function of these complex communities and develop efficient systems for the processing of various plastics. Specifically, we pursue host enrichment strategies to assess the ability of mealworm microbiomes to process mixed plastic wastes, including those contaminated with common food wastes. Proteins and microbes in the community will be profiled to identify novel plastic degradation strategies. To probe molecular-level interactions that drive plastic degradation, we apply a PhenoProfiling strategy based around engineered fluorescently-labelled probes that mimic plastic substrates and degradation products, and serve as bait for desired microbes and proteins. Tagged microbial populations will be isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) on the basis of probe affinity or activity and other physical properties to zoom in on the molecular role of individual species or taxa in plastics degradation. In addition to the rich integrated omics analyses developed from these subpopulations, we will also pursue bottom-up reconstruction of plastic degrading communities to tease out design rules for plastics degradation. Finally, identified enzymes will be tested and optimized for expression in engineered microbes and plastic degradation pathways will be optimized in cultivated microbiomes for efficient processing of plastic wastes. This project probes microbial metabolism of significant sources of plastic wastes with next generation high throughput omics techniques. Coupled with our novel PhenoProfiling platform and associated biochemical and functional data, the proposed work promises truly molecular-level insights into plastic degradation pathways that decipher the roles of individual microbial taxa.

This phenomenon, termed cellular noise, may seem insignificant at the global scale; however, its importance is ascertained when considering that most cell populations, natural communities, and infections start from a single or just a few cells. By now it has been established that cellular noise can confer robustness to a biological system, namely the ability to maintain function in the presence of environmental fluctuations. To this end, cellular noise imposes a non-genetic form of division of labor and, as such, some cells of the population can express pathways that enable them to continue functioning in the new environment. While the effects of cellular noise have been extensively investigated in the context of microbial physiology and disease, our knowledge of how to engineer cellular noise and design robust biosystems in a synthetic biology context remains at its infancy. To address this knowledge-gap, this project develops an integrative workflow that combines genome-wide editing methods, multi-omic and single-cell analyses, and computational models. The project then applies this workflow to bestow robust cellulosic oil and alkane production in Yarrowia lipolytica under genuine industrial conditions that exhibit varying concentrations of toxic lignocellulosic hydrolysate inhibitors and temperatures. Our approach involves first evolving Y. lipolytica by both rational and combinatorial means to obtain tolerant and overproducing variants, followed by multi-omics analyses and construction of genome-wide metabolic kinetic models. These models subsequently guide the noise engineering efforts followed by robustness validation in programmable microfluidics and large-scale bioreactors. Overall, we anticipate that the proposed noise engineering project will not only yield robust biosystems but also novel design principles that enable efficient bioproduction beyond standard laboratory settings."
Size-resolved particle and black carbon deposition over the cryosphere,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020075,"Farmer, Delphine",Delphine.Farmer@coloradostateuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Aerosols are small liquid or solid particles suspended in the atmosphere, and are the strongest driver of uncertainties in understanding climate. Wet and dry deposition are the key processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere &ndash; and thus control their concentration and lifetime in the atmosphere. Presently, there are serious problems with the existing understanding of depositions rates, stemming from the lack of direct measurements. Black carbon is one type of aerosol that is particularly important as it is a short-lived climate forcer, and its deposition to the cryosphere (surfaces covered by snow or ice) increases absorption of sunlight by the surface, enhancing snow aging and melting and generating positive climate feedbacks. There is a clear need for additional observational constraints and investigation of aerosol deposition, including measurements of black carbon, which we propose to address by performing the first unambiguous direct eddy flux covariance measurements of both total and black carbon aerosol dry deposition over the cryosphere. By measuring black carbon concentration and size in the snow, we will distinguish wet removal rates for this species from dry rates. We propose measurements of total and black carbon deposition at two sites &ndash; first a local site in Colorado that will allow us to optimize measurement approaches and investigate snow-covered forested areas, and the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility at the Oliktok Point site on the North Slope of Alaska. The Alaska site is particularly relevant to understanding anthropogenic influences on the remote Arctic. We will compare our measurements to model parameterizations to constrain uncertainties and systematic bias, and improve deposition parameterizations. We will assess the possibility for achieving full deposition budget closure using snow measurements of black carbon. This work will fundamentally improve understanding of aerosol removal processes from the atmosphere over the cryosphere."

Identifying, modeling, and analyzing the multiscale, multisystem response options and cross-system implications requires not only an understanding of multisector teleconnections in the coupled human and Earth system, but also how interconnected systems are exposed to hazards that create vulnerabilities and risks for society and how societies respond to these risks. To address this challenge, this project seeks to answer three new, critical, and interrelated research questions: (1) How can we characterize and quantify the propagation of hazards (flood, water scarcity, wildfire) through the MSD system, affecting the exposure and vulnerability of populations and human built systems to these hazards? (2) How do these populations and physical systems respond to these risks and how do those responses feed back to the MSD system as part of a fully coupled, co-evolutionary human and natural Earth system? (3) What are the features and characteristics that fundamentally give rise to resilient human and institutional response strategies? The project will utilize and extend previously-developed MSD frameworks with new work aimed at understanding human and institutional responses to hazards in conjunction with the quantification and characterization of hazards. A particular focus is to identify, characterize, and compare risk management strategies and adaptive measures and their implications for systems resilience. Variation across case studies is key to identifying these characteristics. Therefore, the team will (i) vary hazards within a region to identify interplay between hazards and (ii) vary regions for a specific hazard to identify regional differences in impacts and responses to a specific hazard. This will allow the team to understand and model how strategies differ depending on the type of hazard and region under consideration. The project comprises two regional case studies—water stress and wildfires in the US West, and water stress and flooding in the Great Plains and Upper Midwest—that will form the basis of three intercomparison exercises. The first is an intercomparison of water stress responses and implications in the West and Great Plains. The second is an intercomparison of flooding responses and implications in the Upper Midwest, Gulf Coast, and East Coast. Lastly, the team will also conduct a method intercomparison of uncertainty characterization and quantification (UC/UQ) techniques to test how generalizable the chosen UC/UQ methodological approach is to alternative modeling frameworks and applications. This project will result in the development of new insights and methods for risk identification, characterization, and responses that will be tested and refined within the project, as well as shared and compared with methods being developed by other research teams. The research design proposed here will allow alternative approaches to these critical analytical challenges to be compared and contrasted within a “test-bed” like environment rather than seeking to identify a single dominant consensus modeling framework. This research strategy should enable the team to achieve its research objectives while also providing large synergistic benefits to other MSD research teams and the broader research community."
Elucidation of the Roles of Diazotrophic Endophyte Communities in Promoting Productivity and Resilience of Populus through Systems Biology Approaches,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021137,"Doty, Sharon",Sharon.Doty@universityofwashington,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","The plant microbiome, made up of the many micro-organisms that interact with plants, can have a profound influence on the growth and health of any given plant. Poplar trees are important feedstocks for bioenergy and ecosystem services, but more efficient and resilient growth is essential for environmental sustainability. In their native habitat of rocky riverbanks, poplar trees host a diverse assembly of micro-organisms that help them to survive in this harsh environment. Some of the micro-organisms which make up the poplar microbiome can help poplar grow by providing the required nutrients of nitrogen and available phosphorus, which are lacking in the rock and sand dominated riversides. In addition to increasing nutrient acquisition, the micro-organisms can also promote plant tolerance to other environmental stresses including drought. Previously we demonstrated that adding micro-organisms from the wild poplar microbiome to a wide variety of other plants increased the health and growth of these plants under a variety of conditions. The overall goal of the proposed work is to understand how, at a molecular level, the micro-organisms within the poplar tree microbiome can affect the host plant health and stress tolerance. Using systems biology approaches at both lab and field scales, we will identify the metabolic and physiological impacts of the bio-inoculants on the host plant under nutrient stress and water limitation. We will then integrate the plant physiology data with the molecular plant-microbe interactions data to develop a systems-level understanding of the genetic and molecular basis for diazotrophic (nitrogen-fixing) endophytic mutualisms. This deeper level of understanding of the plant responses will guide construction of microbial communities that best prime plant pathways for enduring abiotic stresses to optimize the impacts of bioinoculants for environmental sustainability and vigor of bioenergy crops."
A Systems Understanding of Nitrogen-Fixation on the Aerial Roots of Sorghum,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021052,"Ane, Jean-Michel","Jean-Michel.Ane@boardofregentsoftheuniversityofwisconsinsystem,operatingasuniversityofwisconsin-madison","['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Since the Green Revolution, the intensive use of synthetic fertilizers is the most common strategy to alleviate the limitation of nitrogen (N) availability on crop yields. With the desire to produce bioenergy crops on low-productivity lands to avoid competition with food production, the heavy use of fertilizers necessary to ensure reasonable yields not only increases the cost of production but also increases the environmental footprint of producing bioenergy crops. Besides the significant energy inputs from natural gas, a non-renewable resource, required to produce synthetic fertilizers, the use of fertilizers also comes with adverse environmental effects such as nitrate leaching and the production of greenhouse gases. Taking advantage of biological N fixation in bioenergy crops like sorghum is a promising approach to reduce the dependence on synthetic fertilizers and improve the economic and environmental sustainability of bioenergy production. We have reported recently that some corn landraces from the Sierra Mixe region in Mexico can acquire 29–82% of their N from the air by hosting N-fixing bacteria in a mucilage produced by aerial roots after rain. Initially considered to be a trait unique to this corn, we have now demonstrated that some sorghum accessions also support efficient N-fixation in the mucilage produced by their aerial roots and obtain a significant amount of N from the air through such symbiotic associations. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand better the molecular and cellular networks controlling this N-fixation trait in sorghum using a combination of genetics, synthetic bacterial communities, and systems biology. Our overall hypotheses are that plant and bacterial gene networks control the efficiency of N-fixation in sorghum and that understanding these networks will allow us to improve N-fixation in sorghum for bioenergy production. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will carry out the following aims: Identify sorghum accessions that maximize N-fixation via their aerial roots and use genome-wide association studies to map biological N fixation-related traits (GWAS). We will assess the dependence of N-fixation on environmental factors such as rain and soil N, map genetic loci that associate with the trait, and start breeding improved bioenergy sorghum varieties able to fix N efficiently. Characterize the bacterial communities associated with these sorghum accessions in the field. We will isolate bacteria from sorghum mucilage and evaluate phenotypes related to mucilage degradation and utilization, oxygen consumption, N-fixation, and N transfer to the plant. Develop simplified and representative bacterial communities of the sorghum aerial mucilage and study their dynamics. We will explore the functional and compositional design space of synthetic communities using high-throughput techniques and computational modeling, test the stability of synthetic communities, infer significant inter-species interactions, and sequence the genomes of the most promising isolates. Characterize the integrated plant and microbial gene networks controlling critical functions in the system using a synthetic bacterial community. We will profile the transcriptome of plant and bacterial genes during mucilage production and N fixation, infer cell type-specific gene regulatory networks and their dynamics, and predict plant and bacterial regulators. Validate the predictions of the systems biology approach using genetics in plants and bacteria to improve the efficiency of N-fixation in sorghum aerial root mucilage. We will use reverse genetics in sorghum and in bacteria to test predictions in the lab and the field and confirm the key elements needed to support biological N fixation in sorghum. This proposal will help to understand and improve the unique capabilities of N-fixation in aerial roots of the bioenergy crop sorghum to support high biomass productivity on marginal lands, with a reduction in both inputs and environmental impacts."

Thompson, Michigan State University (Co-Investigator) The objective of this project is to develop and use tools to improve the efficiency and cost benefit equation of using reverse-genetics to characterize gene function in plants. Based on preliminary data from maize and arabidopsis, genes previously functional characterized in each species share a common signature based on a number of structural, population genetic, and evolutionary features. Here we will develop, employ, and validate machine learning approaches to these these data types to predict which genes in the genome of sorghum represent the ""low hanging"" and ""high hanging"" fruit for functional characterization through reverse genetics (Objective 1A). In parallel, we will use new multi-trait-multi-marker quantitative genetic statistical approaches to identify associations between genes and multiple conventionally and high throughput measured traits in sorghum association populations (Objective 1B). Physiologically informed crop growth models and statistical methods adapted from the BayesCpi approach to genomic prediction will be used to identify component traits which are under primarily genetic, as opposed to environmental, control and contribute significantly to composite traits relevant to DOE mission relevance, such as biomass production in differing environments (Objective 2). The combination of these three sets of data types/predictions -- prioritized rankings of component traits most likely to influence biomass production, prioritized rankings of which genes in the genome are more likely to be amenable to genetic characterization, and new and more accurate estimates of which genes are responsible for controlling which traits -- will be used to identify a small number (8) of sorghum genes for gene editing and phenomic characterization across two or more environments using conventional and high throughput phenotyping (Objective 3). Successful completion of Objective 1A will provide ongoing benefits to gene characterization efforts across diverse emerging biomass and biofuel plant systems within the Department of Energy's Office of Science Biology and Environmental Research's mission portfolio by allowing researchers to start with the low hanging fruit of genes which do not yet have characterized functions based on homology, yet are more likely to be amenable to genetic characterization, before advancing onward to the high hanging fruit of genes with far more difficult to characterize functions. Successful completion of Objective 1B will address a need for new approaches to most effectively utilize the large number of distinct traits high throughput plant phenotyping systems are now capable of scoring to link individual genes to individual suites of functions. Successful completion of Objective 2 will identify biological mechanisms as targets for functional genetic analysis. Objective 3 acts as a functional validation of the new statistical and computation methods developed and employed as part of Objectives 1A, 1B, and 2, both adding value and potential providing feedback to improve predictions. However, successful completion of Objective 3 will result in the characterization of the role ten previously unstudied sorghum genes play in specifying the organismal traits and phenotypes of sorghum across multiple environments independent of the success or failure of Objectives 1A, 1B and 2. Success of the project as a whole would result in a new framework and set of computational, statistical, and genetic tools which could be deployed in any DOE mission-relevant species to significantly increase the ""bang-per-buck"" of future efforts to characterize the functions of previously unstudied genes."

Thermodynamic analysis can help us understand how energy is transferred and transformed within metabolic networks and has emerged as a powerful tool for pathway design and metabolic engineering. This project will integrate thermodynamic analysis with advanced mass spectrometry, computational modeling, and metabolic engineering to develop an approach for in vivo determination of Gibbs free energies (&Delta;G) in metabolic networks. This project will also investigate how the thermodynamics of biosynthetic pathways in microbial biofuel producers change dynamically as substrates are depleted or products accumulate. This research will result in the construction of computational models that quantitatively define trade-offs between energy efficiency of biosynthetic pathways and their overall catalytic rates. The approach developed in this project will be useful for identifying thermodynamic bottlenecks in native and synthetic pathways and pinpoint the enzymes whose expression levels will have the largest effect on production rates and final product yields.

Foundations of Molecular 'Isotomics',Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0016561,"Eiler, John",John.Eiler@californiainstituteoftechnology,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Most molecules, particularly organics, exist in large numbers (generally thousands to millions) of naturally occurring isotopic forms that differ in their numbers and/or atomic sites of rare isotope substitutions. For example, the essential amino acid methionine (C5H11NO2S) can contain a rare carbon isotope, 13C, in any one of its 5 non-equivalent carbon positions, or a rare nitrogen isotope, 15N, in its one nitrogen site, or a rare isotope of H, O or S, or any combination of two or more of these rare isotope substitutions. In all there are 746,496 isotopic 'versions' of this molecule, each of which is in some sense unique, differing from the others in chemical stability, solubility, rates of chemical reactions, rates of diffusion through water, among other chemical and physical properties. Because the isotopic forms of molecules differ in their properties, many chemical and physical processes discriminate among them, creating or destroying them at different rates. This means that molecular isotopic structures - the specific probabilities of rare isotope substitution in each atomic site or combinations of sites - differ between samples of a molecule that have different origins. The combination of these two things - diversity in isotopic structure and discrimination among isotopic forms - means that measurements of molecular isotopic structure have tremendous potential for forensic discrimination among molecules of different sources, and as a record of the sources, processes and environments of molecular formation. When one considers the great diversity of isotopic forms of most molecules, studies of isotopic structure offer us the opportunity for a 'genetics of everything' - an analytical tool kit that could let us recognize and interpret the unique origins of virtually any chemical compound. Such a tool kit would address applied questions in fundamental chemistry, forensics, biomedical science, geochemistry, environmental pollution, climate change, among other subjects. However, virtually none of the isotopic diversity that must exist in natural molecular structures has ever been observed, largely because of the narrow range of capabilities of existing methods for observing them. Most of the modern study of natural distributions of isotopes is based on measurements of bulk isotope abundance ratios (e.g., 13C/12C), irrespective of the molecular sites of rare isotope substitution or the probabilities of multiple substitutions in the same molecule. To understand how limiting this window on isotopic diversity is, imagine how little we would benefit from the field of genetics if we could only observe the chemical formulas of genes (e.g., their N/C ratios) rather than their specific chemical structures. The purpose of this research program is to create a &lsquo;toolkit&rsquo; of analytical technologies and fundamental understanding of chemical isotope effects that can be routinely applied to a wide range of problems in the natural and applied sciences, and to illustrate the usefulness of this toolkit through application to impactful problems in the geosciences and applied sciences. Over the last two and a half years of this program, we have: &bull; Established the capacity of high resolution mass spectrometry, particularly Fourier Transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) to accurately and precisely observe molecular isotopic structures of a wide range of chemical compounds &bull; Developed technologies and methods that allow this approach to be quickly adapted to a variety of compounds and sample types &bull; Applied these technologies and methods to understand fundamental isotope effects associated with important biological and non-biological mechanisms of amino acid synthesis. Amino acids are key metabolites in all living things and common products of non-biological organic reactions, meaning these studies give us a means of approaching many possible applied problems in the life and geosciences. &bull; Used these approaches and constraints to study the origins of amino acids in primitive meteorites and to forensically distinguish natural and synthetic chemo- from bio-synthetic amino acids. In the coming years we will strengthen these technologies, improve our ability to interpret molecular isotopic structures using principles of isotope chemistry, and pioneer new areas of application. Specific goals include: &bull; Improve the sensitivity, precision, and automation of our measurement methods, and establish the ability to study isotopic structures of large biomolecules, such as proteins. &bull; Codify and disseminate a standard &lsquo;tool kit&rsquo; of methods that can be followed to apply our approaches in other laboratories. &bull; Construct a generalized model for predicting and interpreting molecular isotopic structures, in a way that can be applied quickly and by non-specialists to diverse problems in natural and applied chemistry &bull; Pursue applied studies that take advantage of the power of molecular isotopic structure to solve problems concerning the chemistry of amino acids, organic compounds in geological samples that trace the earliest history of life on earth, and forensics of chemicals that are significant for national security problems - work we will do in collaboration with leading groups at the DOE National Labs. Success at these tasks will establish a novel technology that can be generalized to the study of isotopic anatomies of many organic compounds, with implications for our fundamental understanding of the origins of key organic molecules (such as amino acids), and impactful applications in life sciences, forensics, environmental sciences and other fields."

For the majority of plant genes knowledge of their function, especially the association of gene to phenotype, remains stubbornly incomplete despite focused efforts by the plant research community. This proposal focuses on the biofuel trait of seed oil synthesis as a proof of concept for an approach developed that is extensible to any agronomic/biofuel trait of interest. For a given trait of interest, we predict novel TF regulators by leveraging the power of large expression data sets in a model species and then translate that knowledge to a target biofuel species for immediate benefit to the DOE mission. Two of the principal challenges in determining gene function are: 1. Subtle phenotypes that occur in organ and/or developmental stage specific manner and 2. Functional redundancy among gene family members masks phenotypic effects via genetic or dosage compensation. In this project, we will develop a general approach that addresses these two major concerns by focusing on regulation of a biological process of interest (e.g., lipid biosynthesis) in an organ specific manner (e.g., in seeds) and by estimating the likelihood of a given TF being redundant in its function (Aim 1). We will validate our functional predictions, using transgenic lines (Aim 2), via phenotypic assays (Aim 3a) and by identifying the specific target genes these TFs regulate (Aim 3b). Finally, we translate the validated TF regulation knowledge gained in a model species (Arabidopsis thaliana) to biofuel crops (e.g., Camelina sativa) (Aim 4). Outcome:This DOE project focuses on the seed lipid biosynthesis trait as a proof-of-concept and aims to identify multiple novel regulators of this trait. The data and algorithms developed in this project should prove valuable to any research group interested in discovering novel TF regulators of any plant process. This project provides the data and tools to discover such regulators in the model plant Arabidopsis as well as a computational pipeline to translate the knowledge gained in Arabidopsis to a biofuel species."

More than half of the population of the United States lives in coastal watershed counties or parishes, and generate 58% ($8.3 trillion) of the Nation’s GDP, even though they comprise only 25% of the Nation’s land area. Coastal communities and associated infrastructure are especially vulnerable to wind and flooding related damages due to tropical storms, hurricanes, and heavy rainfall events, which are increasing in frequency and intensity. The current coastal flooding predictive capability is limited by the inadequate representation of coastal processes in the Earth System Models (ESM), especially as they relate to coastal hazards, and by a lack of automated workflow for facilitating the two-way information transfer between experimentalists/domain experts and computational scientists. This research aims to develop a Digital Twin (DT) framework capable of combining, in near- and real time, a multitude of data, distributed and parallel computing resources, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) and Scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques, to greatly strengthen current coastal hazard prediction skills, improving flood preparedness and mitigation capabilities. Objectives and Metholody: The scientific context will be studied on a computational framework of a high-performance, distributed platform to bridge the gap between multiphysics simulations and knowledge discovery through AI/ML technologies (MuSiKAL). In particular, an automated, scientific AI/ML-enabled, knowledge-discovery workflow to connect experimentalists, computational scientists, and decision makers will be developed, improving the fidelity and merits of physics-informed ML models for localized forecasting and reducing the latency and uncertainty between data generation and decision making. A multi-pronged approach will be implemented. Specifically, under the MuSiKAL project, the project team will (a) couple the DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) with a high-resolution, multi-scale, multi-physics coastal circulation model (ADCIRC); (b) develop a scientific AI/ML-enabled (SciML) high-fidelity DT of the coupled ESM to reduce latency in flood prediction and mitigation planning; (c) develop scientific AI/ML-based data ingestion and web-based visual platforms to connect experimentalists and computing scientists for continuously ingesting in situ and satellite data using the DT; and finally (d) demonstrate the multifaceted capabilities and workflows of MuSiKAL using comprehensive datasets focusing on the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Hurricanes Harvey and Laura), with strong emphases on connecting multiple stakeholders to co-design data collection and co-analyze flood simulations, and on continuous model-data integration and continuous learning. Potential Impact: The MuSiKAL system will be demonstrated for the U.S. Gulf Coast, for which the project team has collectively amassed significant modeling expertise and data. The Gulf of Mexico coast along Texas/Louisiana/Mississippi are home to important U.S. energy hubs, but are also home to socially vulnerable populations. This proposed effort contributes to bringing science and knowledge discovery toward minimizing flood damage exposure, improving socioeconomic stability in the region. The physics-based models and Digital Twin capabilities will be tested for various historical use cases. For example, extensive model and experimental data exists for a number of historical hurricanes, including Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Laura. In addition, the project will build upon expertise in coastal atmospheric, and land-river-ocean modeling to demonstrate digital twin capabilities. The dynamic, data-driven coastal flood prediction capability will also be demonstrated for scenario-based use cases. These use cases include industrial facility mitigation damage, wetland protection, and environmental justice issues. The MuSiKAL project will make multiple meaningful contributions toward the DOE Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) Integrated Computational and Data Infrastructure (ICDI) program, in developing a scalable distributed data storage and management platform under the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reuse) principles, and in implementing a seamless model-driven DT platform to enable close collaborations between experimentalists and computational/computer science peers."
X-CELLENT: X-Compiler Extending LLVM for Enhanced Natural Translation,Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research,DE-SC0022268,"Campanoni, Simone",Simone.Campanoni@northwesternuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","X-CELLENT: X-Compiler Extending LLVM for Enhanced Natural Translation David August, Princeton University (Principal Investigator) Simone Campanoni, Northwestern University (Co-Principal Investigator) Michael Kruse, Argonne National Laboratory (Co-Principal Investigator) The objective of this work is to produce an open-source parallel-programming-model (PPM) translator called X-CELLENT (Cross-Compiler Extending LLVM for Enhanced NaturalTranslation). X-CELLENT will produce natural and high-performance translations among many PPMs, including OpenMP and CUDA. X-CELLENT’s PPM-neutral compiler core makes it easily extensible with additional PPMs and allows for awareness of other interfaces, including MPI to facilitate distributed-memory optimizations. Using the PIs' novel collaboration-based compiler technologies, X-CELLENT will automatically produce high-quality natural translations even when target-appropriate parallelism is not present in the source. While X-CELLENT will work on unmodified source codes, this same technology will help X-CELLENT initiate lightweight programmer interactions only when doing so is likely to significantly improve output code quality, such as when the source program obscures the programmer’s true intentions. X-CELLENT will significantly reduce costs associated with creating, optimizing, and maintaining portable HPC codes. While the parallelism expressed in the source program is sufficient in some translations, it is often not appropriate for the target PPM (e.g., not sufficiently fine-grained). X-CELLENT meets this challenge with a deep understanding of the input program semantics and using these semantics to emit code with target-appropriate parallelism. Reliably and robustly finding target-appropriate parallelism is beyond the capabilities of existing compiler architectures. To address this problem, X-CELLENT leverages the power of the PIs' recent collaborative compiler technologies. For memory analysis, for example, recent collaboration technology disproves 20% more dependencies than the same state-of-the-art collection of memory analyses without it. Likewise, the PIs' collaborative transformation technology enables the compiler to reach previously unavailable results. In this project, collaboration makes finding target-appropriate parallelism much more likely. The heart of X-CELLENT is the Parallel Structure Program Dependence Graph (PS-PDG), an intermediate representation extending the program dependence graph (PDG) with a small set of primitives capable of representing features from a wide variety of PPMs. X-CELLENT first lowers input programs to the PS-PDG through the use of several components: The Extractor encodes the explicit parallelism and other semantics present in source programs in the PS-PDG. The Artifact Mapper annotates the PS-PDG with the original program’s artifacts, such as variable names and program structure, to enhance natural human readability in the generated target program. Then, the PIs' speculative Collaborative Analysis Framework (SCAF) removes many remaining dependencies from the PS-PDG. Leveraging the resulting high-precision PS-PDG, the PIs' Collaborative Parallelizer directs transformations to work together to find the target-appropriate parallelism necessary for an efficient result. A user-provided Configuration expresses the relative importance of naturalness, input resemblance, performance, and other considerations, such as those related to the treatment of floating-point operations.

X-CELLENT: X-Compiler Extending LLVM for Enhanced Natural Translation,Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research,DE-SC0022138,"August, David",David.August@thetrusteesofprincetonuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","The objective of this work is to produce an open-source parallel-programming-model (PPM) translator called X-CELLENT (Cross-Compiler Extending LLVM for Enhanced NaturalTranslation). X-CELLENT will produce natural and high-performance translations among many PPMs, including OpenMP and CUDA. X-CELLENT’s PPM-neutral compiler core makes it easily extensible with additional PPMs and allows for awareness of other interfaces, including MPI to facilitate distributed-memory optimizations. Using the PIs' novel collaboration-based compiler technologies, X-CELLENT will automatically produce high-quality natural translations even when target-appropriate parallelism is not present in the source. While X-CELLENT will work on unmodified source codes, this same technology will help X-CELLENT initiate lightweight programmer interactions only when doing so is likely to significantly improve output code quality, such as when the source program obscures the programmer’s true intentions. X-CELLENT will significantly reduce costs associated with creating, optimizing, and maintaining portable HPC codes. While the parallelism expressed in the source program is sufficient in some translations, it is often not appropriate for the target PPM (e.g., not sufficiently fine-grained). X-CELLENT meets this challenge with a deep understanding of the input program semantics and using these semantics to emit code with target-appropriate parallelism. Reliably and robustly finding target-appropriate parallelism is beyond the capabilities of existing compiler architectures. To address this problem, X-CELLENT leverages the power of the PIs' recent collaborative compiler technologies. For memory analysis, for example, recent collaboration technology disproves 20% more dependencies than the same state-of-the-art collection of memory analyses without it. Likewise, the PIs' collaborative transformation technology enables the compiler to reach previously unavailable results. In this project, collaboration makes finding target-appropriate parallelism much more likely. The heart of X-CELLENT is the Parallel Structure Program Dependence Graph (PS-PDG), an intermediate representation extending the program dependence graph (PDG) with a small set of primitives capable of representing features from a wide variety of PPMs. X-CELLENT first lowers input programs to the PS-PDG through the use of several components: The Extractor encodes the explicit parallelism and other semantics present in source programs in the PS-PDG. The Artifact Mapper annotates the PS-PDG with the original program’s artifacts, such as variable names and program structure, to enhance natural human readability in the generated target program. Then, the PIs' speculative Collaborative Analysis Framework (SCAF) removes many remaining dependencies from the PS-PDG. Leveraging the resulting high-precision PS-PDG, the PIs' Collaborative Parallelizer directs transformations to work together to find the target-appropriate parallelism necessary for an efficient result. A user-provided Configuration expresses the relative importance of naturalness, input resemblance, performance, and other considerations, such as those related to the treatment of floating-point operations. X-CELLENT will almost completely negate the costs associated with manual PPM translation. X-CELLENT’s bidirectionality and PPM-independent PS-PDG create new options for maintaining programs expressed using multiple PPMs. X-CELLENT’s ability to find target-appropriate parallelism will help programmers write efficient parallel programs from the start.

Closing the gap on understudied aerosol-climate processes in the rapidly changing central Arctic,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022046,"Creamean, Jessie",Jessie.Creamean@coloradostateuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","The accelerated rate of warming in the Arctic is of great concern due to impacts that include thawing permafrost, melting glacial ice, and declining sea ice cover. These processes contribute to amplified warming that affects climate globally. Aerosols, clouds, and fog play a crucial role in regulating sunlight and heat reaching frozen surfaces, but the magnitude of their effects on surface temperature is not well constrained, especially in the central Arctic directly over the sea ice. In addition to directly interacting with radiation, aerosols can serve as seeds or nuclei for cloud formation and alter cloud properties, but even less is known about their impacts and origins. Specifically, aerosols from local pollution, open water including leads and melt ponds, and the snow-covered sea ice surface remain poorly understood, yet could have significant impacts on cloud nuclei concentrations, and thus, central Arctic cloud and fog formation. In order to assess aerosol impacts on clouds and the surface energy budget over the rapidly-shrinking sea ice, collaborative analyses of observations in the central Arctic over the entire annual cycle are essential, particularly given seasonal changes in air mass transport, sunlight, clouds, and sea ice extent. The 2019 – 2020 Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) campaign in the provides the unique opportunity to reduce critical knowledge gaps in central Arctic aerosol sources and processes. The overarching objective of the proposed work is to assess understudied aerosol processes associated with aerosol composition and cloud/fog formation in the central Arctic. We will build upon and leverage existing efforts and resources dedicated to measurements of aerosols during MOSAiC. We will focus on processes with the potential for significant impacts on Arctic aerosol composition and clouds, but that have remarkably limited observational understanding in this region, including: (1) aerosols generated from and transformed by ship pollution, (2) emission processes and abundance of coarse-mode aerosol from natural sources (i.e., aerosols greater than 1 µm in diameter), and (3) interactions between aerosols and Arctic fog. Specifically, we frame these as the following scientific research questions we intend to address: RQ1: What is the evolution and dispersion of ship-based pollution under various atmospheric states in the central Arctic, and how much might it contribute to cloud formation? RQ2: What are the mechanisms for coarse aerosol generation, including sea salt, biological particles, and dust, and are these important for central Arctic cloud formation? RQ3: What are the dominant sources of aerosols that facilitate central Arctic fog formation, and how does aerosol composition change during Arctic fog? The proposed collaborative work involves the use of: (1) existing aerosol, meteorological, oceanographic, and sea ice observations that were collected in real time; (2) existing aerosol data from offline analyses of a subset of discrete aerosol samples collected during the expedition; and (3) new data from additional analyses of aerosol, seawater, sea ice, and snow samples to fill in observational gaps and focus on case studies. By addressing our first research question, we will refine the characterization of ship-based aerosol pollution and gain insights into the impacts of increasing Arctic shipping due to diminishing sea ice. Addressing our second research question will enable a detailed account of coarse aerosol sources and emission mechanisms, which are critical to the population of aerosols that can serve as seeds for cloud ice crystal formation. Our third research question is imperative to answer since central Arctic fog formation and persistence is poorly understood yet could have significant impacts on the energy balance at the sea ice surface. The proposed work involves three female principal investigators (two early-career, one mid-career) and three graduate students contributing to this international collaboration. Overall, the proposed project will enable us to address key scientific Arctic aerosol-cloud questions to better understand the Arctic system science through a holistic approach."

Furthermore, understanding and quantifying the chemical mechanisms during catalytic reactions will be necessary to optimize catalyst performance. This project focuses on an emerging class of catalysts, atomically precise metal nanoclusters, which are small nanoparticles that can be produced with precisely known chemical formulas and structures. These nanoclusters combine many of the advantages of nanoparticle catalysts, particularly exposure of reactive metal surface sites, with those of molecular catalysts, namely tailorable atomic geometries and the ability to produce the exact same catalysts in bulk quantities. Fully harnessing these advantages could lead to catalysts that require less energy input, form fewer byproducts, or enable new chemical transformations. Despite these advantages, progress on nanocluster catalysts has been hampered by a lack of understanding, or even direct experimental probes, of the catalytic mechanisms underlying their reactivity. This project aims to determine the mechanisms underlying key elementary reactions involved in electrocatalytic reduction and oxidation reactions with nanocluster catalysts. Using the unique capabilities of gas phase cluster chemistry techniques, the team will form and isolate elusive catalytic nanocluster-reactant complexes and probe the extent to which they activate small molecules such as CO2 and the structures of intermediates involved in the reaction. The extent of activation will be tracked as the composition of the nanocluster is varied, elucidating the specific form of the cluster and the cluster-molecule interactions driving reactivity. These insights will be used to guide new efforts to precisely engineer more active sites on model catalytic nanoclusters. These studies will yield improved mechanistic models for efforts to develop more active nanocluster catalysts for a variety of reactions, identify potentially more active nanocluster compositions, and clear examples of successful approaches to engineering active sites, all of which will be necessary to optimize and deploy nanoclusters as effective catalysts."
Advancing the Understanding of Cloud Microphysical Processes and Aerosol Indirect Effects in High-Latitude Mixed-Phase Clouds by Linking ARM Measurements with Climate Model Simulations,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021211,"Diao, Minghui",Minghui.Diao@sanjosestateuniversityresearchfoundation,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Advancing the Understanding of Cloud Microphysical Processes and Aerosol Indirect Effects in High-Latitude Mixed-Phase Clouds by Linking ARM Measurements with Climate Model Simulations Minghui Diao, San Jose State University (Principal Investigator) Xiaohong Liu, Texas A&M University (Co-Investigator) The key objectives of this proposal are to advance our understanding of cloud microphysical characteristics and aerosol indirect effects on mixed-phase clouds in the high latitudes. To improve the representation of ice and mixed-phase clouds in global climate models (GCMs), we propose an integrated observation and modeling study of cloud macro- and microphysical properties, including spatial heterogeneities, mass partitioning between ice crystals and supercooled liquid water, effects of ice nucleating particles (INPs), and efficiency of secondary ice production (SIP), etc. Specifically, we will take four main approaches in this proposed work: (1) examining macro- and microphysical properties of ice and mixed-phase clouds based on in-situ and ground-based observations from multiple field campaigns funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program, including the Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (M-PACE), Indirect and Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign (ISDAC), Ice Nucleating Particle Sources at Oliktok Point (INPOP), ARM West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE), Measurements of Aerosols, Radiation, and Clouds over the Southern Ocean (MARCUS), and Macquarie Island Cloud and Radiation Experiment (MICRE); (2) evaluating DOE Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) simulations based on observations, particularly for ice and mixed-phase cloud microphysical properties; (3) examining the impacts of INPs on ice and mixed-phase clouds. Specifically, hemispheric comparisons will be conducted between northern and southern high latitudes using observations over the Arctic, the Southern Ocean and the Antarctica. In addition, aerosol indirect effects from distinct sources of dust particles will be examined; and (4) investigating the impacts of SIP. Ultimately, these tasks will help to improve cloud microphysics and aerosol-cloud interaction parameterizations in the E3SM model. The resulting analysis will provide an improved physical basis for refining the current cloud parameterizations in the ice and mixed-phase cloud regime in E3SM. We will run the E3SM model in the weather forecast mode through the DOE Cloud-Associated Parameterizations Testbed (CAPT) and in the single-column mode. In particular, we will develop a method in order to compare high-resolution aircraft observations with coarse-resolution climate model simulations. Impacts of spatial and temporal scales will be investigated in the model-observation comparison. The statistical probability density functions (PDFs) of modeled cloud microphysical properties will be examined in relation to thermodynamic, dynamical and aerosol conditions. We will utilize a dust source-tagging capability in E3SM to explicitly track dust from various sources. This will provide insights into the relative importance of local dust source versus long-range transported dust from low-latitude sources to INPs in the Arctic. We will also examine the relative importance of dust versus marine organic aerosols contributed to the INPs over the Southern Ocean. The indirect effects of distinct sources of INPs on mixed-phase clouds at high latitudes will be quantified with E3SM constrained by observations of INPs and cloud microphysical properties. Effects of SIP on mixed-phase cloud properties with respect to primary ice nucleation will be examined with E3SM, in comparison with observational analyses of ice crystal and INP number concentrations and associated thermodynamic and dynamical conditions. Different SIP mechanisms (e.g., rime splintering, ice-ice collision fragmentation, and droplet shattering during freezing) will be compared for their impacts on mixed-phase cloud properties using E3SM."

Kidambi, Assistant Professor Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Vanderbilt University Nashville, Tennessee, 37212 Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials present new opportunities for advancing separation of isotopes and light elements with minor atomic number (Z) differences. The pristine lattice of graphene and h-BN is impermeable to Helium atoms but allows for permeation of sub-atomic species i.e. electrons, protons and its isotopes. The introduction of precise sub-nanometer defects/pores into the 2D lattice can significantly enhance transport of sub-atomic species and enable practical separations of interest to national security, energy generation and conversion, as well as environmental remediation/de-contamination efforts. A detailed fundamental understanding of the transport characteristics of isotopes and light elements with minor Z differences through sub-nanometer defects/pores in 2D materials is hence imperative but remains elusive. The proposed research aims to develop new experimental approaches to study and elucidate transport characteristics of isotopes and light elements with minor Z differences through sub-nanometer pores in the 2D lattice. Outcomes of the proposed research are anticipated to include i) fundamental insights into transport characteristics of isotopes and light elements with minor Z differences, ii) novel approaches to increase isotope selectivity of 2D membranes, and iii) new knowledge on the development of atomically thin membranes for isotope separations, furthering the Department of Energy Isotope Program mission to “conduct R&D on new and improved isotope production and processing technologies that can make available isotopes for essential research and applications.”"

However, despite the large increase in the number of new materials reported each year, synthesis is often guesswork driven, characterization is slow and labor intensive, and there are few computational tools available to predict new, high-impact materials. The proliferation of new materials has far outstripped characterization capabilities, and discovery rather than design remains the primary route to new useful compounds. Crystallographic characterization is a bottleneck because new materials can take months to years to screen. Until today, there are few options for acceleration in either area that enable us to leverage the capabilities of machine learning and AI tools, and there are no existing automated tools for systematic design of materials with novel geometries at the atomic scale. This proposal aims to use crystal engineering of hybrid coordination polymers towards achieving rational control over the optoelectronic properties of low-dimensional nanostructures by leveraging molecular geometry and intermolecular forces in a covalently associated supramolecular assembly. This program is likely to reach a broad swath of the scientific community with our collaborative efforts. The primary objective of this integrated research program is to streamline the design, synthesis, and characterization of new materials. We will create infrastructure that will solve - these fundamental challenges and yield systematic tools for real-time characterization of materials from >100tb datasets and simulation and design of new compounds. We seek to achieve this objective by combining state-of-the-art Euclidean neural networks (ENN), rapid nano-crystallographic characterization, and a continuously variable synthetic system to train machine learning algorithms to predict new phases of materials. While structure prediction algorithms fueled by genetic algorithms (e.g., USPEX) are successful at generating new geometries, they cannot learn relationships between geometries or tunable parameters which can be used to interpolate between atomic geometries. Current approaches to structural refinement from serial diffraction data require a domain expert to iteratively solve for the structure by integrating prior knowledge. Thus, high-confidence structural insights can only be delivered post-beamtime. We propose to use Euclidean neural networks to aid in both synthesis through the generation of new atomic geometries conditioned on desirable properties and the refinement process to characterize the results of ML-guided synthetic searches. Euclidean neural networks are ideal for both of these tasks because they can naturally handle 3D geometry, can readily learn efficient and accurate surrogate models of physical processes, and can be extended to naturally handle scattering data in reciprocal space. We will build and demonstrate these methods on the use case of designing and synthesizing hybrid quantum nano materials that are readily synthesizable and are structurally characterized using serial crystallography from XFEL, synchrotron, and Micro Electron Diffraction (MicroED) sources."
Systems biology to enable modular metabolic engineering of fatty acid production in cyanobacteria,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022207,"Young, Jamey",Jamey.Young@vanderbiltuniversity,"['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","Cyanobacteria are attractive hosts for biomanufacturing because of their ability to rapidly fix CO2, grow in nutrient-poor environments, and produce renewable chemicals directly from photosynthesis. Despite these advantages, the product titers achieved by cyanobacteria are currently much lower than from heterotrophic organisms, and few tools are available for redirecting or enhancing metabolic fluxes to bioproducts in cyanobacteria. Lipid-based products that can be converted to biodiesel or other oleochemicals represent one of the most promising platforms for petrochemicals replacement. Unlike triacylglycerol production in green algae, production of free fatty acids (FFAs) using genetically engineered cyanobacteria results in secretion of the product into the culture medium where it can be efficiently recovered. However, there is a major gap in our understanding of how lipid metabolism is regulated in cyanobacteria that limits our ability to rationally engineer high-titer FFA production in cyanobacterial hosts. The long-term goal of this research is to develop strains of cyanobacteria that are optimized for producing renewable chemicals at commercially feasible rates and titers. The overall objective of the current project is to use systems biology approaches to identify metabolic control points and bottlenecks that regulate flux to FFA products in cyanobacteria. Our central hypothesis is that cyanobacterial lipid metabolism can be modularized into pathways that are “upstream” and “downstream” of the nodal metabolite acetyl-CoA, which can be separately studied and optimized to enhance overall FFA production. We will apply a suite of systems biology approaches including 13C flux analysis, metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, and CRISPRi screens to rigorously define the regulation of flux within each module. As proof of principle, this modular approach will be applied to optimize cyanobacterial production of FFAs in the fast-growing, halotolerant strain Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002. However, we expect our research findings will be generalizable to other cyanobacterial species and additional bioproducts derived from acetyl-CoA. The rationale for the proposed research is that a deeper understanding of how fatty acid flux is regulated upstream and downstream of acetyl-CoA will enable integrated “push-pull” metabolic engineering strategies to produce lipid products directly from photosynthetic CO2 fixation in cyanobacteria. The proposed research is potentially transformative because it will provide a roadmap for leveraging modern systems biology approaches toward a modular strain engineering pipeline. This work will have an important positive impact by providing new technologies to accelerate the development of host strains for photosynthetic bioprocesses. In addition, it will provide fundamental insights into how metabolic flux is natively regulated in cyanobacteria and how it can be efficiently redirected into synthetic bioproducts. This research will directly contribute to DOE’s mission by advancing toward biological production of renewable fuels that do not compete with agriculture."

Predictions of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in tidal wetlands are highly uncertain. Eddy covariance (EC) towers provide ecosystem-scale GHG flux data at a temporal resolution (every 30min) that is helpful for parameterizing and improving mechanistic realism in ESMs. We propose to use a network of eddy covariance towers and standardized ancillary data streams, along with mesocosm experiments and statistical analyses, across diverse tidal wetlands of North America to develop and improve biogeochemical modeling at the TAI. Our overarching objective is to improve understanding and process-based modeling of gross primary productivity (GPP) and CH4 emission responses, both non-linear and asynchronous, to stressors including plant inundation, disturbance, salinity and nitrogen loading. Observational and Experimental Measurements and Analyses Our network of 7 eddy covariance towers will measure net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and CH4 along with critical ancillary variables including water table height, plant inundation, porewater and tidal channel salinity and nitrate, and soil respiration measurements. First, we will develop new algorithms for partitioning net ecosystem exchange measurements of CO2 (NEE) into GPP and ecosystem respiration (Reco) and validate the new algorithms using stable isotope partitioning. Using the flux and ancillary data streams across the tower network, we will use statistical analyses (i.e. piecewise regressions, wavelets and information theory) to identify thresholds and lag responses between GPP and CH4 emissions and changes in plant inundation, salinity and nitrate across multiple temporal scales (e.g. diel-interannual). Thresholds and non-linear or asynchronous responses detected in statistical analyses will be targeted using mesocosm experiments where inundation, salinity and nitrate pulses will be studied under controlled conditions. Biogeochemical Model Development The observational and experimental data and statistical analyses will be used to inform model structural improvements of a tidal wetland biogeochemical model MEM-PEPRMT. MEM-PEPRMT will be parameterized using a Model-Data Fusion approach. The CH4 submodule of MEM-PEPRMT will be compared with a machine learning model built using CH4 emission data. MEM-PEPRMT model performance will be evaluated against the validation dataset (a subset of sites not included in model parameterization) and the machine learning model. Finally, the improved MEM-PEPRMT model will be compared with PFLOTRAN-E3SM at an independent site in the Chesapeake Bay, an ESM that has recently been adapted for improved performance in tidal wetlands. This comparison will help inform how model structure and structural error in ESMs can be improved and quantified, respectively. Our research will improve predictive modeling of GPP and CH4 by ESMs in tidal marshes, a critical but poorly constrained TAI that plays a disproportionately large role in soil carbon storage."

Cellulose fermenting, anaerobic bacteria show great promise for this task, however, engineering them for high titer product formation has proven challenging. This is due to several distinctive aspects of their metabolism. First, their glycolytic pathway differs from canonical glycolysis at several key steps, including phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, suggesting substantial differences in regulation which interfere with both engineering and modeling efforts. Second, data sets with diverse metabolic fluxes are needed to parameterize kinetic models. In cellulolytic anaerobes, their limited substrate range (generally restricted to cellulose and its hydrolysis products) and reliance on EMP glycolysis prevent the generation of these datasets by either gene deletions or feeding with different substrates, as is commonly done in model organisms. We will address the first obstacle by purifying and characterizing enzymes in C. thermocellum central metabolism (Aim 1). Identifying regulators is necessary to formulate accurate rate laws. We will do this by testing a range of regulators predicted by our multi-scale kinetic model (Aim 3). We will address the second obstacle by characterizing metabolism using a cell lysate system, where diverse flux distributions can be generated by feeding the lysate with non-physiological intermediate metabolites and perturbing with heterologous enzymes (Aim 2). The data generated from these experiments will be used to improve our systems-level understanding of C. thermocellum metabolism using a novel multi-scale kinetic modeling approach (Aim 3). This improved understanding will be demonstrated by producing 2,3-butanediol from cellulose in vivo (Aim 4).The primary impact of this work will be an improved systems-level understanding of central metabolism in C. thermocellum, a representative of the cellulolytic anaerobes, thereby informing use of this group of organisms as a platform for production of fuels and chemicals from lignocellulose. Demonstrating the utility of lysate-based cell-free systems for studying metabolism will lay the foundation for a new systems biology workflow, responsive to the unique features of emerging model organisms."

For high-resolution models, these long timescales make it computationally infeasible to spin-up the biogeochemical components of Earth-system models (ESMs) by simply time-stepping them forward until transients die out. As a result, ESMs typically experience a drift for the first several hundred to thousand years of simulation as the oceans adjust to the surface forcing and the soil carbon and nutrient pools adjust to the drifting climate. Furthermore, biogeochemical modules in ESMs have many parameters that are calibrated by “fitting” the model to observations rather than from first principles. The biogeochemistry initialization problem therefore consists of finding a consistent set of parameters and biogeochemical state variables that minimize model drift and mismatch of the resulting model state with a sparse and noisy observational database. Here we propose to address this problem by: (1) fully implementing Newton-Krylov spin-up methods to the marine biogeochemical module (MARBL) in an offline approach using tracer-transport operators derived from Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)’s ocean component (MPAS-O), (2) extend the application of Newton- Krylov spin-up techniques to E3SM’s land model (ELM), (3) develop the computational infrastructure needed for an online spin-up of MARBL and ELM that is integrated with the Common Infrastructure for Modeling the EARTH (CIME), and (4) generate a fully coupled initial state for the Earth’s carbon cycle. Previous efforts with Newton-Krylov based solvers for spinning up ocean tracers have been applied to O(100km) grid resolution and obtained orders of magnitude acceleration of spin-up times. Some aspects that will need to be addressed are the impact of internally generated variability (e.g. mesoscale eddies) on the definition of cyclo-stationarity and the impacts of finer grid resolution on the design of the preconditioner for the Krylov solver portion of the method. In addition to addressing these research topics, we will build on the recent development of cyclo-stationary solvers for the planetary-geostrophic equations to explore the extension of Newton- Kryolv techniques to dynamically active temperature and salinity tracers in MPAS-O."

Nevertheless, it is typically very challenging to extract physical predictions from a given QFT. Conventional methods only apply when the QFT is weakly coupled (i.e. essentially non-interacting), while many QFTs of interest are strongly coupled and thus not amenable to these approaches. The primary goal of this research is the development and application of new tools for analyzing strongly coupled QFTs. These tools are based on different notions of symmetries, which can be used to simplify QFT problems even in the strong-coupling regime. Supersymmetry (SUSY) plays a particularly important role in this research. While SUSY QFTs often arise in the context of string theory or particle physics beyond the Standard Model, this research uses them as a fruitful theoretical laboratory for exploring QFTs at strong coupling."

In particular, active control of the current profile, together with appropriate rotation and pressure profile control, has been demonstrated to be a key condition for the realization and sustainment of advanced plasma scenarios characterized by improved confinement, enhanced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability, and possible steady-state operation. The control of the plasma spatial profiles arises as one of the most challenging control problems due to the high dimensionality and nonlinearity exhibited by the burning plasma. A model-based approach emerges as the only possible way of tackling this challenging, nonlinear, high-dimensional, control-design problem, while enabling control integration, actuator sharing, real-time optimization, and MHD-instability avoidance. The Lehigh University (LU) Plasma Control Group (PCG) has pioneered many control-oriented modeling and control-design techniques for advanced scenario control, strongly impacting not only DIII-D but also major experiments around the world (techniques developed at DIII-D have been and are being extended to NSTX-U, EAST, KSTAR, and ITER). In spite of the significant progress achieved, a great deal of research work is still needed for these advanced-scenario control solutions to reach the level of completeness, integration, and reliability required for ITER and future fusion reactors.

The research extends optical nano-imaging into a new regime of imaging competing quantum dynamic processes in 2D layered materials through nano-optical control of the light matter interaction.

Instead, through purposeful active perturbation via tip nano-cavity Purcell enhancement, ultrashort pulse and strong field excitation, and nano-localized strain modulation, competing relaxation pathways will be separate and resolved that are otherwise difficult or impossible to disentangle. Through the combination of enhanced spatial, spectral, and temporally resolved nano-imaging, fundamental questions in 2D materials science in graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their heterostructures are addressed as the basis for their technological electronic and photonic applications. Specifically, in 2D superlattices of twisted multilayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), electron-phonon coupling, interlayer coupling, and exciton localization will be studied to address the origin of superconductivity and other emergent correlated phases in these materials. With the newly developed approach of pico-cavity clock nano-imaging, competing intra-, localized, and inter-layer exciton radiative and nonradiative dynamics will be resolved to extend the range of nano-photonic applications of TMDs.

Unfortunately, the development and testing of such application software now faces many serious productivity crises brought about by the increased use of heterogeneity. In practical terms, extreme heterogeneity implies the use of CPUs, GPUs and accelerators from different manufacturers, alternatives to traditional IEEE number representations, and compilers and numerical libraries that employ new instruction sets and computational units such as Tensor Cores. These changes have both fundamental and pervasive impact throughout the software stack. They affect the behavior of a number of aspects of today’s HPC software, throwing today’s software testing methods for HPC completely off-track. This proposal is on new testing methods that not only help restore order but stay relevant despite the continued growth of heterogeneity. The specific focus of our work is on numerical correctness. In their quest to reduce data movement costs, designers of modern HPC systems have embraced different lower precision arithmetic schemes that are supported by a plethora of computing substrates and compilers. Amidst these flurry of changes, even a simple step such as a compiler upgrade can cause significant ripple effects in terms of numerical result aberrations. Often, expert human intervention is needed to repair the situation. Work in the ComPort project will approach these challenges under four thrusts. The first, Testing for Reusable and Composable Software Development, will develop component interface characterization methods that lead to testing efficiency. Work under this thrust will not only enhance the coverage of all important facets of a components’ behavior but also avoid wasting testing cycles by repeatedly covering scenarios previously seen. Testing for Portability and Automation-assistance is the second thrust of ComPort. Upon encountering numerical errors, a number of correction strategies must be manually employed: changing the compiler optimization flags; using extra precision (deduced through manual reasoning) for selected variables; and even selective rewrite of code to real-number equivalent alternate forms that help lower the rounding error. This thrust will explore methods to automatically carry out such repairs. It will also develop methods to ensure numerical correctness portability when performance portability frameworks such as Kokkos and RAJA are employed. Testing/Monitoring for Inputs and Runtime Behavior is the third thrust of ComPort. Software components have long lives, and hence must be adjusted over time to operate under different circumstances. Not only have the parallel programming models become richer, the components may be subject to new input ranges, and may be run on hardware whose specifications also evolve over time. Testing methods must stay nimble to these changes. Our work will employ various runtime monitoring methods both to detect the onset of problems, and to glean facts (e.g., value intervals seen) that can be recorded in a components’ interface to help minimize test coverage duplication. Test Feedback and User Actionability is the fourth and final thrust of ComPort. Test management is a complex problem given the sheer number of parameters (problem sizes, machine parameters, problem parameters, runtime flag options, minibatch sizes, etc.) that fly about. We will automate the mining of relationships between these system parameters. When failures occur, we will provide higher-level feedback as well as enable high-level actionability. The research of this project will be carried out over three years through collaboration between universities and DOE labs. Its development will be driven by various Exascale Computing Proxy-Applications. At the end of three years, the ComPort testing framework will be demonstrated on two non-trivial actual applications. Publications and student/postdoc training will be additional outcomes in addition to the release of versions of ComPort after each of the three years."

This project applies an adaptive materials design concept based on materials informatics to incorporate data-driven multiscale modeling capable of predicting and optimizing the morphology-property relationships. The approach integrates data science, machine learning (ML), multiscale modeling/simulation, and experimentation. Synthesis of new membrane systems are guided by the adaptive materials design concept, which includes identification of additional descriptors/features from experiments and simulations in order to improve predictability and uncertainty quantification with each iteration. Simulations include multiscale models for ion transport in heterogeneous electrolyte materials with phase-separated morphology, including a data-driven approach for morphology optimization based on phase field models for the functional electrode membrane. Specifically, ab initio dynamics of OH¯ and electronic structure calculations are performed for molecular models of polyelectrolytes. This elucidates system-specific mechanisms of charge transport, obtains parameters and descriptors for the ML models and for the phase field model of ion transport. The model for ion transport in the functional electrode membrane is derived from nonequilibrium thermodynamic theories, and couples temperature, electric field, multispecies ions, polymer phases and solvent effects. It is calibrated using the data coming from atomic level simulations as well as from experimentation. Optimization of the morphology for targeted ion transport properties in the multiphasic membrane material will be carried out for rational design of the electrode materials. Expected outcomes include (i) a copolymer-based functional electrode membrane material with superior properties; (ii) expanded knowledge of ion transport in multiscale, heterogeneous material systems; and (iii) an adaptive materials design toolset/protocol for establishing and optimizing morphology-relationships for such systems."

It focuses on the development and application of monochromated and in situ transmission electron microscopy techniques for photocatalytic materials used in water splitting. The research will focus on two main goals related to primary materials functionalities that are critical to development of improved photocatalysts. First, research team will investigate how surface functionalization can be employed to generate photoactive charges at the catalyst surface from visible light. Secondly, research will explore how resonant energy transfer or transduction processes can be employed to channel and direct photon energy directly to photoactive surface nanoparticles. To accomplish these goals the research team will tackle the following specific objectives: (A) Enhance visible-light absorption and charge separation at the surface, (B) Correlate changes in dynamic atomic and electronic surface structure with activity, (C) Sense quantum transduction in nanoparticle composite systems, and (D) Enhance photocatalysis using coherent resonant energy transfer. Objectives A and B tackle the first goal through an approach which functionalizes the surfaces of the catalysts with visible-light absorbers in the form of dopants or clusters. Objectives C and D actively attempt to channel the electromagnetic energy from the incoming photons directly to surface reaction centers. To achieve these objectives, the research team will manipulate the architectures of the composite photocatalytic systems and probe structure and functionality with advanced in situ imaging and spectroscopy techniques available in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with theoretical modeling.

(303) 210-0396; E-mail: murnane@jila.colorado.edu Ultrafast all-optical switching of magnetization is the least-dissipative and fastest method for magnetic writing. However, fully exploiting such capabilities for more energy-efficient technologies requires a detailed understanding of the underlying physics. At present, our understanding of spin systems is predominantly phenomenological: a comprehensive, self-consistent, microscopic model that rigorously includes the spin, electronic, photonic and phonon-degrees of freedom and their interactions does not yet exist. This understanding is fundamentally constrained by an ability to directly observe magnetism on all relevant time and length scales. While the fundamental length- and time-scales for magnetic phenomena are Å to nanometers (exchange length) and femtoseconds (exchange splitting), tools for accurately probing these scales have only recently become available. Ultrafast X-ray pulses make it possible to probe element-specific spin dynamics in multi-component magnetic systems, providing rich new information not accessible using visible light. In particular, tabletop, laser-based, high harmonic (HHG) sources are unique as a probe of magnetic dynamics since they can capture the fastest femtosecond and even attosecond spin dynamics in multiple elements (sites or layers) simultaneously. By combining HHG sources with new spectroscopic techniques, a series of new discoveries regarding the fastest spin dynamics in materials were possible. Light can transfer spin transfer spin polarization between two elements in an alloy, on few-fs timescales. The ultrafast magnetic phase transition in Ni is a true magnetic phase transition, that is launched within ~20fs. It is also possible to distinguish attosecond electron-electron scattering and screening. Using DOE facilities, new approaches for imaging 3D magnetic textures without any prior assumptions about the sample, and for capturing domain dynamics, were implemented. Several group alumni now work at DOE laboratories. The proposed research will take advantage of both tabletop HHG sources as well as DOE facilities. The fundamental mechanisms underlying the fastest light-induced spin manipulation in ferromagnetic materials, from single element, to Heusler alloys, to 2D materials with charge density wave order, will be studied. New characterization techniques will also be extended to antiferromagnetic systems and 3D dynamic spin textures, of great interest for quantum devices. The ability to create polarization and phase structured beams to enhance contrast and implement unique excitations and probes of magnetic materials will also be harnessed. This research is very relevant to DOE–– a fundamental understanding of spin manipulation and transport, as well as better and accurate characterization techniques, are all critical for the smart design of next-generation, energy-efficient classical and quantum nano devices. Moreover, ultralow-power, high-performance nonvolatile memory and logic devices based on magnetic spin (spintronics) are starting to make inroads into conventional computing and represent a prime candidate for practical quantum technologies."

The advantage of smaller reactors is in their faster and cheaper development. Although (RE)Ba2Cu3O7-x (REBCO) is the best performing and most mature HTS, it still suffers from two main technical challenges: protection from quench and conductor cost. Because of a much smaller normal zone propagation velocity, a normal zone in an HTS magnet generates a much larger peak electric field and thus a much higher peak temperature than in an LTS magnet. As a result, voltage-based systems are insufficient and put the magnets at risk. Additionally, voltage based detection can be compromised by electromagnetic (EM) noise. Which is an especially big problem in AC- operated fusion magnets and makes voltage based approaches completely ineffective. The current state of the art for quench detection in HTS systems is either no detection systems (unacceptable for large magnets) or voltage taps, which have been shown to be ineffective. The proposing team has been working on Rayleigh-backscattering Interrogated Optical Fibers (RIOF) for several years, and has shown numerous advantages of RIOF compared to voltage taps. Some of the advantages include immunity to electromagnetic noise, higher sensitivity to thermal and mechanical perturbation, smaller response time and higher spatial resolution (mm-range). Although the proposing team has shown that RIOF is a transformational method to solve the failure detection challenge in HTS magnets, fusion applications would greatly benefit from a RIOF technology that is able to distinguish strain from temperature variations. In response to this FOA, we partner with LUNA Innovations, manufacturer of the optical interrogator, to test the viability of a method to decouple strain from temperature variations at cryogenic temperatures. Additionally, the sensing characteristic and thermal sensitivity will be estimated at cryogenic temperatures with and without simultaneous presence of strain onto the optical fiber, thereby quantifying the effectiveness of the decoupling methods. Lastly, the additional computations needed to discriminate temperature and strain will be evaluated in terms of their impact on measurement speed and other sensing parameters."
The next generation of laser shock experiments on the LAPD,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021133,"Niemann, Christoph","Christoph.Niemann@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,losangeles","['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","We propose to leverage two major new facility upgrades at UCLA to perform the next round of laser shock experiments with a significantly improved parameter space. A new high-emissivity plasma source in the LAPD will increase the plasma density, while a new laser frontend will increase laser energy and on-target intensity, as well as add pulse-shaping capability. These upgrades are very favorable for dimensionless scaling parameters of relevance to shock-formation and will allow us to drive super-critical magnetosonic shocks with Alfvenic Mach numbers in excess of 4 for the first time. Experiments with a long train of laser pulses launching a sustained (several microseconds) yet super-Alfvenic plasma flow will allow novel solar- wind-tunnel style experiments for the first time. Based on numerical modeling, such extended plasma flows can drive resonant and non-resonant ion-instabilities in the LAPD to sufficiently large amplitudes to couple energy and momentum to the ambient plasma along the field for the first time. Collisionless shocks are objects of considerable interest in space- and astrophysical-plasmas due to their ability to accelerate high-energy cosmic rays, create spontaneous hot flow anomalies, and cyclically reform. The rapid progress in laser, plasma, and diagnostics capabilities is bringing the exploration of collisionless shocks into the realm of appropriately-scaled laboratory experiments, where the relevant microphysics can be probed directly in a controllable and reproducible manner. High-fidelity laboratory data is needed to validate numerical simulations, critical for understanding astrophysical shocks, and supporting space pro- grams. The experiment proposed here uniquely employs a high-power laser coupled to the LAPD to launch super-Alfvenic exploding plasmas into a 17 m long magnetized ambient plasma. Previous experiments have already produced weak magnetosonic shocks, and investigated the growth of ion-ion instabilities relevant for parallel shock formation. Here we propose to drive stronger shocks and larger amplitude waves over longer spatial scales, and measure their structure, evolution, and dissipation with more advanced diagnostics than were previously available. The project is of high scientific value as understanding the formation and evolution of collisionless shocks and the origin of cosmic rays represents a grand challenge in the plasma cosmos and the laboratory, and data are scarce. We will access a novel parameter regime in terms of Mach number and instability growth rates not previously accessible in the laboratory. The experiments are highly leveraged and take advantage of two existing experimental facilities that currently receive major upgrades. In contrast to other work elsewhere, the proposed experiments are large-scale, and the microphysics of shocks can be investigated with plasma probes with spatial resolution much better than an ion-inertial length. The proposed experiments open the possibility of studying space- and astro-physics in the laboratory and advance our understanding of the formation mechanisms of shocks, the generation of magnetic fields in the universe, and the partitioning of energy into various forms. The UCLA laser-shock experiments are performed entirely by graduate students. The proposed work bridges a gap between the basic plasma physics community and the high-energy density plasma community. Students will be exposed to both fields and will be trained on unique hands-on experiments. The proposed work will provide valuable input for the design of related shock experiments on larger facilities including NIF. The project will test a new type of driver for solar- wind-tunnel experiments, that employs sustained (microseconds) super-Alfvenic flows produced by a burst of laser pulses. This approach may open brand new opportunities for laboratory astrophysics experiments in general. Experiments will be compared to numerical models as well as to space data."

Symmetries have played and continue to play a central role in our understanding of the standard model of particle physics and beyond. This project investigates how symmetries constrain the form of the nucleon-nucleon interactions. In particular, it considers the symmetries that emerge when the number of colors Nc in QCD is taken to infinity. Significant constraints on the nucleon interactions emerge in this limit, and this project studies the internal consistency of this approach, with a particular emphasis on the role of Delta isobar states. Recent results suggest similarities between the large-Nc results and constraints obtained from quantum entanglement studies. Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum systems. Its role in nuclear physics is only now beginning to be explored in detail. This project investigates the connection between constraints obtained from quantum entanglement and those from the large-Nc approach. A better understanding of quantum entanglement has the potential to substantially improve the systematic description of the interactions between nucleons."
The role of subgrain heterogeneous processes in slip localization in polycrystalline metals during cyclic plasticity,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0018901,"Beyerlein, Irene","Irene.Beyerlein@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,santabarbara","['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","The overarching goal of this research program is to establish a fundamental understanding of how slip events develop in polycrystal microstructures and escalate to form fatigue cracks during cyclic loading. Fatigue of ductile polycrystalline metals is a microstructure-sensitive localization process, beginning with cyclic plasticity-driven production of substructural inhomogeneities and ending with the eventual development of cracks. While the failure mechanisms of materials under cyclic conditions have been studied extensively, designing a material for extended fatigue life is rarely performed based on knowledge of how instabilities first form and grow below the scale of the grain. Both experimental and computational studies have pointed to certain microstructural features, such as twin boundaries or non-transmissible grain boundaries, as possible damage sites; however, these descriptions have not been sufficiently discriminating for predictive microstructural design. The key remaining challenge lies in identifying when, where, why and how cyclic loading leads to the formation and intensification of rare but terminal material instabilities, such as slip localizations and cracks. Such fundamental knowledge would be foundational for physics-based microstructural design for increased fatigue and fracture resistance in materials for future energy technologies. The central hypothesis that drives this project is that the irreversible growth of intragranular lattice rotations and slip localizations during cyclic loading emerge from specific polycrystalline microstructural features. Research activities in all tasks will be driven to determine why some intragranular orientation gradients, formed during cyclic loading, “intensify” and become life-limiting structural slip localizations and to identify the combined microstructural and micromechanical characteristics at triple lines that provide high probability conditions for slip band formation. To address these questions, the program unites a suite of state-of-the-art experiments, High Energy X-ray Diffraction Microscopy (HEDM), Heaviside and High-Resolution Digital Image Correlation (H-DIC, HR-DIC), TriBeam tomography and 3D plasticity modeling techniques. Our approach constitutes a radical change in conventionally adopted fatigue analyses and aims to provide insight into how perfectly reversible macroscopic fatigue loading can grow rare but fatal, irreversible events. This project is for unclassified, fundamental research; as such, there should be no restrictions on the citizenship of those performing the work."

The chemistry of the actinide elements was first investigated in detail in the 1940’s during the Manhattan project and, although many decades have passed, we continue this investigation; now, however, using significantly more advanced instrumentation and synthetic capabilities. The underlying needs to study and understand actinide crystal chemistry have not significantly changed and continue to require the development of new actinide containing materials. The approach we are taking in this research program emphasizes the development and establishment of new synthetic approaches to enable us to prepare new actinide materials to study their properties. Information on these new synthetic routes and prepared new materials will be disseminated via publications so that others also can use them in their own research. The need for new materials to be used in new or existing applications continues to be a major driving force behind chemical research focused on improved understanding of chemical families and on the discovery of novel structure types and compositions with new or enhanced properties that can help or benefit the United States. The synthesis of such new materials often relies on new synthetic approaches that enable us to prepare new complex materials whose composition and hence their properties can be selectively modified to exhibit desirable physical behavior. To achieve these goals, we are developing advanced methods for the directed synthesis of new actinide oxides, fluorides and chalcogenides, either as powders or as single crystals, in order to determine the atomic structure of these materials, to investigate their electronic and magnetic properties, and to enable their utilization in a variety of applications. The three classes of materials that we will investigate, oxides, fluorides and chalcogenides, will enable us to tune the actinide material’s ionicity via the choice of anion that, in the case of uranium, will favor specific oxidation states as well as provide control over the expected electronic attributes of the targeted materials. In particular the investigation of actinide chalcogenides, the major thrust of the proposed work, will enable us to probe the decrease in the overall ionicity as we transition from oxides to sulfides to selenides to tellurides, progressing to enhanced metallicity that will accompany the steady change from localized and magnetic electronic states to more delocalized and, perhaps, itinerant electrons. Our recently developed Boron Chalcogenide Mixture (BCM) method for preparing oxygen free actinide chalcogenides will be a key factor for achieving these goals, as it greatly advances the synthesis of diverse classes of chalcogenides, especially actinide chalcogenides. Numerous novel uranium and thorium containing compositions will be synthesized for the first time and are expected to exhibit complex structures and, potentially, new or enhanced properties. Moreover, the ability to prepare these new materials as high quality single crystals is extremely desirable for crystal and magnetic structure determinations. The project will result in the training of graduate students to work safely with radioactive elements, and thereby help train the next generation of radiation workers. In addition, the extensive educational aspect of this research assures that highly trained men, women and underrepresented minorities will enter the workforce and meet industry’s need for scientists in STEM fields."

Among the most abundant polymers that are challenging to degrade are vinyl polymers and polyolefins. At the heart of their accumulation is the chemical challenge inherent in the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds that make up these polymer backbones. These bonds typically require such high temperatures (>350 °C) to be cleaved, that mixtures of products form, which further compounds the recycling problem. New strategies toward controlled breakdown of such polymers are urgently needed. To address this demand, the central objective of this project is to develop catalytic polymer modifications and skeletal rearrangements to enable the deconstruction of all- carbon polymer backbones. This project particularly focuses on diene polymers, which makes up a large proportion of commodity rubber materials and plastics but whose recycling remains an unsolved challenge. This project addresses this challenge in a three-pronged approach: (1) development of selenium-catalyzed C-H amination methods to install linchpin primary amine groups onto diene polymers, (2) investigation of the 2-aza-Cope rearrangement (ACR) to catalyze the conversion of model polymers with homoallylic amines with into value-added small-molecule amines, and (3) the combination of C-H amination and ACR to depolymerize diene rubber materials. The proposed work will shed light on critical catalyst design consideration that will advance the application of catalytic C-H functionalization and 2-aza-Cope rearrangements to polymeric substrates. More specifically, if successful, the proposed research will transform rubber waste into a feedstock material for valuable small molecule amines, which could be utilized as building blocks for functional materials. Furthermore, the proposed research will advance plastic sustainability in general by introducing a new strategy-namely, skeletal rearrangements-for the upcycling of recalcitrant polymer backbones."

The recent success of the MagLIF concept is one example of how magnetization is changing the direction of HEDP, as is the subsequent study of the magnetization of Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) capsule implosions to relax the ignition constraints. To understand the underlying physics of magneto-inertial confinement fusion, it is important to investigate the magnetized heat transport and extended Magneto-Hydrodynamic (MHD) effects using MHD codes. Simulation results need to be carefully compared with experiments. This warrants experiments to study the effect of a strong magnetic field on implosions and validation with models. In addition, the interpretation of spectral emission measurements from complex magnetized experiments requires novel and accurate modeling of the detailed atomic and radiation transport physics. At the OMEGA facility, a mini-MagLIF configuration seeks to scale the Z-machine’s platform with a seed magnetic field (B0 ~ 10-25 T) produced by the external pulsed-power system MIFEDS, coupled to a cylindrically laser-driven compressed target. For an initial B-field > 20 T, simulations predict compressed B-field values at maximum compression largely exceeding 10 kT over the entire compressed core. At this level of magnetic field, the magnetic pressure exceeds the thermal pressure, which on one hand lowers the assembled core density, but on the other hand drastically increases its temperature via magnetic heat insulation. The core becomes heavily magnetized, consequently driving a myriad of phenomena, such as Ohmic dissipation, current-driven transport, and suppression of instabilities by magnetic tension. For instance, simulations show that a magnetized plasma regime characterized by large induced electrical currents containing a significant proportion of the implosion energy is attainable. In addition, the compression of the B-field changes the hydrodynamic behavior and produces significant variations in the core temperature and density throughout the implosion collapse. Carrying out such magnetized implosion experiments will advance the modeling of B-field compression and diffusion, as well as atomic kinetics and line shape calculations in magnetized plasmas relevant to complex ICF-related experiments with embedded B-fields. Large magnetic fields are also of scientific interest for laboratory astrophysics, for example for the study of white dwarfs and magnetized shocks, among others. We propose first to extend the mini-MagLIF platform at the OMEGA facility to reach high compressed magnetic fields in the core (>10 kT at maximum compression). To that purpose, we will increase the convergence ratio of the implosions. We will also explore the prospects of a relatively new technique to generate static seed magnetic fields using laser-induced currents, which are debris-free and potentially stronger than what can currently be achieved with pulsed-power devices. Importantly, the implosions will use Ar-doped gas-filled targets to diagnose the conditions of the implosion core via Ar K-shell spectroscopy. The comparison of measured spectra with our advanced atomic and radiation models will bring information about the changes in the hydrodynamic evolution and the associated magnetization level. Due to the limitation of the drive energy and the competition with the magnetic pressure, the compressed magnetic field will saturate at a maximum value of ~40 kT with the OMEGA-60 lasers. Therefore, we propose to scale up the platform to the National Ignition Facility to reach record magnetic fields up to ~100 kT, comparable to the magnetic fields in white dwarfs. In conclusion, we believe that our experimental, theoretical, and numerical efforts will improve the understanding and control of the kinetic and hydrodynamic processes in highly magnetized HED plasmas."

This approach provides an opportunity to fabricate unique heterostructures that display novel optical and electronic properties. This opportunity stems in part from the unique properties of the materials themselves, for example transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have a direct-gap band structure, meaning they interact strongly with light, for a single monolayer but become indirect for two or more layers. Furthermore because they are single monolayers, the interaction between carriers is greatly enhanced leading to strong interactions between carriers, starting with the extremely large electron-hole binding that creates room-temperature stable excitons, bound electron-hole pairs analogous to a hydrogen atom. Heterostructures can be fabricated using TMDCs that are analogous to those fabricated using traditional semiconductors, for example a double-quantum well, but they have unique properties due to the difference in dimensions and the stronger interactions. Beyond these straightforward extension of classic heterostructures, TMDC heterostructures have entirely new degree of freedom, the lattice twist angle, the results in unique structures such as moire superlattices. We will apply colinear multidimensional coherent spectroscopy, which allows the incident laser beams to be focused to a sufficiently small spot to selectively probe regions within the microscopic samples, to obtain information about TMDC heterostructures that are not available using other methods. At the most basic level, multidimensional coherent spectroscopy can determine if the excitonic resonances in the sample is homogeneously broadened or inhomogeneously broadened, even if the respective linewidths are similar, where inhomogeneous broadening typically arises from structural disorder or the presence of impurities. Indeed, there is evidence that moire superlattices are inhomogeneously broadened, although the origin and nature of the inhomogeneity is not known. Using multidimensional coherent spectroscopy, we will be able to determine the relative contributions of the different line-broadening mechanisms and if there is coherent or incoherent coupling between the underlying states. Beyond moire effects, we will be able to observe many-body induced coherent coupling between excitons in separate layer including the timescales over which the relevant many-body states evolve. We will also explore methods for combining MDCS with using an x-ray free electron laser as a probe of the lattice dynamics induced by electronic excitation. These results will give insight into the fundamental physics, properties and dynamics of electronic excitations, including intra-layer excitons, inter-layer excitons, and unbound electron-hole pairs. This insight will be critical to potential applications of TMDC heterostructures in optoelectronics."

A common and abundant type of soil microorganism that associates with the roots of live plants, known as ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), is often able to control the rate at which its plant host grows (i.e. how much CO2 the plant captures through photosynthesis) and the amount of nutrients and C that are released from soil (e.g., as CO2 respired to the atmosphere) during decomposition by microorganisms. The goal of our project is to identify the specific ways in which EMF control these large fluxes of C and nutrients through plants and soils in terrestrial ecosystems. There is some evidence that EMF control the transformation of C and nutrients in soil by interacting (e.g. supporting or inhibiting the activity of) free-living decomposer (i.e. saprotrophic) microbes (SAPs) in soil, but there remains an intense debate about the mechanism and magnitude of these interactions in natural ecosystems. In the proposed research, we aim to determine how the combination of soil resources, plant growth, and the species composition of soil microbial communities shape plant-EMF-SAP interactions and their impacts on terrestrial biogeochemistry. Plants provide carbon in the form of sugar to their EMF symbionts in exchange for soil nutrients like nitrogen (N). This could cause strong interactions among EMF and SAPs, but recent studies have shown that this C transfer is controlled by the genetic compatibility of plants and the EMF species present in soil. This means that the interactions among plants, EMF, and SAPs may be critically dependent on the species composition of soil microbial communities and the environmental factors that disrupt it. To understand plant-EMF-SAP interactions, our work leverages a model plant-EMF system: plants in the Pinaceae and their EMF symbionts in the genus Suillus. Suillus fungi and Pinus trees are a widespread ecological and economically important plant-EMF symbiosis. Our previous collaborative research with DOE national labs has generated full sequenced genomes of Pinus seedlings and their Suillus partners, which allow us to quantify biochemical networks of plant-EMF-SAP interactions under varying plant and soil resources in our proposed studies. To understand plant-EMF-SAP interactions effects on C and nutrient cycling, we are using a novel C3 plant - C4 soil system in the greenhouse that allows us to manipulate the presence of EMF and trace the downstream effect on plant and soil nutrient cycling. We plan to apply our experimental data from the model Suillus-Pinus system to develop and test a state-of-the-art ecosystem model (FUN-CORPSE). This model represents the impacts of plants, EMF, and SAPs on plant growth and soil CO2 emissions. Data on decomposition activity in soil, nutrient cycling, and soil CO2 emissions from our experiments will be used to create more mechanistically-accurate versions of FUN-CORPSE, including soils that harbor EMF species with varying levels of genetic compatibility to their host plant. Our FUN-CORPSE models will be compared to a large field dataset on soil microbial communities and biogeochemistry from the U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). This groundbreaking new continental-scale dataset includes standardized, repeated measurements of plants and soils that span major Pinaceae-Suillus dominated forest biomes across the U.S., allowing us to evaluate how environmental variation shapes plant-EMF-SAP interactions and ecosystem biogeochemistry. This multi-scale ecological approach to studying plant-microbial-soil interactions will shed new light on one of the most direct, universal biological controls on terrestrial biogeochemical cycling across ecosystems."
Relativistically Induced Transparency in Plasma,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020236,"Willingale, Louise",Louise.Willingale@regentsoftheuniversityofmichigan,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","The proposed research is an experimental investigation into the effects of a relativistic plasma electron population on the propagation of light. At relativistic intensities, electrons oscillate in the laser fields at speeds approaching the speed of light, and this heating increases the relativistic effective mass of the electrons. This enables relativistically induced transparency (RIT), allowing the light to propagate to higher densities that exceed the classical critical density. It has been demonstrated that RIT can produce some significant and intriguing effects: It affects ion acceleration from thin solid foils and near-critical density targets, high-energy electron acceleration at near-critical densities, produces an optical shuttering effect, and RIT has implications for the hole-boring fast ignition inertial confinement fusion concept. The first objective is to observe the transition of a target to RIT by characterizing the reflected and transmitted light and the generated hot electrons. The second objective is to investigate the effect of RIT on secondary processes, namely ion acceleration and x-ray generation. This work will also train the next generation of plasma physicists in a wide range of research skills. Experiments will be performed using the upgraded 500 TW Hercules high-intensity laser system at the University of Michigan. Follow up experiments on LaserNetUS facilities will be performed to validify the results at higher energy. Near-critical density targets will be created using ultrathin foils or structured targets. Information about the laser absorption into hot electrons can be gathered through characterization of the reflected and transmitted light and the generated hot electrons for various laser pulse and target conditions. Near-critical density plasmas would be created using a variety of targets including nano-films or low-density structured targets. A number of measurements and setups will be utilized to collect information to compare the RIT. Varying the pulse duration (and intensity regimes) will test predicted scalings and provide evidence for whether secondary effects such as ion motion and instabilities become significant to the dynamics. Primary diagnostic techniques would be to analyze the transmitted and reflected light using as suite of optical diagnostics to make polarization and energy measurements as well as a FROG diagnostic to investigate frequency shifts and pulse duration. Experimental results will be compared with particle-in-cell simulations to assist with the interpretation and understanding of the data and help develop theoretical models of the dynamics. The impact of this work will be to build a clearer picture of the coupled effects of relativistically induced transparency on the propagation of light and the transfer of energy into the electron population, so that in turn the effects on the secondary processes of interest can be better understood. This research will also provide an excellent foundation for future experiments in the soon-to-be-accessible QED-plasma regime with the 10 PW systems that are currently being commissioned where peak intensities will exceed 1023 Wcm-2. In addition to the complex relativistic plasma physics, significant non-linear quantum electrodynamics effects -- synchrotron gamma-ray photons emitted from electrons in the laser fields and multi-photon Breit-Wheeler pair production -- are expected to produce an exciting new ""QED-plasma"" regime to study. At these intensities, even solid aluminum would become relativistically transparent to the laser pulse and QED effects can dramatically change the expected behavior of the plasma. This highlights the importance of understanding RIT at the more modest intensities so that the community is prepared to fully embrace the potential of the anticipated complex physics with ever increasing laser intensities."
Experimental and Modeling Studies of Transport and Retention of Motile Microbes in Pore-Networks for Improved Prediction of Metal Bioremediation,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019437,"Parashar, Rishi","Rishi.Parashar@boardofregents,obo,nevadasystemofhighereducation(nshe)-desertresearchinstitute","['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Experimental and Modeling Studies of Transport and Retention of Motile Microbes in Pore-Networks for Improved Prediction of Metal Bioremediation Rishi Parashar, Desert Research Institute Groundwater supplies in several places can get contaminated by various pollutants including heavy metals and radionuclides. Although regulations have helped reduce the input of new metals to the environment, the old sites continue to leach toxic metals into groundwater aquifers. Metals present unique challenges for remediation and are usually unreachable for treatment in subsurface by the many methods available to decontaminate surface soils. In certain cases, remediation practices to clean the groundwater rely on subsurface bacteria to biologically and chemically alter the state of pollutants so that they turn into relatively innocuous substances. By stimulating the activity of natural microorganisms it is possible to manipulate the redox state of contaminants and greatly decrease their solubility, rendering them immobile and therefore reducing the risk of human exposure. Accurate numerical models of bioremediation are needed to support design and evaluation of field implementations. Existing models of contaminant bioremediation do not account for the movement of microorganisms, either passive movement with flowing groundwater or active movement by motile bacteria. We hypothesize that inclusion of microbial motility characteristics into a model of bacterial transport will significantly impact model predictions of metal bioremediation. A series of experiments with motile bacteria, using microfluidic devices and advance imaging techniques, will be conducted at the Environmental molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) located at the Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) to quantify the fundamental character of bacterial motion in porous media during active swimming. The experiments will form the basis for development and testing of new models of microbial transport and retention. While motility (a cell-scale phenomenon) cannot be explicitly included in field-scale models, effective transport and attachment/detachment rates can be. Micro-scale experimental observations and the models developed will be included in pore-scale simulations that will be used to generalize and upscale microbial transport to a broader range of pore geometries and flow conditions. The results of pore-scale simulations will be used to parameterize effective transport and retention properties for field-scale models of microbial transport that can be incorporated into existing simulators of metal bioremediation. The laboratory experiments, developed numerical models, and simulations will form the basis for testing of new modeling approaches to study microbial transport and retention, and investigation of upscaling methodologies applicable to field scale problems. For a test case, we will leverage the ongoing research at a field research site in Rifle, Colorado, for which sophisticated numerical models have already been developed. Those models will be extended based on our laboratory experiments and pore-scale studies to evaluate the impacts on predictions of field-scale reduction in bioavailability of uranium. The primary outcome will be a quantitative determination of the role that microbial motility plays in in-situ bioremediation. If, as expected, these effects are shown to be significant, then the models developed here will provide significant improvements to the existing field-scale simulators at the Rifle Integrated Field Research Challenge site. Most importantly, the enhanced models will support improved evaluation and design of future bioremediation implementations, thereby promoting better solutions to contamination problems and reducing risk of exposure to human and environmental receptors."
Novel Microbial Routes to Synthesize Industrially Significant Precursor Compounds,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019338,"North, Justin",Justin.North@theohiostateuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","There is an increasing demand for producing bioproducts and biofuels from plentiful starting materials such as lignocellulose and carbon dioxide feedstocks. We propose to apply a combination of systems biology and bioinformatics approaches, along with a unique toolbox of analytical/&lsquo;omics (metabolomics, proteomics) and molecular/biochemical approaches, to maximize the potential of microorganisms to convert lignocellulose-derived compounds and CO2 to important synthetic precursor compounds such as ethylene and propylene. Ethylene and propylene represent the most widely employed organic compounds in industry, used for the synthesis of several multi-billion dollar and industrially significant products. Today, chemical processes for precursor synthesis require huge amounts of energy derived from fossil fuels, creating an opportunity for biological processes to supplement chemical-based methods for precursor synthesis, especially when petroleum costs become high. Current biological approaches to ethylene formation rely on aerobic metabolisms, which is a problem for potential scale-up because ethylene/oxygen mixtures are flammable. However, using efficient anaerobic ethylene synthetic processes recently discovered by the Tabita laboratory, the potential to significantly impact biological ethylene (and propylene) formation is tenable with plentiful lignocellulose and/or CO2 feedstocks used as starting materials. The overall long-term objective of this proposal is to develop an industrially compatible process to synthesize ethylene in high yields using microbial systems. Based on the discovery in the Tabita lab of a novel and genetically regulated anaerobic pathway to produce high levels of ethylene (the DHAP ethylene pathway), we will seek to fully explore the catalytic potential and molecular control of the enzymes of the pathway. In addition, guided by preliminary indications that more effective enzymes are available from various organisms, we will employ novel selection methods to mine existing databases as well as environmental (metagenomic) DNA for the most effective enzymes to enhance ethylene production levels. Furthermore, we will model the thermodynamics and kinetics of ethylene synthesis pathways in order to simulate central and intermediary metabolism and intracellular flux values that will hint at inefficient regulatory or enzymatic steps that can be targeted for correction. Finally, upon identifying the most effective enzymes, and maximizing their regulation, we will set up plasmid and/or chromosomal modules of these genes and regulatory elements and insert them into desired organisms for conversion of waste feedstocks such as lignocellulose and carbon dioxide to ethylene. The project is a collaborative effort between The Ohio State University (F. Robert Tabita and Kelly C. Wrighton) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (William R. Cannon)."

Fredrickson, University of California, Santa Barbara (Principal Investigator) Christopher M. Bates, University of California, Santa Barbara (Co-Investigator) Thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are used extensively in energy-related applications, for example to lighten transportation vehicles and improve road durability. The key feature underpinning TPE utility is a favorable combination of processability, mechanical strength, and recoverable deformation, which enables straightforward implementation and good performance under harsh conditions. However, existing TPEs can only achieve moderate strength, rigidity, and toughness before losing elasticity, a consequence of their linear polymeric architecture. This project will explore alternative non-linear polymer architectures, specifically a class of promising “mikto-arm” star-shaped block polymers, with the primary goal of understanding how asymmetry in the polymer architecture leads to remarkably improved and unique combinations of physical properties. Specifically, we will target polymers that maintain elasticity at unprecedented (high) loadings of the hard component, yielding TPEs with an unprecedented combination of high modulus, toughness, and recoverable elasticity. We also seek to confer high levels of ionic conductivity to such materials, rendering them suitable as solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for advanced batteries. The project will utilize novel polymer synthesis schemes that will produce a broad palate of polymers at high yield and from a diverse set of low-cost chemical building blocks that will serve as model materials for the scientific studies. The synthetic targets will be informed by state-of-the-art theory and simulation tools, engaging experiment and theory in an interactive loop that will accelerate the understanding of this unique class of polymers and the identification of promising molecular designs for further study. Advanced characterization techniques including small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cyclic mechanical testing will be applied to quantify the microscopic and macroscopic structure and properties of the materials produced. A key question addressed by the project is: what design rules govern the phase behavior and attendant mechanical, dynamical, and ion transport properties of elastomeric mikto-arm star block copolymers containing functional molecular building blocks? Our approach integrates theory and experiment to pursue three research thrusts that probe the impact of mikto-arm polymer design on hierarchical structure–property relationships. A unifying theme throughout is the use of an enabling synthetic platform developed under DOE support called µSTAR, which exploits the heterogeneity of disperse mixtures to readily generate functional mikto-arm materials. We seek to identify the impact of extreme compositions on mechanical performance (thrust 1), ion conductivity (thrust 2), and supramolecular chemical networks (thrust 3) using theory to guide the design, synthesis, and characterization of mikto-arm materials. The outcome of the proposed research will be a foundational platform of new synthetic and theoretical tools that illuminate the fundamental design rules governing the behavior of elastomeric mikto-arm star block copolymers."
Microbial metabolic dependency and its impacts on the soil carbon cycle,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0016364,"Buckley, Daniel",Daniel.Buckley@cornelluniversity,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Project Summary: The terrestrial biosphere contains a large fraction of global carbon (C) and nearly 70% of the organic C in terrestrial systems is found in soils. Global changes in atmospheric CO2, temperature, precipitation, and ecosystem N inputs, will impact primary production and carbon inputs to soils, but it remains difficult to predict soil responses to these environmental conditions. Our ability to predict C-cycle responses to global change remains limited by unexplained variability within the terrestrial C-cycle. Our difficulty in predicting responses of the soil C-cycle to environmental change suggests a need for a greater understanding of the biotic mechanisms that govern soil C-transformations. Changes in microbial community structure and function have been proposed to impact soil processes, but mechanistic connections between microbial activity and C-cycle transformations remain poorly described. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team to conduct a cross-scale examination of microbial contributions to C-cycle dynamics and C-fate in soils. We will investigate the impact of microbial metabolic and ecological dependency on soil C-transformations using a suite of complementary isotopic techniques including HR-DNA-SIP, metagenomic-SIP, metabolomic-SIP, proteomic-SIP, and microspatial analysis of soil organic C. These techniques will be deployed in experiments designed to test fundamental assumptions that underlie terrestrial C-cycle models. We will characterize the functional characteristics of soil microorganisms responsible for major C-transformations in soil, evaluate the metabolic and ecological interactions that underlie soil C-cycle dynamics, and evaluate the degree to which these interactions impact rates of C mineralization and stabilization in soils. Project Objectives: We hypothesize that variation in microbial functional traits constrain and define microbial metabolism in soils. We predict that major functional traits that define C-transformations can be explained in relation to metabolic and ecological dependency. In particular, we predict that these functional traits govern the manner in which microorganisms interact with DOC and POC and that these interactions can explain mechanisms of soil C stabilization. We propose three objectives to explore and categorize microbial functional traits in soil and determine how these ecological constraints impact the fate of soil C. (I) Characterize microbial functional traits associated with mineralization of SOM in the form of DOC and POC. (II) Determine whether microbial functional traits constrain DOC and POC mineralization and the degree to which these differences are defined by metabolic dependency. (III) Determine whether variation in microbial ecophysiology has mechanistic impacts on C fate and whether this information can be used to improve C-cycle models. Impact: This project will identify and characterize the dominant uncultivated microorganisms that mediate major transformations in the soil C-cycle. In particular, we will characterize the functional characteristics of these organisms, obtain and analyze their genome sequences, and evaluate the products of their metabolism in soil. The genetic capacity of microbial communities can be studied through omic approaches but it remains difficult to make direct links between the genetic capacity of microorganisms and their function in the soil C-cycle. Stable isotope probing techniques make it possible to link microbes and their products to soil C-cycle processes as they occur in soil. This research will ultimately reveal the degree to which microbial metabolic and ecological interactions govern mechanisms of C stabilization in soil and we will apply this information to test fundamental assumptions that underlie current models of the terrestrial C-cycle."

While steadily improving, existing quantum hardware is not yet at the threshold required for running generic algorithms, making it important to find new approaches which can run on existing hardware. One of the most promising routes is “quantum simulation”: Given the chemical composition for a material of interest, can we use quantum hardware to predict its low-temperature properties such as electrical conductivity and magnetism? The objective of this research is to develop and deploy quantum simulation algorithms applicable to near-term quantum hardware, focusing on both gate-based quantum computers and Rydberg atom “quantum simulators.” The first approach will pursue efficient algorithms for studying two-dimensional materials like graphene using small gate-based quantum computers. By using the quantum computer to encode the correlations between any two halves of the material, simulations can be performed with resources that scale only with the size of the material’s surface, rather than its volume, greatly reducing the required hardware resources. The second approach will provide a roadmap for using the intrinsic dynamics of arrays of atoms trapped by optical tweezers to simulate the physics of several magnetic compounds whose properties have remained enigmatic for decades. The research will combine analytic methods, large-scale computational modeling, algorithm validation on quantum hardware, and close collaboration with experiments."
Assessing the Influence of Background State and Climate Variability on Tropical Cyclones Using Initialized Ensembles and Mesh Refinement in E3SM,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020072,"Saravanan, Ramalingam",Ramalingam.Saravanan@texasa&muniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Assessing the influence of background state and climate variability on tropical cyclones using initialized ensembles and mesh refinement in E3SM Ramalingam Saravanan, Texas A&M University (Principal Investigator) Ping Chang, Texas A&M University (Co-Investigator) Christina M. Patricola, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Co-Principal Investigator) Travis O&rsquo;Brien, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) One of the important applications of global climate models is to predict anticipated changes in the statistical properties of extreme events. Tropical cyclones are among the extreme events with the greatest socioeconomic impacts in the United States and other regions of the world. Landfalling hurricanes cause significant loss of property and life along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America. Although coarse-resolution global climate models are incapable of simulating individual hurricanes accurately, they do exhibit significant skill in simulating the interannual and decadal variations in the aggregate statistics of hurricanes in the Atlantic basin, when provided the observed sea surface temperature as the boundary condition. We propose to analyze and validate simulated tropical cyclone activity in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), with a focus on tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere. As global climate models approach horizontal spatial resolutions of 25km, their ability to simulate the statistical properties of tropical cyclones becomes an important validation metric. The U.S. CLIVAR Hurricane Working Group recently carried out an intercomparison of tropical cyclone characteristics as simulated by climate models and found that models are indeed able to reproduce the gross features of the geographical distribution of observed global tropical cyclone frequency. However, most models are not able to reproduce the detailed spatial structure of tropical cyclone tracks over the North Atlantic and other regions. In general, regionally-aggregated measures of tropical cyclone activity turn out to be much more predictable than local tropical cyclone occurrences. One of the challenges in simulating the spatial distribution of tropical cyclone track density in global climate models is the effect of climate bias. The genesis and evolution of tropical cyclones is quite sensitive to the large-scale background flow. For example, excessive vertical wind shear can inhibit the development of tropical cyclones. Since atmospheric flow biases can develop within a few weeks from the start of a simulation, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the flow bias effect and other possible deficiencies in the climate model, such as errors in subgrid parameterizations or poor spatial resolution. To address this problem, we propose to use an initialized ensembles approach, where a series of 14-day hindcasts is carried out using the atmospheric component of E3SM. The integrations will be initialized from atmospheric reanalyses every 3 days over the decadal period 2000-2009. By construction, the background flow in these hindcasts will be close to observations. Comparing the statistics of tropical cyclone simulations in the initialized ensemble to that in the control runs will allow us to isolate the impact of mean flow biases. Errors in the representation of fine-scale orographic features in certain areas, such as the Central American Gap Wind region, can also lead to biases in the simulation of tropical cyclones. We propose to use a mesh-refinement approach to better represent orographic features in this region and study its impact on tropical cyclone activity."

In the western USA, mountain snow packs are estimated to feed about three fourth of freshwater and more than 60 million people (Bales et al. 2006). They also represent the dominant-yet-vulnerable control on water availability. Here we choose Coal Creek, Colorado, a high-elevation (~ 2,700 &ndash; 3,700 m) mountainous catchment that has already seen 4 decades of continued temperature increases (> 5?C based on SNOTEL measurements) and declines in snow fractions ( ~ 70% in 1980 to ~50% in 2018). We ask the overarching question of how and how much do hydrological and biogeochemical functioning co-evolve in a warming climate? In particular, how do hydrological characteristics (water storage, flow paths, and travel time) change in response to a warming climate? What are the corresponding alterations in biogeochemical and chemical weathering rates at the watershed scale? What is the general rate law that causally links metrics of hydrological and biogeochemical rates to measures of external hydroclimatic conditions and internal watershed structure characteristics? Using a combination of field measurements, transit time and age modeling, and process-based watershed hydro-biogeochemical modeling, we aim to develop a general rate law at the watershed scale, establishing a largely-unknown linkage between the extensively studied hydrology travel time theory and the recently developed theory on old and new water fraction characteristics affecting biogeochemical and weathering rates. Reaction rate laws are generally derived and parameterized in small- scale and often well-mixed systems that have often been found non-applicable at the watershed scale. The Coal Creek watershed will serve as a model watershed to develop the general watershed-scale rate law, which will be further tested in a constellation of catchments within the USA and across the globe where the PIs have been engaged. These additional sites differ in the levels of snow dominance and geology, topography, and land cover conditions. The general law may be modified and expanded to ultimately encompass a variety of environmental conditions. The proposed work will offer mechanistic understanding of how a warming climate alters water flow, storage, and travel time characteristics; and how and how much such alterations speed up reactions that drive the evolution of catchments and ultimately Earth surfaces. Although these aspects have been extensively studied within disciplinary boundaries, the inter-linkage is not clear and the hydro- biogeochemistry community is often puzzled by watershed process coupling, feedbacks, and emergent behaviors, all of which are important for projecting to the future. This work aims to unravel such linkages by integrating existing knowledge and approaches, crossing hydrology and geochemistry boundaries, and advancing new fronts regarding climate change influences on water quantity and quality. The outcome of this work will advance our forecasting capabilities for water, mass, and energy in the rapidly changing planet. Notably, the developed general rate law will illustrate the first-order principles of hydro-biogeochemical process coupling. Ultimately, it will help develop forward projections to provide insight for adaptation, management, and prevention of water quantity and quality-related catastrophes. The proposed work continues our exploratory project on concentration discharge relationships at Coal Creek, CO. It will extend comprehensive data collection of soil, geologic and hydrologic characteristics, isotopic analyses and modeling of hydro-biogeochemical processes at the watershed scale. More importantly, this work will extend the insights gained from Coal Creek to other sites that are impacted by decreasing snow fractions, and advance the theory that hydrological and biogeochemical coupling are both influenced by Earth system changes."

With the ability in preparing different thickness and composing different heterostructures with the thin films under fine controls in excitations, not only the roles of strong electron correlations can be explored in a systematic fashion, the broken symmetries, topology, and dimensionality can also be investigated. The research will use time, spatial, energy and momentum resolved ultrafast electron probes designed to elucidate the transient states and associated processes during the phase transformation. In particular, the project will leverage on a new adaptive high-brightness electron microscope for high-throughput and direct spatial resolution to address two research areas at the central stage in unveiling nonequilibrium quantum phases. The first one is on the still largely unresolved processes leading to the competitions between different broken symmetry phases in quantum materials. This research will detail the subtle nanoscale inhomogeneities tied to these competitions and their specific dependence on the local synthetic conditions of the specific quantum materials. The new microscopy approaches will allow research team to address these phenomena and correlated with their properties. The second will address the self-organization from far-from-equilibrium transient states. Such properties are normally very difficult to gain control of due to their evolving length scales obscuring the property characterization. With the new imaging capability, the research will focus on elucidating the particular dynamics manifested in space and time near the nonthermal transition point. The knowledge developed from this research project will have significant ramifications in understanding the control mechanism responsible for insulator-metal switching and other emergent properties associated with these strongly correlated and cooperative systems."

This class of crystals, which can form naturally or by artificial synthesis, provides a framework to design inorganic materials with unique properties, such as ultra-low thermal conductivity, superconductivity, and high-density ion storage. The most common inorganic clathrate frameworks are made of group-14 (tetrel) elements (Si, Ge, Sn). In addition, a variety of unconventional clathrates with binary or ternary intermetallic frameworks were recently synthesized, combining transition metals and pnictogens, thus immensely expanding the capability of exploiting these structures for materials design. The objective of this collaborative project is to discover and synthesize novel tetrel-free intermetallic clathrates with targeted electronic structure and transport properties. To this scope, a balanced computational and experimental approach is planned, that relies on the fundamental chemical concepts of electron-balance and guest-host size matching, together with high-throughput calculations, statistical learning, and experimental verification. Hundreds of potential electroneutral III-V and II-VI clathrates will be scanned using a machine-learning algorithm trained on electronic structure calculations of a subset of candidate structures and thousands of known compounds. The stability of the most promising candidates will be refined by density functional theory calculations and tested through experimental synthesis utilizing low-melting salt fluxes and gas transport reactions. The chemical variety of the newly discovered III-V and II-VI clathrates is expected to provide a wider range of mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties beyond those already known for tetrel-based clathrates. Calculations will target the dependence of the transport properties on aliovalent substitutions in the three-dimensional framework, to identify materials with emergent functional properties, that will be synthesized and characterized experimentally. This research will advance both computational and experimental materials chemistry and will shed light on the fundamental principles of bonding, stability, and structure-function relations for a class of inorganic materials, clathrates, which entail a high potential for a large variety of applications in energy-related technologies. These efforts will result in a publicly accessible clathrates database, which will facilitate future research activities of materials chemists and engineers, and condensed matter physicists interested in the emergent properties of clathrates."

The discovery of graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms, has created an exponentially growing interest in two-dimensional materials, such as monolayers of molybdenum disulphide, tungsten disulphide, phosphorene, and boron nitride. Because of their nanometer-scale thickness, their electrical, optical, and mechanical properties are drastically different from their bulk crystals. As individual materials, they have been extensively studied for their potential applications in many devices. However, a more intriguing aspect of these materials is that they provide a new route to fabricating van der Waals multilayer heterostructures. Since the layers are coupled by the van der Waals force, which does not require atomic correspondence, any two-dimensional materials can be potentially combined together to form multilayer structures. This is significantly different from traditional methods to fabricate heteromaterials, where only materials with similar lattice structures can be combined. With hundreds of candidate materials to choose from, this approach can potentially produce a large number of new materials with novel properties, and transform the material discovery. Efficient and controllable transfer of electrons between different layers is a key process for harnessing the emergent properties of the van der Waals multilayers. Based on recent progress on understanding the electron transfer in bilayer heteromaterials formed by materials with similar lattice structures, the program aims to develop fundamental understanding of interlayer electron transfer in complex multilayer structures. The main experimental tools include mechanical exfoliation and dry transfer techniques, steady-state optical spectroscopy, and pump-probe spectroscopy with high time and spatial resolution. We will study electron transfer between atomic layers with distinct lattice structures, quantum-mechanical tunneling of electrons through atomically thin insulating barriers, and control of the electron transfer in multilayers by optically induced electric fields. This program makes contributions to both the development of van der Waals multilayers for electronic and optoelectronic applications and fundamental understanding of electron transfer across van der Waals interfaces. The knowledge about electron transfer will help develop strategies to design multilayers for various energy applications. The program will provide experimental data to test the existing models on electron transfer and develop new ones. Furthermore, the knowledge obtained in this program will contribute to understanding the electron dynamics in other van der Waals materials, such as organic semiconductor heterostructures. This program addresses three Grand Challenges of Basic Energy Sciences identified in the DoE report “Directing Matter and Energy: Five Challenges for Science and the Imagination”. First, understanding effect of quantum-mechanical tunneling of electrons through atomically thin barriers helps address the Grand Challenge of how to control materials processes at the level of electrons. Second, study of the nanometer-scale interlayer electron transfer helps address the Grand Challenge of how to master energy and information on the nanoscale. At last, the interlayer electron transfer occurs on ultrafast time scales with nonequilibrium electron systems. It thus provides a model system to addresses the Grand Challenge of how to characterize and control matter away from equilibrium."

Eveland, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (Principal Investigator) Todd C. Mockler, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (co-Principal Investigator) William Duke Pauli, University of Arizona (co-Principal Investigator) Brian Dilkes, Purdue University (co-Principal Investigator) Project Objectives: This project investigates the innate drought and heat resilience of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], a bioenergy feedstock and cereal crop. The overall project objective is to define and functionally characterize genes and pathways related to drought stress tolerance in sorghum and the molecular mechanisms by which these factors drive phenotypic diversity. This will accelerate the development of improved varieties that are high-yielding with limited water resources. Specific objectives include: 1) Establishing a foundation for deep explorations of gene regulatory networks in sorghum through integrative genomics analyses, 2) Enhancing understanding of how genotype drives phenotype and environmental adaptation using high-resolution, field-based phenotyping of sorghum mutant collections, and 3) Experimentally validating predictions of gene functions using molecular and genetic assays and targeted gene editing. Project Description, Methods and Outcomes: Development of the next generation of bioenergy feedstocks will require strategies that utilize resource-limited agricultural lands, including the introduction of novel traits into crops to increase abiotic stress tolerance. Sorghum is the fifth most widely grown cereal crop worldwide and an attractive system for the development of premiere bioenergy feedstocks. It has innate resilience to drought and heat stresses, versatile end-uses, and a rapidly developing suite of genetic, genomic and phenomic tools. Sorghum is well-poised as a model for gene discovery and, given its adaptability, stress tolerance, and genotypic diversity, it&rsquo;s an excellent crop for studying genotype-to phenotype relationships and dissecting genotype-by-environment interactions. Drought is a complex trait and identifying the genes underlying sorghum&rsquo;s innate drought tolerance and how they are regulated in the broader context of the whole plant and its environment requires advanced approaches in genetics, genomics, and phenotyping. The proposed work leverages a field-based phenotyping infrastructure at Maricopa, AZ, which provides an exceptional capability for managed stress trials in a hot and arid environment through controlled irrigation. An automated field scanner system collects high-resolution phenotyping data using a variety of sensors throughout the growing season, from seedling establishment to harvest. A sorghum mutant population will be phenotyped under the field scanner to compare drought-stressed and well-watered plants. Each mutant carries one or more changes in its DNA compared to an un-mutagenized control, and each mutant&rsquo;s genome has been sequenced so that sequence variants in specific genes, for example, can be linked with phenotypes. Being able to assess this genotype-to-phenotype connection in response to drought over the life cycle of the plant will facilitate discovery of genes and their functions. State-of-the-art phenotyping data analytics pipelines have been developed as part of other DOE-funded initiatives and will be extended here to define stress-related phenotypes at multiple scales. Advanced genomics methods will be used to construct network maps that will provide a framework for predicting and investigating gene functions and interrogating differences in the gene regulatory architectures of diverse sorghum genotypes. This project will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team of scientists who draw upon a broad range of relevant expertise in genomics, phenotyping analytics, quantitative genetics, plant physiology, and development to link genotypes to multi-dimensional phenotypes for accelerated prediction and elucidation of gene functions. Identifying the genes and regulatory networks that underlie phenotypic variation in drought tolerance will ultimately reveal the genetic basis for the remarkable phenotypic plasticity of sorghum. This work will identify control points for enhancing the productivity of bioenergy crops in marginal environments through precision breeding or engineering. This project will also generate invaluable genetic and genomic resources for the community, including expanded sorghum mutant resources, gene network models, sequences, and phenotypes for diverse sorghum germplasm."

The upcoming exascale computing capabilities promises to offer greater predictive ability of simulations and to further push the frontiers of science and technology. However, to validate the simulation output at extreme scale, examine the modeled phenomena, and discover previously unknowns from the output data, the output must be reduced or transformed in situ as it is being generated during the simulation such that the amount of data to examine and store is kept to a minimum. Such in situ approaches allow us to process and analyze the data and any embedded geometry to an extent that would be prohibitively expensive, if not impossible, to perform as a post hoc task. While in situ processing has been demonstrated to be a feasible and promising approach, its full potential has not yet been leveraged. In this project, we will develop comprehensive enhancements to in situ technology based on probability distributions in data. Our research focuses on jointly developing new ways of interacting with massive statistical samples while creatively utilizing new state-of-the-art computational resources to push the boundaries of in situ exploration. Moreover, we will develop new time-dependent techniques to enable previously unattainable capabilities in areas such as intelligent simulation steering and precise feature identification. We will deploy and test our design and implementation at NERSC and OLCF, and we will leverage existing in situ infrastructures whenever possible. While the exemplar in this proposal is combustion, many other fields for which turbulent transport is important, e.g., fusion, climate, astrophysics among others, encounter similar issues as simulations scale up to the exascale. This project is expected to generate high impact on DOE missions since the resulting technology promises to improve scientists&rsquo; ability to rapidly and correctly interpret and tune extreme-scale simulations, leading to new scientific understanding and advancements."

The architecture is determined by the choice of hierarchical zeolites, which provide large channels for macromolecule diffusion and small pores for catalysis. A multiscale computational approach will be used to elucidate physical and chemical interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

Glasser Fusion Theory and Computation, Inc. Toroidal magnetic confinement of hot plasma is one of the principal approaches to the release of fusion energy for peaceful purposes. The parameters of such systems are limited by the onset of instabilities, driven by plasma current and pressure gradients, which can spoil the confinement. An essential requirement of fusion research is to determine whether a given system can be unstable to growing perturbations. A major class of such instabilities is that described by ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which treats the plasma as a perfectly conducting ideal fluid. In the ideal MHD model, the magnetic field and the plasma fluid are locked together. Ideal MHD instabilities are globally distributed and rapidly growing, leading to rapid collapse of confinement and potentially damaging release of energy. When ideal MHD modes are stable, a closely related class of resistive MHD instabilities may still be unstable, leading to slower but still rapid degradation of confinement. Finite electrical resistivity allows the magnetic field and the plasma fluid to slip through each other, enabling the larger class of instabilities. These instabilities can be described by ideal MHD everywhere but in a small neighborhood of singular surfaces, where the growing perturbation is aligned with the confining magnetic field and resistivity and other small effects have their principal effects. The ideal and resistive subdomains are fit together by the method of matched asymptotic expansions to construct global growth rates and eigenfunctions. DCON is a widely-used computer code, developed by the Principal Investigator, for determining whether a given configuration of magnetic field and plasma current and pressure can support ideal or resistive MHD instabilities. It uses advanced mathematical and computational techniques that make it unusually fast and accurate, allowing for large-scale parameter studies and perhaps real-time control of fusion experiments. The purpose of this project is to further develop the DCON code. Improved mathematical techniques will be developed to improve agreement between resistive DCON and the MARS code, which uses simpler and more straightforward methods, treating resistive effects globally. A more realistic kinetic model of the plasma in the singular regions will be developed, allowing for long collisional mean free paths. Ideal DCON will be extended from axisymmetric systems like tokamaks to nonaxisymmetric systems like stellarators. Verification and validation studies will be carried out to bring DCON into agreement with other codes and experimental observations. Efforts will be made to distribute the improved code to other theoretical and experimental fusion physicists."

The increasing complexity of operational computer models has led to renewed interest in surrogate models: computer-based representations of the target phenomena, trained to mimic numerical simulations, but requiring a much lower computational cost than classical approaches. Recent studies have illustrated the potential of surrogate models built using modern machine learning (ML) methodology in a variety of DOE-relevant applications. However, these studies have simultaneously revealed numerous open questions. We lack a foundational understanding of learned surrogate models: when posed with a new task, we cannot assess what models (e.g. Gaussian processes, tensors, or neural networks) are most appropriate; we lack tools for ensuring a surrogate model will be able to capture important features such as singularities, shocks, or other extreme events; and we cannot guarantee that learned surrogate models will generalize across parameters and initial conditions. Furthermore, traditional data assimilation methods and inverse problem solvers were designed with classical numerical solvers in mind and do not exploit new opportunities afforded by surrogate models. The aim of this project is to develop and investigate ML-based surrogate models for representing mathematical models of physical phenomena, estimating parameters of those models, and performing forecasting tasks that may surmount the limitations of current methods. The project's focus is on high-dimensional settings, generalization across a range of parameters and initial and boundary conditions, and accuracy in the presence of rare, extreme events. Success will require synergistic advances in foundational ML, applied mathematics, optimization, and statistics. The project's interdisciplinary team includes researchers from applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, and mathematics at the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory. Underlying these foundational efforts is a focus on several DOE-relevant use-cases, including characterizing large oscillations in the power grid; predicting the likelihood of extended, extreme-temperature events and their impact; and building generalization-capable subgrid fluid models."

Therefore, alternative approaches to forming conjugated linkages are needed and will enable the discovery of materials with improved device performance, stability, and processability. The overarching goal of this project is to explore the catalytic formation of nitrogen–nitrogen double bonds as a strategy to synthesize new conjugated materials. Dinickel catalysts promote the high-yielding dimerization of readily available aromatic azides to form azoarenes. Notably, these reactions proceed under mild conditions, produce no stoichiometric byproducts other than dinitrogen gas, and do not rely on any precious metals. This reactivity will provide access to a broad range of azopolymers .

Gerald Mace, University of Utah (Principal Investigator) Gannet Hallar, University of Utah (Co-Principal Investigator) Our research objective is to investigate the coupling among aerosols, clouds, and precipitation over the Southern Ocean (SO) and other high latitude regions recently documented by DOE ARM facility field campaigns. The Southern Ocean is unique on Earth as it is largely isolated from anthropogenic influences while Circumpolar oceanic currents (ACC) and upwelling tend to isolate the Southern Ocean from the amplified warming observed in the Northern Hemisphere Arctic. We have laid the foundation for this work in our ongoing ASR-funded research. We have analyzed a unique data set collected from ships during the summer of 2018 that significantly constrains the properties and relationships among aerosols, clouds, and precipitation over a longitude domain between Hobart, Tasmania and East Antarctica. To build upon this foundation, we ask very specific questions regarding how aerosol composition over the Southern Ocean, relates to seasonally varying biological productivity to modulate the properties of clouds in the presence of precipitation of both liquid and ice phases. Using analysis methodologies specifically tailored to the data sets we seek to analyze, we propose to address the following science questions: 1. What are the determining processes that control cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the high latitude Southern Ocean and the ACC region to the north? 2. What is the process-level association between surface observed cloud condensation nuclei and marine boundary-layer cloud and radiative properties – in particular the cloud droplet number concentration of boundary layer clouds? 3. What is the role of cloud and precipitation processes in the cloud-aerosol interaction in this pristine region? To address these questions, we will expand our data analysis methodology that combines aerosol size and compositional time series with active and passive remote sensing collected by lidars, radars, and radiometers from several recent measurement campaigns. Uniquely, we will use radar Doppler spectra to isolate the cloud droplet radar reflectivity combined with lidar-derived cloud extinction to derive cloud droplet number concentrations in the presence of light precipitation. Precipitation properties will be derived from combinations of radar and lidar as well using established methodologies tailored to the data sets we analyze. A unique aspect of our approach is to place the ARM data into context provided by, 1. A suite of NASA satellites that largely replicate the ARM measurements in less detail but with greater spatial coverage over all seasons 2. Backwards airmass trajectories. Uniquely, to better constrain the air mass history, we will document the aerosol, cloud, and precipitation properties along those back trajectories using satellite data. 3. Collaborate with several domestic and international modeling groups to determine the extent to which the models are able to replicate the processes that are documented in the ARM data within the unique air masses that the ARM data observed.

A central challenge for their development is the fragility of qubits: All qubits incur random errors due to undesirable interactions with their dissipative environment, a process known as decoherence. The common approaches for suppressing quantum errors have focused on device-level isolation from the environment and software-level implementation of quantum error correction codes. Recently, an intermediate and unifying approach emerges from the progress in “quantum reservoir engineering”. Surprisingly, the environmental interaction can be tailored, rather than eliminated, to provide the equivalent of a restoring force to the qubits, which can stabilize quantum superpositions and even passively correct errors in encoded logical qubits. The goal of this research is to experimentally establish a paradigm of using engineered dissipation to reduce errors in the storage and manipulation of qubits. We employ a leading candidate platform for quantum computation, the superconducting circuit QED, where we choose to use 3D superconducting microwave cavity oscillators as qubits. More specifically, we encode logical qubits in the bosonic states of the cavities with a specific photon number parity, and use standard Josephson circuits known as transmons as ancillas for quantum control. The project builds on our initial demonstration of a parity-recovery dissipation operator capable of autonomously reversing cavity photon loss without the large quantum and classical resource overhead needed for active error correction. The dissipative process will be systematically characterized, refined, and integrated with other stabilization schemes and unitary control, leading to improved logical qubit lifetime and logical gate fidelity. If successful, this project establishes these self-stabilized individual qubits and gates as improved building blocks for generic intermediate scale applications of quantum computing without the need of large-scale error correction."

In the current era of machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and other data-driven tools to solve inverse problems, the capability to efficiently simulate forward problems and generate high-quality data is of utmost importance. In particular for fluid mechanics applications, the accurate prediction of local quantities on and near moving and deforming interfaces is valuable for reduced-order turbulence models, simulating and optimizing sensor placements, and predicting structural loadings. Algorithmic challenges in accurately and efficiently simulating such problems are posed by the large spatio-temporal scale separation of the physical processes in each domain, the large motions and deformations of the interface separating the domains, and the coupling between the different domains across such moving interfaces. Further, current pre-exascale parallel computing architectures and the developments towards exascale systems demand an algorithmic approach that can be efficiently load-balanced, contains fast elliptic solvers, and minimizes the number of global operations. To tackle these challenges, we aim to develop a mathematical paradigm that combines an extension of the Immersed Interface Method (IIM) for high-fidelity treatment of sharp moving interfaces, with an efficient and unified tight coupling strategy for interface-coupled multiphysics problems. We plan to embed these tools in a scalable software framework using wavelet-based adaptive grids, an efficient free-space multiresolution elliptic solver, and a new formulation of local time stepping. We will demonstrate the capabilities of our computational contributions by simulating and validating two representative and relevant applications: two-phase incompressible flows, and fluid-structure interactions. Overall, this proposal creates a novel paradigm in high-fidelity numerical solutions of tightly-coupled PDEs with moving interfaces and large spatio-temporal scales separations. In particular, our choice to formally treat the grid refinement, the local time stepping, and the enforcement of boundary conditions, leads to a framework that can generalize to other fields without losing consistency. Further, we envision that our work provides a unified basis for testing and comparing future approaches to single- or multiphysics simulations, such as the coupling of more than two physical domains. Lastly, beyond the scope of this proposal, the extension to industrial applications involving fluid flows can be enabled by formally integrating the IIM with existing turbulence models, opening an exciting avenue for efficient multiresolution simulations of high Reynolds number flows coupled with moving and deforming embedded boundaries."

The AIDE-QC, led out of LBNL by Project Director Wibe Albert de Jong, with Travis Humble from ORNL as the deputy, will integrate a multidisciplinary team of five Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories and the University of Chicago to address critical aspects of computer science research that accelerate the integration of near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for scientific exploration. Theses advances include high-level programming languages accessible by domain scientists, novel error -mitigation techniques for near and mid-term hardware devices, and leading-edge platform agnostic compilers supported by classical numerical simulators and robust tools for validation, verification and debugging approaches. The goal of AIDE-QC is to develop and deliver open-source computing, programming, and simulation environments that support the large diversity of quantum computing research at DOE. The AIDE-QC team builds on its expertise in quantum computer science accumulated from prior research under the DOE ASCR QAT and QCAT research programs. Our team also has extensive experience interacting with domain scientists to explore application-aware programming of quantum computers, and we have formed strong collaborations to explore architecture-aware programming with the current DOE ASCR Quantum Testbeds and Quantum Testbeds Pathfinder programs as well as other hardware developers in national laboratories, academia and industry. This broad background provides our team with the essential capabilities and key insights, including use cases, interfaces, and resource requirements, to deliver state-of-the-art quantum computing software. Key to the success of the ARQC program is a close relationship between complementary teams focused on software and algorithms research, such as the AIDE-QC and FAR-QC teams. Our team will use these partnerships to engage in training and outreach as well as a growing list of conferences and workshops. We will also engage the nascent quantum computing software community by fostering collaboration with the growing use base to discuss ideas and concerns in the broader development of quantum software. We will also be highly engaged with hardware development teams at the DOE laboratories and industrial research labs, as essential partners in co-design of the whole quantum computing infrastructure stack. In particular, we will leverage our team&rsquo;s existing partnerships with the advanced quantum testbeds at LBNL and Sandia, as well as established partners in industry. We will also leverage ASCR&rsquo;s high-performance computing facilities (OLCF, ALCF, NERSC) to establish versatile, scalable and accurate numerical simulators in order to provide a state-of the-art platforms for debugging and testing algorithms and software developed by the research community."
Development of Solid Isotope Harvesting Methods in Preparation for FRIB,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0020161,"Francesconi, Lynn",Lynn.Francesconi@researchfoundationofthecityuniversityofnewyorkd/b/arfcuny-huntercollege,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Title: Development of Solid Isotope Harvesting Methods in Preparation for FRIB Lead P.I.: Jennifer Shusterman (Hunter College of the City University of New York) Co-Investigators: Nicholas Scielzo (co-PI), Mark Stoyer, Dawn Shaughnessy (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), Gregory Severin (co-PI, Michigan State University) Within the nuclear science community, there is unmet demand for radionuclides with high elemental and isotopic purity. There are a number of radionuclides that currently cannot be produced either in the quantities or purities desired for applications [1,2]. In traditional production methods, charged-particle reactions or nuclear reactor irradiations are used with stable targets to make the desired radioisotopes. With these routes, stable target nuclei vastly outnumber the produced radioisotopes and are typically close in atomic number, making it difficult to chemically separate the species. For many applications, any remaining stable material can interfere with the final measurement. An alternate route of radionuclide production that avoids this problem is isotope harvesting from a radioactive ion beam facility such as the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) or the upcoming Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB). In tuning and purifying the high intensity beams at FRIB for delivery to the primary user, many radioactive beam fragments will be stopped at various points throughout the accelerator and mass-separator. Isotope harvesting is the collection of these accumulated radioactive beam fragments, which can ideally be done without interfering with ongoing dedicated experiments. Taking advantage of beam products produced at FRIB will provide an avenue to access some of these hard-to-produce radionuclides. While samples collected via isotope harvesting will contain a wide range of radionuclides, purity can be vastly improved with a tailored selection of collector phase and material. Isotope harvesting can be realized via solid, aqueous, or gaseous modes, with this work focused on solid collection. To date, aqueous isotope harvesting has been investigated at the NSCL in a series of successful experiments [3&ndash;6], however, isotope harvesting from solid beamline components, has had relatively little proof-of-concept work done. Solid isotope harvesting can be done at multiple locations in the accelerator, including within the mass separator, where more pure beam fragments can be obtained. The proposed work aims to investigate solid collector materials, ranging in mass and density, and the chemistry methodologies required to purify select radionuclides from them. A PAC proposal (PI: Shusterman) to the NSCL to test various solid collector materials used to stop 88Zr has been approved for time. We will use 88Zr as the initial beam to test various materials because its collection has already been demonstrated with aqueous harvesting (PI: Scielzo), which will provide a benchmark for comparison of the methods. Additionally, 88Zr is an ideal choice because it has a suitable half-life (83.4 days) to allow for radiochemical studies on the irradiated material and emits an intense &gamma; ray allowing for easy detection with &gamma;-ray spectroscopy. Various isotopes of Zr are important to applications in nuclear medicine (89Zr, 86Zr), stockpile stewardship (88Zr), and astrophysics (95Zr), making the chemistry required to recover it from the solid collectors relevant to many areas of nuclear science. The proposed work leverages both the nuclear and radiochemistry expertise of the team. The undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researcher who will be recruited for this project will be trained in both areas, gaining experience in all aspects in the development of these new isotope production methods, such as fielding collection experiments at an accelerator facility, performing radiochemical separations, and analyzing samples with various nuclear counting approaches.

Corrinoids as Model Nutrients to Probe Microbial Interactions in a Soil Ecosystem,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020155,"Taga, Michiko",Michiko.Taga@theregentsofuniversityofcalifornia,"['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Earth&rsquo;s soils are habitats for communities of microorganisms that promote plant growth, store carbon, and cycle nutrients. The thousands of microbial species living in soil form an intricate web of nutrient-sharing interactions in which some species produce nutrients that other members cannot make. The overall goal of this research is to understand how these molecular exchanges occur and how they shape microbial communities. Understanding soil nutritional interactions in detail may lead to new methods to improve soil health, resulting in increased agricultural efficiency and carbon capture. However, the high level of diversity in soil microbiomes makes it challenging to achieve this goal using current microbiology methods. This research leverages a group of key nutrients related to vitamin B12, known as corrinoids, to investigate soil microbial interactions. Different bacterial species must share corrinoids, because they are made by only a subset of the bacteria that use them. Corrinoids are used for a variety of metabolic processes critical for bacteria in soil and other environments, such as synthesizing DNA and breaking down various carbon and energy sources. Importantly, corrinoids are structurally diverse, and bacteria in isolation can use only some of the corrinoid forms that are available in their environment. Whether this specificity impacts bacterial growth and metabolism on a community scale has not been studied. Because different bacteria require different corrinoids, we hypothesize that corrinoids are keystone nutrients that can shape soil microbial communities. To test this hypothesis, we will examine the effects of corrinoid addition on bacterial populations across multiple levels of complexity, using custom-synthesized corrinoids for those that are not commercially available. We will use DNA sequencing-based approaches to determine which bacteria are present in soil and soil-derived enrichments, and measure how they respond to different corrinoids. We will also use the sequencing data to predict which species produce and use particular corrinoids, and test these predictions by measuring corrinoid dependence of individual bacterial species isolated from soil. By investigating a key nutrient at levels spanning the whole community to individual isolates, this work will provide an unprecedented and multifaceted view of metabolic interactions in a soil microbial community. Determining how key nutrients impact microbial abundance and activity could lead to new strategies for managing soils for agricultural and environmental applications."

This proposal builds on the PI’s previous program (DESC0019154), which explored the nature of superconductivity in topological materials lacking inversion symmetry using a joint experimental and theoretical effort to focus on understanding the topological superconducting state of the non-centrosymmetric material YPtBi. Our previous work has led to a new understanding of “high-spin” superconductivity arising from a spin-3/2 band structure, which is the first time such physics has been considered theoretically for a superconductor, and has sparked a flurry of activity understanding j=3/2 physics. More recently, our discovery of spin-triplet pairing in UTe2 has sparked an intense race to identify its multi-component order parameter and topological properties. Following these advances, our proposal is designed to further explore these materials using an established in-house synthesis and characterization program and an extensive collaboration network in order to elucidate the potential of these materials to form the next generation platform for quantum technologies. Applying this to a narrowed list of 5d-containing perturbations of the well-characterized RPtBi and RPdBi Heusler materials as well as UTe2, our in-house experimental approach involves exploration of normal state topology using transport, magnetic and thermodynamic properties measurements in high magnetic fields; of magnetism via chemical substitution and neutron scattering studies; of pairbreaking effects using transport and thermodynamic experiments on systematically irradiated samples; and of multi-component superconductivity using thermal transport and specific heat studies as a function of several tuning parameters. With collaborators, we plan to extend these studies to elucidate band structures, disorder effects, time reversal symmetries, anisotropies and Majorana physics using a variety of tools. Together, these systems have strong potential for leading the development of a new generation of topological superconductors."
Efficient and Reliable Mapping of Quantum Computations Onto Realistic Architectures,Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research,DE-SC0019040,"Childs, Andrew",Andrew.Childs@universityofmaryland,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Efficient and Reliable Mapping of Quantum Computations Onto Realistic Architectures Andrew Childs, University of Maryland (Principal Investigator) Alexey Gorshkov, University of Maryland (Co-Investigator) Michael Hicks, University of Maryland (Co-Investigator) Xiaodi Wu, University of Maryland (Co-Investigator) Robert Rand, University of Maryland (Key Personnel) Quantum computers offer the prospect of efficiently solving certain problems that would be intractable for classical computers. Potential applications of quantum computers include several challenges of relevance to the DOE science and energy mission, including simulations of quantum mechanical systems, quantum approaches to approximate optimization, and numerical methods for scientific computing. However, the limited abilities of current quantum hardware make it challenging to realize these benefits with existing devices. The proposed work will develop methods and tools for implementing quantum algorithms as efficiently and reliably as possible on realistic hardware and for evaluating the capabilities of such devices, facilitating computation on near-term quantum processors. Algorithms for quantum computers are typically formulated in an abstract circuit model that allows gates between any two qubits at the same cost. However, realistic quantum processors come with strong constraints on the possible interactions. Mapping a given quantum circuit onto such a realistic device will necessarily incur overhead depending on factors including the system architecture, the underlying quantum computation, and the method used to construct the mapping. Our proposed work aims to develop theoretical and computational tools for addressing this challenge that are efficient, robust, and incur minimal overhead. We will apply these tools to address both research areas suggested in the call for proposals: studying the interplay between architectural and algorithmic choices and quantitatively understanding the potential for near-term quantum devices to address scientific challenges. This work will be organized around three interrelated research thrusts: Circuit layout. To understand the effect of device architecture on the ability of a quantum processor to carry out quantum computations, it is crucial to develop methods for translating quantum circuits for algorithms of interest into ones that respect a given set of architectural constraints. A key thrust of our proposal is to produce a suite of algorithms for mapping quantum circuits to realistic architectures and implement them in software. Using these tools, we will explore the impact of architectural features on our ability to perform practical quantum computations, providing insights into the design of quantum architectures and evaluating the ability of realistic devices to carry out computations relevant to the DOE science mission. Effect of interaction range. One of the defining features of any quantum computing platform is the range of available two-qubit interactions, with longer-range interactions allowing for faster computation. Some of the most advanced quantum computing platforms include long-range interactions. The second key thrust of our proposal is to harness such interactions to achieve computational speedups relative to architectures with nearest-neighbor interactions. We will also prove bounds on how quickly a given quantum algorithm can run using interactions of a given range. By combining the protocols and bounds that we develop, we will attempt to determine algorithm implementations for a given architecture that have the shortest possible running time, illuminating the relationship between device architecture and algorithm performance. Formal methods. The final thrust of our work is the application of formal methods and techniques from the field of programming languages. Our goal is to develop novel tools to ensure that quantum programs are implemented and analyzed properly. Such tools will add confidence to the conclusions of our own analysis of near-term architectures and will also be of general use to the broader community. The result should be a much greater ability to reliably reason about the complexity and performance of near-term quantum devices."
Toward a Quantum Spin Liquid - Materials and Measurement,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0017862,"Ramirez, Arthur",Arthur.Ramirez@theregentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Toward a Quantum Spin Liquid – Materials and Measurement Arthur P. Ramirez, University of California, Santa Cruz (Principal Investigator) Information technology relies on integrated circuits that perform classical logic operations. Over the years, processing speed-up has been achieved at both the software level and the physical level by incremental improvements known collectively as Moore’s law. At the physical level, these improvements address the challenges of reducing the size of basic logic units in order to increase their on-chip density. This reduction of feature size is approaching its physical limits, which are dictated by the properties of the semiconductor, the insulating gate barrier, and the metal interconnects. In order to tackle much more difficult computational problems in realms of national security, economic leadership, and even weather prediction, quantum computing has arisen as an attractive adjunct to classical computers. A quantum computer will require a new type of integrated circuit, however, one that performs operations on a fully coherent quantum mechanical state, as opposed to the present classical computers. Among the many different approaches to quantum computing presently being pursued is topological quantum computing, which seeks to reduce the amount of processing time needed to perform error correction. Two types of physical systems have been proposed for this purpose, namely the fractional quantum Hall state in two-dimensional electron gases and the coherent magnetic state predicted to occur in a class of materials called quantum spin liquids. While research in electron gas systems has been pursued for over a decade, the understanding of quantum spin liquid materials is in a more primitive stage. This proposal seeks to discover new materials, new ways of parametrically controlling known materials, and new metrologies for probing the quantum spin liquid state. The key feature of a quantum spin liquid is that the atomic magnetic moments, or spins, are still highly fluctuating at temperatures so low that all non-magnetic excitations, such as lattice vibrations and charge motion, are not active. Such excitations can lead to de-coherence of the quantum state, rendering it disordered and classical. The required absence of these excitations means that the atomic spins are strongly interacting below one degree Kelvin, or -457.9 degrees Fahrenheit. From a materials standpoint, two ingredients are essential. The first is the suppression, or frustration, of conventional classical states such as the antiferromagnet. Such frustration is usually achieved in crystalline structures where the magnetic atoms sit on a triangle-based lattice. The second ingredient is the use of an atom, such as copper or iridium, possessing a spin that is small and thus prone to quantum fluctuations. Few systems exist that meet both criteria and are also obtainable in high-quality crystalline form, a requirement for quantum coherence. One thrust of this project is to collaborate with crystal chemists to find new compounds that meet these criteria The second thrust of our project is to induce quantum coherence by an external field. In many materials the temperature at which classical order occurs can be reduced towards zero by application of an external magnetic field. We will follow up on our recent work demonstrating field-induced quantum coherence in a linear-chain copper compound by studying planar arrays of atomic spins. This line of investigation will also encompass newly-found phenomena in magnets that display plateaus in magnetization plotted versus applied field. Such plateaus are dramatic demonstrations of so-called “topological quantization” that may be a harbinger of strong quantum coherence. The third thrust of our project anticipates the development of a quantum spin liquid ground state, which theory tells us should have topological properties. One can think of such properties as the quantum version of classical vortices. Vortices have the property that, when densely arrayed in a planar system, produce spin alignment at the boundary which differs qualitatively from the spin alignment in the interior. In order to probe such effects, we will develop the technique of spin transport applied to quantum magnets. This technique, in which spin torque is injected into a magnet using a metal with large coupling between atomic spins and their orbital degree of freedom, has demonstrated its ability to characterize spin ordering in classical systems. We will apply this technique to systems in the regime of quantum coherence, namely high quality crystals at temperatures below one degree Kelvin. Because spin injection and detection occurs locally at the metal electrodes, the possibility exists to reduce the size of these electrodes to a length scale that would allow the detection of non-local spin transport. The experimental condensed matter work described here supports the Department of Energy mission by advancing the collective fundamental understanding of complex quantum materials with potential use in high speed information systems beyond the capability of present classical machines. The broader impact of this work will be the training of the next generation of materials physicists with direct experience in materials development in pursuit of quantum information control."

Schatz (Principal Investigator) Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208-3113 This research is concerned with the development of theoretical and computational methods for describing photoinduced chemical reactions and related spectroscopic properties involving molecules that are adsorbed onto the surfaces of metal nanoparticles composed of silver, gold, aluminum and other metals that are capable of collective electronic excitations known as plasmons. Photoexcitation of these particles with visible light is known to cause chemical reactions in the adsorbed molecules, typically involving electrons or holes that are transferred to the molecules, and there is substantial evidence that this occurs under nonthermal conditions involving “hot” electrons or holes. There are two components to the proposed research: (1) the development of an electronic structure method that is capable of defining the electronic states of metal nanoparticles plus adsorbed molecules including both plasmonic states and states associated with charge transfer, and (2) methods for describing the time dependence of the electron and nuclear dynamics that occurs when the nanoparticles are irradiated with a pulse of light, including theories that describe both direct charge transfer to the adsorbed molecules, and that describe plasmon excitation followed by dephasing to electron-hole pairs and the indirect excitation of charge transfer states. The electronic structure method is based on “domain separated” time dependent density functional theory (DS-TDDFT) which is a newly developed embedding method in the Schatz group that provides the capability of using high level electronic structure theory for selected portions of a metal plus molecule system, and lower level theory elsewhere, with the goal in this work of providing electronic states that accurately describe both plasmons and charge transfer states in the metal plus molecule systems. The electron/nuclear dynamics calculations involve two components: (1) describing the evolution of electronic states at short times with Liouville and Maxwell-Liouville approaches using a diabatic basis that describes both plasmon and electron-hole pair excitations, and also including charge transfer states with coupling to external electromagnetic fields, and (2) nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations to describe evolution at longer times using a reduced dimension model that is associated with the charge transfer state obtained from the Liouville or Maxwell-Liouville description. Another component of this project is the use of a recently developed second linear response (SLR) TDDFT method to calculate transient absorption spectra and electronic Raman spectra for the metal plus molecule systems, and using these new approaches to provide insights about excited state dynamics that relates to plasmon induced chemistry. In addition to the specific study of plasmon enhanced chemistry, the new methods to be developed will impact more broadly in theoretical chemistry, with DS-TDDFT providing a general embedding method for calculating spectroscopic properties where more conventional DFT methods have trouble, and the Maxwell-Liouville methods are capable of describing excited state dynamics that touches on strong coupling effects (electromagnetic interactions with the electronic states of molecules that shift energy levels enough to change their chemistry) that are also important in optical cavities, plasmon-laser modeling, and many other processes."
Radiation Effects in Carbides and Borides,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-FG02-08ER46493,"Szlufarska, Izabela","Izabela.Szlufarska@boardofregentsoftheuniversityofwisconsinsystem,operatingasuniversityofwisconsin-madison","['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Radiation effects in carbides and borides Motivation: Materials subjected to the extreme environments of nuclear reactors need to be able to maintain their properties under a continuous exposure to radiation. Radiation leads to displacements of atoms from their lattice positions and these point defects need to be annealed efficiently to recover the radiation damage. Many carbides and borides have been already used or are considered for potential applications in nuclear reactors. These materials have either covalent or partially-covalent bonding and as a result, their defects are characterized by a complex energy landscape, which in turn can have a profound impact on the rates and the mechanisms of radiation damage recovery. Defect recovery processes involve either defects reacting with each other to restore the perfect crystal lattice or diffusion and segregation of defects to sinks, such as grain boundaries. If one of the constituent elements of the alloy segregates to the grain boundary faster than another, the chemical composition of the grain boundaries can change – a phenomenon termed radiation-induced segregation (RIS). Evolution of the atomic and chemical structures of grain boundaries under irradiation are critical to understand and control because grain boundaries govern many of the properties that are relevant for nuclear reactor applications, such as fracture toughness, corrosion resistance, and thermal conductivity. RIS has been known in metals for a long time, but limited studies have been carried out on RIS in ceramics. For example, we have recently reported that RIS is possible in silicon carbide, despite the fact that this material has a strong desire to form stoichiometric compounds. Objectives: The goal of this project is to build on our results in SiC and discover general trends and fundamental principles that control behavior of radiation-induced defects in a broad class of materials with covalent bonding, focusing on carbides and borides. The scientific focus of this project is on understanding the role of off-stoichiometry (radiation-induced or inherent to the material) and the role of the type of bonding (carbon vs. boron bonding, various types of covalently-bonded networks in materials with mixed covalent and metallic bonding, and 3D layering) on radiation damage recovery. Description: The project has three thrusts, each developed around an overarching scientific hypothesis and each contributing to the central theme of the proposal, which is to understand the role of off-stoichiometry and the role of bonding in radiation resistance of carbides and borides. These thrusts are: (i) Radiation-induced segregation (we hypothesize that it can occur in other carbides and in borides, and that the extent of RIS depends on the number of stable bulk phases the material can have, and on the local compositions that can be accommodated at grain boundaries); (ii) Off-stoichiometry in TiCx (we hypothesize that interstitial carbides can easily accommodate off-stoichiometric defect fluxes, leading to a more effective defect recovery processes, and to a superior radiation-resistance), and (iii) MAB phases (we hypothesize that specific types of covalent bonding network in 3D layered borides (MAB) can lead to superior radiation resistance). This project lays out plans for the first broader study of RIS in ceramics. Experimental study of RIS will be enabled by our newly developed approach to making ceramic bicrystals through high-pressure high-temperature bonding. In this project, the PI’s group is also pioneering exploration of the potential of MAB phases as radiation-resistant materials. Finally, one of the important strengths of this proposal is the tight integration of the computational and the experimental approaches, where the approaches are organized around scientific questions and the different methods complement each other’s strengths and limitations. Simulation approaches include atomistic simulations (both classical and ab initio), genetic algorithms, and rate theory modelling. Experimental approaches include ion irradiation and state of the art microscopy techniques."

The M-APDs represent a new strategy to achieve high-performance APDs and would allow a precise and reliably characterization of optical quantum states via homodyne detection. To achieve this objective, we will in Phase I demonstrate the high absorption (>90%) of 1550 nm light within a 100 nm-thick InGaAs layer on a low index substrate in a typical APD structure by coupling an appropriately designed metasurface. We will in Phase II fabricate the design optimized in Phase I and demonstrate M-APD operation with about two orders-of- magnitude reduction in dark current as compared to a state-of-the-art APD. We propose a 12-month Phase I program to demonstrate that with a suitable metasurface, a 100 nm thick InGaAs layer can absorb the same amount of 1550 nm light as a micron-thick conventional InGaAs layer, which is the key to achieving M-APDs. We will use a synergetic modeling method that combines accurate finite-element simulations of metasurfaces, realistic Monte-Carlo simulations of carrier scattering, impact ionization and diffusion, and efficient mesoscopic device modeling to design suitable metasurfaces. We will take advantage of our extensive experience in infrared device fabrication and characterization to attain the designed metasurfaces and analyze their beneficial effect on optical absorption. A successful demonstration of M-APDs with high quantum efficiency, large bandwidth, and low noise would have an immediate impact to the field of quantum information. The M-APDs can be used to achieve high-fidelity optical homodyne tomography. Our approach also represents a new strategy of improving APD’s performance and will undoubtedly inspire new designs of M-APDs and boost their applications in quantum processing and 3-D laser ranging LIDAR."

Many systems that arise from such applications have a large fraction of their interesting dynamics constrained to a low-dimensional manifold. However, low-dimensional data-driven dynamical system surrogates exhibit poor performance when used for long-time predictions, even when interpolations and short-time predictions seem reasonable. State-of-the-art large-scale dynamical system training relies almost entirely on cost-function minimization with simple stability promoting extensions, such as ad-hoc constraints on the Jacobian, or regularizations of the neural network, to promote smoothness. Unfortunately, these methods do not address the limited stability of data-driven surrogate models particularly in the presence of unknown adversarial perturbations, for example, when they are deployed autoregressively. For long-term predictions, low stability manifests itself as solutions that explode or converge to unphysical hyperbolic sets. This project aims to address stable long-time prediction from massive datasets of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The project consists of two primary innovations: (1) adaptive, standardized manifold discovery techniques and (2) manifold constrained surrogate learning with enhanced stability.

Its successful realization will require resolving many outstanding problems, such as long-distance high-fidelity transmission of quantum states, entanglement of multiple network nodes, realization of error correction protocols, etc. There have been two parallel developments of quantum computing and information processing models and systems: one is based on discrete variables (DVs) and the other on continuous variables (CVs), with each having its own unique advantages and functions within the network architecture. Interconnecting these two platforms with quantum optical links to form a hybrid quantum network (QN) will pave the way towards quantum local area networks (Q-LANs), distributed quantum computation, and future quantum Internet, where DV-CV hybrid entanglement and distribution is central to all building blocks. In this project we aim to construct a hybrid DV-CV mesh topology Q-LAN physical testbed with at least five nodes by making use of hybrid entanglement between discrete quantum variables – optical polarizations of a single photon – and continuous variables – so called Schrodinger cat states that are superpositions of two coherent states. In the proposed network both classical and quantum information transmissions via optical fiber links will be operated on ITU grids in C and L telecom bands that allow lowest fiber losses. At the system level, we will demonstrate entanglement traffic engineering and management for multi-users multi-hop transparent optical quantum networks that requires no quantum repeaters and routers. We will implement network channels for entanglement labeling and identification, as well as shaking-hand protocols for building multi-users multi-hop path links. The following are our research objectives from physical layer to system level: 1) To demonstrate optical hybrid entanglement and swapping between discrete polarizations and continuous quadrature variables; 2) To develop DV-CV hybrid polarization qubit wavelength convertor from near IR to telecom spectral range for long-distance fiber transmission; 3) To construct a hybrid DV-CV optical Q-LAN with at least five nodes; 4) To develop quantum network protocols and algorithms for distributed quantum information processing; and 5) To develop a software platform for managing entanglement traffic and resources. Overall, our hybrid network will offer versatile links to connect single-photon polarization nodes with CV quantum nodes, and thus will provide a promising approach for building a feasible quantum network. Besides, the proposed quantum tools and protocols will be useful for many other DOE strategic interests such as distributed quantum computing and scalable quantum information processing."

We propose to integrate optimizations into the quantum compilers from the bottom up to optimize and enhance the robustness and scaling of noisy computation. From the top-down, we propose to use higher-level programming constructs studied in the classical world, such as probabilistic programming or approximate computing to expand the toolkit of quantum programming languages further considering the underlying stochastic and probabilistic nature of a noisy quantum computation. While our efforts will focus on near-term noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computation, our approach will have direct applicability to future fault-tolerant quantum computers as well. Achieving quantum supremacy in the NISQ-era and beyond will require continued reduction in noise levels and optimizations in quantum circuits that consider the underlying hardware constraints, including noise characteristics. Our proposed research collaboration will compromise two thrusts: (1) a noise characterization and mitigation effort and (2) a compiler and computer science thrust. To bridge these two research thrusts, we will build and release an open source hardware-agnostic compiler and software stack that applies these techniques as a toolbox. Since these methods have a large impact on top level performance, it will be important to have a standard toolbox like this to use in the growing amount of hardware and software benchmarking that will be done over the coming years. In order to accomplish the proposed research, we have assembled a diverse team of scientists; this includes team members from the classical and quantum computer science communities working together with experts in quantum characterization and control, applied mathematics, and physics. The noise characterization and mitigation thrust area will focus on integrating noise characterization and error mitigation within the compiler tool chain for both physical and algorithmic layer error mitigation. Understanding the underlying noise processes in the single and multi-qubit setting is a key aspect to developing optimized control and error mitigation techniques for quantum computing hardware. By incorporating noise characterization protocols in conjunction with control and error mitigation techniques, we will realize an automated tool chain for enacting noise-tailored error mitigation and optimization for specific hardware environments. In the quantum programming and compilation thrust will investigate how classical programming paradigms such as approximate computing and probabilistic programming can be applied in the quantum case. Our intention is to use these techniques to further optimize the quantum program in the presence of noise."

Emulsions are generally not stable and require a surfactant to keep the droplets from coalescing. Nanoemulsions are special class of emulsions that have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their unique potential applications in drug delivery, oil recovery, and as nanoreactors for producing novel polymers and nanomaterials with less environmental impact. Key to advancing the utility of these and related nanoscale systems is to develop the needed molecular-level understanding of the structure and bonding interactions present at the surface of these soft nanoparticles. The objective of these studies is just that: to advance our understanding of how surfactants and polymers bond at the surface of nano emulsions. The studies have important relevance to oil extraction as well as oil spill remediation, both which rely on emulsification of oil by stable and environmentally safe surfactant systems. The project involves a series of carefully designed studies that explore the molecular nature of adsorption and surface interactions by (1) Characterization of the molecular bonding and structural properties of interfacial molecules that contribute to the stabilization of nanoemulsions (100-600 nm diameter); (2) Determination of the molecular factors that contribute to the unique assembly and bonding when model polymers and surfactants co-adsorb synergistically to stabilize nanoemulsions with unique properties; (3) Development and utilization of new computational approaches for understanding macromolecular adsorption at these interfaces. Our approach involves measuring the surface vibrational spectroscopy of the surfactant coated particle surfaces in-situ using vibrational sum frequency scattering spectroscopy (VSFSS), with related complementary studies of these surfactant systems examined at the more well-defined planar oil/water interface by vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS). Classical molecular dynamics (MD) calculations coupled with density functional theory (DFT) methods will be employed to assist in spectral assignments and understanding solvation effects. Other experimental techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential and interfacial tensiometry will also be used. The proposed studies are a part of our long-term effort to understand the molecular properties of liquid surfaces in several exciting new directions. The program area that the studies address is experimental and theoretical investigations in condensed phase interfaces that elucidate the molecular-scale chemical and physical properties that govern the structuring and assembly of soft nanoparticles suspended in liquids."

In recent years, interest in research and development of superconducting quantum devices such as qubits for quantum computers has been expanding rapidly. Devices for Quantum Information Science (QIS) share a lot in common with detectors for these HEP experiments. They operate on microfabricated superconducting devices at sub-Kelvin temperature. High- energy radiation source, such as cosmic ray, has been identified as a source of error in superconducting quantum device, here we are proposing a way to engineer the environment the qubit sits to decouple from the bulk reducing the effect of the high energy phonons generated from cosmic rays. We propose to reduce cross section of superconducting quantum devices to cosmic rays by microfabricating a Micro- ElectroMechanical System (MEMS) structure that significantly reduces the interaction volume and ability for external phonons to propagate from the environment to the superconducting quantum device. Our approach will solve the joint optimization problem of minimizing phonon transport while maintaining superconducting electrical signal conductivity, mechanical sturdiness of the device and its mounting, and resonance quality of the superconducting device. We propose to develop an isolation structure to reduce cross section to cosmic ray interaction while preserving low loss dielectric structure that is required to fabricate QIS (and HEP detector) devices. Spider web bolometer sensor design was used widely by mm-wave to sub-mm wave astrophysics community. It was designed to thermally isolate a thermistor located at center of the spider web using silicon nitride membranes as a web medium. Spider structure was chosen for its structural strength as well as its small cross- section to cosmic rays. Our approach is to adapt this well-established MEMs technique for QIS devices to reduce its cross-section to cosmic rays. However, spider web bolometers used for astrophysics experiments have thermistors (NTD-Ge sensors or Transition Edge Sensors) and superconducting traces fabricated on silicon nitride membrane. QIS devices require superconducting resonators to be fabricated on low loss dielectric medium such as high resistivity silicon. We will suspend an island of high resistivity silicon with the spider web membranes such that superconducting resonators will be fabricated on the low loss medium. Spider web structure will be fabricated out of Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafer and low loss silicon nitride membrane. We will fabricate co-planar waveguide based superconducting resonator and Transition Edge Sensor on the isolated high resistivity silicon island. The resonator will be used to monitor quality factor of the system, while Transition Edge Sensor will be used to make detection of cosmic ray hit. By having both resonators and TES sensors on the same isolated island, it would be possible to make coincidence measurement to corelate cosmic ray event to quality factor of resonators. We will compare performance of the isolated system against unmitigated system to study its effectiveness. During Phase II of the program, we will then develop a process to fabricate high quality qubits in place of TES to demonstrate prolonged coherent time with this technique. The introduction of a high-quality qubit process will be directly applicable to the needs of quantum computing community and hence Seeqc and will greatly increase business opportunities to the industry in general."

Laser systems have been developed, that successfully produce ultrashort pulses at 0.8 mm, 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm wavelength either in solid-state or fiber laser architectures. Delivering ultrashort pulses in the mid-IR spectral region (l >3 mm) has however so far been possible via frequency down-conversion schemes that are typically bulky, lossy, and environment sensitive. There is however a great need for sources of stable, compact and turn-key ultrashort pulses in the mid-IR for a wide variety of applications ranging from spectroscopy of gases for industrial environment monitoring, spectroscopy of the next generation of quantum information materials, or to drive secondary sources such as e-beams relying on dielectric laser accelerators (DLA) or coherent soft X-rays based on high harmonic generation (HHG). In phase I of this project we will demonstrate a stable mid-IR platform that will deliver femtosecond pulses at 100 MHz repetition rate, sub-nJ to nJ energy at both 3 mm and 2 mm wavelength. Owing to the time and budget limitations of Phase I, the 3 mm pulses will be generated in a combined fiber/free space setting that will be used to design an all-fiber architecture. In phase II, the designed all-fiber approach will be implemented and the pulses at 2 mm and 3 mm wavelength will be scaled to the mJ energy level at kHz repetition rate. The system developed in phase I would find applications in mid-IR spectroscopy providing access – from a single box – to two long-wavelength spectral bands in a turn-key and robust architecture that can further be turned into a frequency comb. In addition, with limited further development, the energy of the 2 mm wave could be scaled and allow parametric amplification of the 3 mm wave, thereby producing an ultrabroadband 6 mm wave, precisely in the spectral range of rovibrational absorption band for a wide range of molecules. Further, the system delivered in Phase I would also make an ideal seed laser for 3 mm OPCPAs, an ideal driver for a secondary source of coherent soft x-ray radiation (200-1200 eV photon energy). Such secondary source would in turn allow spectroscopy on technologically relevant magnetic material and alloys with absorption in the 600-900 eV range, diffractive imaging with sub-5 nm resolution, a resolution range of high importance for the inspection of photolithography masks, or seed FELs."

These CACTI data are scientifically valuable not only for probing the growth of deep convection in this region, but also for studying the links between orographic and boundary-layer forcing mechanisms and convective outcomes (e.g., shallow versus deep cumuli). To this end, this proposal aims to gain insight into how variations in these forcings modulate the vigor, depth, and extent of convective clouds over the Sierras de Córdoba using a combination of observations and simulations. This will be accomplished by answering the following questions: 1. How do variations in thermal and mechanical forcing for ascent over the Sierras de Córdoba modulate convective outcomes during CACTI? 2. How predictable is regime-dependent orographic convection in modern atmospheric prediction models? The analyses used to answer these questions will include (a) classifying orographic forcing regimes and their convective outcomes from radar, satellite, radiosonde, and surface observations, (b) quantifying the impact of regime dependent sub-cloud and in-cloud processes on convective outcomes using boundary layer observations and cloud-layer entrainment retrievals, and (c) quantifying convective-scale predictability of CACTI events using ensembles numerical prediction experiments. In completing these tasks we will advance the understanding of orographic moist convection and, more broadly, contribute to ASR’s goals of understanding how cloud processes affect the Earth’s radiative balance and hydrological cycle, including processes that limit the predictive skill of regional and global models."
Droughts and deluges in semi-arid grassland ecosystems: Implications of co-occurring extremes for C cycling,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0022074,"Smith, Melinda",Melinda.Smith@coloradostateuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","The frequency of extreme climate perturbations including multi-year droughts and deluges (persistent, torrential rain events) is expected to increase with changing climate. Such climate extremes are known to have substantial impacts on ecosystems, but when these co-occur as compound climate extremes (e.g., deluges occur during droughts), their impacts are expected to exceed their independent effects. Although there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that droughts and deluges combined may lead to pulses or “hot moments” in carbon cycling processes, the ecosystem consequences of compound climate extremes are poorly known. The overall goal of our proposed research is to assess how co-occurring drought and deluge climate extremes will impact key carbon cycling processes known to be important for carbon-climate feedbacks. We will address this goal via research in the 280,000 km2 semi-arid shortgrass steppe ecoregion located at the western edge of the US Great Plains. Semi-arid regions, such as this one, respond strongly to precipitation extremes and play a dominant role in interannual variability of the global land CO2 sink. Our proposed research will test the hypothesis that when a compound climate perturbation of an extreme deluge occurring within the backdrop of extreme drought, a combination of conditions converge (e.g., warm temperatures, abundant soil moisture, and increased soil N availability) to strongly stimulate C cycle processes, potentially resulting in “hot moments” or landscape-level “hot spots” (i.e., increases in biogeochemical processes in time or space that far exceed background levels). To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a field experiment designed to quantify the magnitude of carbon cycling responses to drought and deluge events (independently and combined) and identify the underlying mechanisms resulting in positive drought-deluge interactions that can lead to hot moments of carbon cycling. Both above- and belowground C cycle responses to climate extremes will be quantified during this 3-yr experiment. To scale-up from the plot-level experiment to the shortgrass steppe ecoregion, we will use historical climate data to quantify the regional frequency of potential drought-deluge interactions and remote sensing products (NDVI and Solar Induced Fluorescence) to estimate carbon cycling sensitivity to droughts, deluges and their combined effects and to identify hot spots in carbon cycling regionally. Concurrent with these research activities, we will simulate extreme drought, deluge and drought-deluge perturbations with DOE’s E3SM Land Model (ELM). We will explicitly compare the experimental results and remotely sensed observations of drought-deluge compound climate perturbations to ELM simulations, with the expectation that the process-level understanding gained from our field experiment and remote sensing analyses can be used to constrain process representation and parameterization in ELM, and to improve Earth System projections of ecosystem carbon-cycling responses to droughts and deluges at the ecoregion scale. This proposed research will fill an important gap in empirical and modeling efforts to assess the effects of increasing compound perturbations forecast to occur with atmospheric warming – co-occurring extreme drought and deluge events – on key carbon cycling processes, and the role that compound extremes in precipitation may play in generating and sustaining biogeochemical “hot moments” and “hot spots”. Our ModEx approach will leverage and complement ongoing development of DOE’s state-of-the-art ELM model to further improve representation of above-belowground interactions and feedbacks for semi-arid ecosystems."

Boudouris, Purdue University (Principal Investigator) Brett M. Savoie, Purdue University (Co-Principal Investigator) Designing low-cost, high-performance materials for next-generation energy conversion and energy storage applications is of prime import as the energy portfolio of the United States trends towards new technologies. This effort speaks to this point in a unique manner by using a combined computational and experimental approach to address a less-studied group of materials known as radical polymers. These macromolecules have shown significant promise in applications where both electron and ion conduction are required (e.g., battery systems); however, contemporary efforts to explain fundamental structure-property-performance relationships have been limited to oft-used materials that may or may not be representative of the general scope, or ultimate limits, of radical polymers. Moreover, these relationships remain incompletely established because it has been difficult to control the nanoscale structure of these materials even though ordering at this length scale is crucial for both charge and ion conduction in these systems. Here, this fundamental gap is addressed by enabling the assembly of radical moieties to precisely control radical-radical couplings and macromolecular backbone interactions such that order can be introduced in a rational manner and at different scales. In this way, non-periodic, but nevertheless spatially-percolating radical networks (i.e., domains having local, but not long-range order), will be created, and their ability to govern charge and mass transport will be evaluated in a systematic manner. To achieve this overarching objective, high-throughput computational screening of novel open-shell chemistries will inform experimental syntheses by predicting the ultimate rate of charge transfer in these materials. This will lead to the evaluation of how new molecular motifs can be designed such that stable radicals will be created while still allowing for intimate contact and organization of open-shell groups. This will guide the experimental syntheses that will afford side chain liquid crystalline radical polymers (SCLC-RPs) that obtain local order (i.e., liquid crystalline order) and that can align on longer length scales upon application of an external stimulus. Subsequent evaluation of the charge and mass transport properties of these locally-ordered SCLC-RPs will allow for the creation of an appropriate descriptor for solid-state and electrolyte-supported transport in radical polymers. Through this combination of simulations and synthesis, there will be a dramatic expansion of the range of available radical polymer materials and an elucidation of the general design constructs for the field. It is anticipated that the fundamental scientific principles that are elucidated from the directed assembly of these next-generation liquid crystalline radical polymers will lead to thin film systems that have never-before-seen ionic and electronic conduction metrics."

However, the chemical processing of organic vapors occurring in clouds, and also their impact on cloud drop formation, remain key challenges for such models due to the inherent chemical complexity of aqueous-phase cloud chemistry, and the spatial and temporal scales over which such interactions with clouds take place. We will conduct a set of unique experiments and employ a hierarchical modeling approach to improve the parameterizations of cloud impacts on secondary organic aerosol formation. The proposed research leverages and extends principal investigator Thornton’s current project on the nature and multiphase chemistry of atmospheric oxidation products stemming from the biogenic volatile organic compound isoprene. This new project will specifically address two currently uncertain impacts of clouds upon the isoprene and monoterpene derived organic aerosol budget: 1) the role of shallow cumulus clouds in the production of organic aerosol particle mass from biogenic volatile organic compounds and 2) the role of deep convective clouds in transporting isoprene to the upper troposphere where it potentially contributes to new particle formation and growth. The overall goal of this project is to develop and test our process-level understanding using both experiment and a hierarchy of models to improve their representation in Department of Energy sponsored Earth system models. We will utilize a Lagrangian cloud parcel model with detailed microphysics and aqueous-phase organic chemistry, run along hundreds of trajectories output from large-eddy simulations of cumulus cloud fields. In addition, we will conduct new laboratory studies of aqueous phase partitioning and reactivity of a realistically broad suite of organic vapors produced by monoterpene and isoprene oxidation using a novel combination of continuous-flow simulation chamber output and an entrained droplet flow reactor to constrain this unique high-resolution modeling. We will then combine observationally constrained mechanistic descriptions of isoprene-derived organic aerosol formation developed from the principal investigator's current project, together with large eddy simulation driven ensemble parcel modeling of deep convective transport and chemistry. These simulations will be complemented by a unique set of simulation chamber experiments to explore the organic aerosol formation potential of low-temperature isoprene oxidation similar to conditions in land-based deep convection with lightning. The experimental data and detailed process-level model sensitivity studies will be used by collaborators to improve parameterizations in Department of Energy-supported models of biogenic volatile organic compound oxidation product reactivity in cloud water and the contribution of isoprene oxidation to new particle formation and growth in deep convective storm outflow. In this way, we will bridge the inherent complexity of cloud processing effects on the global biogenic organic aerosol budget."

L. Shaw, University of Rochester (Principal Investigator) D. H. Froula and J. Palastro, University of Rochester (Co-Investigators) By controlling the velocity of a focal spot propagating in a plasma, a wakefield can be driven at the speed of light. This simple concept and the enabling flying focus technology opens a new parameter space for studying laser-plasma accelerators and the basic physics principles that govern them. To understand the underlying physics of a dephasingless accelerator, a series of theoretical, computational, and experimental studies are required. Initially the physics of a dephasingless accelerator will be investigated through both theoretical scalings and laser-plasma interaction simulations. This work will study the physical tradeoffs between energy again, total accelerated charge, and beam quality. The science of an achromatic flying focus is a new area of research where the physics of a novel radial echelon coupled to an axiparabola will be explored to understand the limitations of the focal spot’s velocity trajectories and longitudinal focal length (accelerator length). A successful project will include a demonstration of a dephasingless flying-focus-driven laser-plasma accelerator where the fundamentals of particle trapping will be investigated. The achromatic flying focus is a new spatiotemporal focusing system similar to the original flying focus scheme that provides the ability to propagate a high-intensity pulse over meters at any velocity, while maintaining a small focal spot (<20 µm diam.) and short-pulse duration (transform limited). Conventional laser-wakefield accelerator approaches can accelerate electrons to high energies, but the maximum energy is constrained by the low plasma densities required to limit dephasing between the laser pulse and accelerated electrons. In our approach, the plasma density, and therefore the accelerating gradient for the electrons, is decoupled from the speed of the focal spot. Unlike conventional LWFA, where higher electron energy gain requires longer laser pulses to match the plasma wavelength set by the plasma density and increased laser energy to maintain high intensities, laser-plasma acceleration with a ""flying focus"" is ideally suited for the ultrashort pulse lasers of the future (100 J). Initial scaling with no dephasing between the laser pulse and accelerated electrons suggests that a 20 fs, 500 J laser would be capable of accelerating electrons to TeV energies with a single five-meter stage. High-Energy Physics colliders provide a window into the basic building blocks of the universe. As the energy gain from conventional radiofrequency accelerator technology begins to plateau, advanced accelerator concepts become the only way to push particle energies to new levels where the boundaries in the understanding of the universe can be expanded. The achromatic flying focus is an original concept that is a disruptive technology with the potential to transform the field of laser-plasma acceleration and more broadly advanced accelerators. This novel laser-plasma acceleration concept offers a paradigm shift in advanced accelerators that could push the frontiers of the field by decoupling the plasma conditions from the acceleration length and removing the need for a guiding structure. These studies are expected to open a new pathway to single-stage TeV accelerators."

These oxides strongly adsorb many biologically-relevant elements, including organic carbon and phosphate, as well as a wide range of metals including uranium and actinide species. Thus, the formation mechanisms of iron oxides are key to understanding both nutrient and metal contaminant cycling. Microorganisms can catalyze iron oxidation and promote the formation of iron biominerals but it is completely unknown how much of environmental iron oxidation is biologically-mediated versus abiotic. The overarching goal of our proposed work is to quantify and constrain microbial iron oxidation rates and gain insight into the controls on this process, toward an ultimate goal of integrating biotic iron oxidation into reactive transport models. The main challenge will be isolating the effects of iron oxidizing microorganisms from other competing mechanisms of iron oxidation. Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory project is to address this challenge in order to establish a clear path toward modeling environmental microbial iron oxidation. Our work focuses on the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, where microbial iron-oxidizers have been observed. At Tims Branch, part of the Argonne National Laboratory Wetland Hydrobiogeo-chemistry Science Focus Area (Argonne SFA), where groundwater discharges into a stream, extensive iron-oxidizing microbial mats form and appear to be a major sink of uranium. Pond B, part of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) BioGeoChemistry of Actinides SFA, is an actinide-impacted seasonally-stratified water body with iron oxidation at the chemocline, which may be due to Fe-oxidizers (based on culture evidence). Stratified ferruginous water bodies and iron mats are the most well-studied freshwater microbial iron-oxidizing systems, making the SRS an excellent field site for studying and comparing microbial iron oxidation processes in these two hydrogeochemical settings. Our approach will combine field perturbations and measurements, kinetics experiments on iron-oxidizing mats, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics coupled to metabolic modeling. Our objectives are to: Quantify biotic iron oxidation rates in a field setting and in iron microbial mat incubations. We will compare these rates to abiotic rates to determine the relative contributions of microbes. Identify and quantify dominant iron-oxidizing microorganisms and flanking community members at both SRS sites using genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics and integrate the results to identify trophic status and carbon utilization of dominant iron oxidizers. Construct metabolic models of a well-studied iron oxidizer and the most abundant and active iron-oxidizers and flanking organisms to establish linkages between microbial iron oxidation and carbon cycling. The collaborations between UD, Argonne and LLNL SFAs, and the University of Minnesota-led hydrogeochemistry project will allow us to take advantage of field operations, geochemical analyses, and hydrogeochemical observations from the locations that we plan to sample. Beyond these rates, a major outcome will be better protocols for obtaining reliable, replicable environmental biotic iron oxidation rates for use in modeling, and an understanding of controls on iron oxidation. We will also generate a new library of iron oxidizer metagenome-assembled genomes from both SRS sites, and by integrating with transcriptomic results, will be able to characterize the trophic status of major iron oxidizers and propose ecological linkages that connect Fe and C cycling. An additional outcome will be the first neutrophilic, iron-oxidizing bacteria metabolic model with validation (Sideroxydans lithotrophicus ES-1) and initial consortia-style metabolic models of iron-oxidizing communities, which will yield testable hypotheses and clear next steps for refining metabolic models for integration into watershed scale models. This work sets the stage for our longer-term goal to link iron oxidizer metabolic models and kinetics to biogeochemical/hydrological models to predict iron, carbon, nutrient and contaminant metal cycling effects."

In turn, this processing is governed by a variety of abiotic and biotic interactions involving, e.g., the type of rock that governs geomorphology and mineralization and the type of vegetation that can generate acidity. The proposed work will focus on the role of vegetation as a means to influence water chemistry and quality. By employing a multi-scale approach, the project will address the following questions: 1) Does landscape-scale heterogeneity in vegetation, climate, and geology impart unique, spatially-variable signatures on soil production and chemical weathering rates? 2) What roles do the legacies of Pleistocene glaciation and Holocene geomorphic processes play in determining modern-day solute concentrations in surface waters? 3) Are physical erosion and chemical weathering rates linked at the watershed scale, and can these rates be predicted from watershed characteristics? These questions will be addressed in the physical and ecological setting of the East River watershed near Crested Butte, Colorado. The proposed technical approach will assess controls on weathering and solute generation at the soil profile, landform, and watershed scales. At the soil profile scale, soil production and chemical weathering rates will be quantified with cosmogenic nuclides and geochemical mass balance at sites that span biotic, climatic, and geologic gradients in order to isolate the key drivers of chemical weathering. At the landform scale, solute concentrations in surface waters will be used to assess whether surficial deposits generated by different geomorphic processes impart unique weathering signatures. At the watershed-scale, cosmogenic nuclides will be used to measure erosion rates. A series of reactive transport models will be constructed to place the field-based findings into a framework for making predictions regarding the roles that vegetation, climate, and geomorphology play in solute generation.

Effects of Rapid Permafrost Thaw on CO2 and CH4 Fluxes in a Warmer and Wetter Future,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019063,"Neumann, Rebecca",Rebecca.Neumann@universityofwashington,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Our primary object is to improve environmental predictability by advancing understanding of how carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) flux in permafrost thaw-induced wetlands (thermokarst) will change in the future. Northern latitudes are expected to get warmer and wetter, leading to increased thermokarst thaw both in places already thawing, and in places where the permafrost is currently stable. Understanding the land-atmosphere exchange of these important greenhouse gases will help us understand and predict environmental change. Data previously collected by the research team showed that CO2 uptake and CH4 emission by a thermokarst bog in Alaska increased in rainy years. The increase in CH4 emission was not associated with wetter soils, as is often assumed. Rather, rain carried heat from the atmosphere into the bog, warming peat to deep depths. Warmer peat temperatures supported plant growth within recently thawed areas of the bog, which increased net CO2 uptake and fueled CH4 production and emission within these areas. Plant growth within older thaw areas minimally responded to the increased temperatures. We hypothesize the difference in plant response between young and old thaw areas was associated with nitrogen availability, a key plant nutrient which is more available in young thaw areas. These data imply that the formation of thermokarst wetlands will have dynamic effects on the climate system. Net carbon flux and CH4 emissions will change not only as thawed landscapes age, but also as environmental conditions shift. Capturing and correctly accounting for dynamic biosphere&ndash;atmosphere interactions and feedbacks, such as those involved with permafrost thaw, requires Earth system modeling. However, current Earth system land models, like the Energy Exascale Earth System Model Land Model (ELM), do not include transport of heat into soil from rain, do not represent sub-grid heterogeneity of land units (e.g., differently aged wetlands), do not fully represent soil nitrogen processing and plant nitrogen uptake, and do not explicitly connect plant productivity with CH4 production. These deficiencies undermine the accuracy and precision of the model and reduce its predictive capability. We will take a coupled model-experiment-observation approach to advance understanding of thermokarst wetland dynamics and to address these deficiencies in ELM. We have six specific aims: 1. Harness historical data to identify how the amount and timing of rainfall affects peat temperature, nitrogen dynamics, plant productivity, and carbon flux in thermokarst wetlands. 2. Conduct a field manipulation experiment to test our underlying hypothesis that the organic nitrogen content of peat within young and old wetland areas controls the different responses of these areas to rainfall by affecting the production of plant-available nitrogen. 3. Determine how wetland dynamics will change in the future by measuring peat temperatures, vegetation coverage, and carbon flux in differently aged areas of an isolated thawing permafrost bog located in a currently warm and wet climate (i.e., on the Kenai Peninsula). 4. Advance ELM &rsquo;s soil thermal-hydrology-biogeochemistry coupling by adding advective heat transport into soil by rain, improving representation of soil nitrogen dynamics, and directly connecting plant productivity with CH4 production. 5. Use field data to parameterize the improved ELM, identify model uncertainty, and use the model to conduct site-level experiments that test hypotheses. 6. Extrapolate the model to northern permafrost region and simulate future CO2 and CH4 fluxes with different climate forcings and wetland-age projections. Enhance understanding of key interactions and feedback mechanisms that affect thermokarst wetland carbon fluxes. These efforts will improve knowledge and thus representation of coupled thermal-hydrological-biogeochemical processes within ELM, increasing knowledge of climate&ndash;carbon feedbacks and progressing environmental predictability."
Control of Light-Matter Interactions in Hybrid Structured Environments with Novel Nanomaterials of Different Dimensionalities,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0010697,"Malko, Anton",Anton.Malko@theuniversityoftexasatdallas,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","The rich photophysics of novel semiconductors like transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and lead halide perovskites (LHPs) can be gainfully exploited in integrated photonic structures alongside with conventional semiconducting and dielectric materials. The judicious integration of nanocrystals (NCs) and other components in a single hybrid structure may in fact represent transformative opportunities in optoelectronics, nanophotonics and energy harvesting wherein new and improved functionalities can be achieved synergistically. After the absorption of photons, for instance, the resulting excitons in NCs can be converted into photonic and polaritonic modes that would not be coupled to original photons. The frequency downconversion between different NC emitters can be facilitated as well as energy transfer from excitons and multiexcitons into semiconducting substrates. On the other hand, incorporation of TMD layers and their patterns can be used to increase the light energy harvesting and enable functionalities of the integrated photonics. Photoinduced modulation of TMD properties promises the opportunity of all-optical control of such integrated assemblies. Realization of the prospects of the integrated hybrid structures, however, crucially depends on the ability to fabricate these &ldquo;designer&rdquo; assemblies without compromising, better yet enhancing the desired properties of individual components. Even precise positioning of the NCs within the structures would be insufficient if accompanied by a substantial reduction of their emission. Likewise, accurate patterning of TMD layers would not lead to desired effects if accompanied by uncontrollable defect formation. Proper encapsulation and passivation of the defects within the structure itself must therefore be addressed and resolved in order to minimize the energy losses to parasitic processes. Then it will be possible to better understand and utilize the intrinsic fundamental properties of the novel nanomaterials and fully benefit from their integration via control of energy flows and exciton-photon interconversions. In our earlier work, we developed a modified ALD/CVD deposition of aluminum oxide that could efficiently passivate some types of nanocrystals in retaining and even improving their emissive properties. We were also able to use a sequential assembly technique to grow NC multilayers with precise placement of each layer accompanied by the spectroscopic evolution of excitons. We observed energy transfer from excitons and multiexcitons in NCs into Si and TMD substrates. These and other advances point to a promising versatile way to protect and enhance optical properties of NC emitters while naturally growing spatially extended structures with the help of metal oxides. This project will pursue the creation of such hybrid photonic structures that could take advantage of enhanced near-field and radiative interactions in waveguiding and microcavity configurations with the longer-term goal of achieving control of light-matter coupling in such systems. Our research will be based on synergistic studies of fundamental structural, chemical, optical and electrical properties of hybrid components and structures, whose analysis would be supported by theoretical modeling. It will address a variety of questions pertinent to the main goal, such as: Can the modified oxide deposition technique be applied to various nanoemitters and 2D materials to fabricate optically-robust structures? Can perovskite NCs with desired optical properties be processed and incorporated to maintain these properties? Can defect and impurity states in 2D layers and their patterns be controlled or engineered for integration? Which experimental probes of extended hybrids will better elucidate their relation to the composition and fundamental properties of the excitonic (matter) and photonic (light) counterparts? The comprehensive approach we propose should provide a comprehensive insight into the opportunities, challenges and practical viability of integrated assemblies with novel semiconductors as a material platform for optoelectronic and photonic devices with new and improved functionalities."

The accuracy goal for thermochemical quantities, e.g., bond dissociation energies, heats of formation, ionization potentials, etc., is 1-3 kcal/mol. These studies are based on extensions to the Feller-Peterson-Dixon composite approach, which hinges on recovering all important contributions to thermochemical quantities as accurately as possible. Highly correlated wavefunction-based approaches are employed, with a series of correlation consistent basis sets that allow for extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. Contributions due to outer-core electron correlation, scalar and spin-orbit relativistic effects, leading quantum electrodynamic contributions (Lamb shift), and of course zero-point vibrational and thermal corrections are then considered. This systematic approach allows for the unambiguous assessment of the accuracy of various quantum chemical methods for these difficult f-block systems, leading to increased confidence when predicting properties of new and novel species, as well as an improved understanding of the role of f electrons in structure and reactivity. There are two main focus areas of the present proposed work: (i) develop the computational tools (basis sets) and methodologies (FPD) needed by the community to carry out reliable and if desired, accurate, computational studies of molecular systems involving heavy elements, particularly actinides, and (ii) carry out high quality quantum chemistry applications involving heavy element chemistry to not only demonstrate the efficacy of these methods but also address problems of interest to the heavy element community, namely the thermodynamics and spectroscopy of f-element molecules as well as the role of f-electrons in bonding. Applications will include benchmarking new correlation methods, determining the high ionization potentials and first electron affinities of actinide atoms, and continuing to calculate chemically accurate thermochemical quantities for molecules containing actinides, including metalloactinyls involving 5d metals, as well as predicting the spectroscopic properties of small prototypical actinide molecules involving U-N, U-X (X=halogen), and U-O bonds."

The project will develop cutting-edge trustworthy deep learning algorithms, together with the next-generation machine learning-based scientific simulation toolkits for accelerating and enhancing the ultra-large-scale scientific simulation. The project consists of a few interconnected core tasks, including developing adversarially robust deep learning algorithm, accelerating the training of deep nets, enhancing the performance of deep nets, reducing the inference time and energy consumption of deep learning, quantifying the uncertainties, and improving the efficiency of physics-informed deep nets for simulating multiscale scientific problems. Our approach towards TPiDL comprises (1) Algorithm Development Thrust and (2) Scientific Computing Application Thrust. The modern partial differential equations and optimization theory integrated with physical prior will be the underpinning theoretical foundation of TPiDL. (1) The proposed Algorithm Development thrust includes leveraging adaptive momentum from the Nesterov accelerated gradient to accelerate the convergence of stochastic gradient descent with theoretical guarantees; unifying the theory of optimal control of transport equations with the practice of training and testing of ResNets; studying the efficient architecture and deep nets compression algorithm co-design, and developing a probabilistic physics-informed multiscale deep net.

We will pursue this by focusing on a novel class of “patchy” metallic nanoparticles (NPs). These particles exhibit spatially discrete surface domains, akin to proteins. The surface heterogeneity can lead to directional interactions and a force imbalance that allows engineering of equilibrium self-assembly, out-of-equilibrium motility, and collective behaviors on length scales that so far have seen limited realization and characterization. We will integrate advances in synthesis of patchy NPs, liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, and algorithms for many-body interactions into a framework for electrokinetic modeling and customized motion analysis. Our primary goals are to understand the working mechanisms of patchy “machines” on the nanoscale and organize them into patterns that vary over space and time. These so-called active materials can change their form and function as needed. Our inspiration comes from the observation that cyclic patterns underly most systems in nature that perform useful work, yet their realization in man-made materials that are reconfigurable on the nanoscale is extremely limited. The ability to undergo cooperative transitions in morphology will provide new opportunities for controlling processes such as mass and energy transport—in contrast, most synthetic materials exhibit only a single form and perform limited functions throughout their performance lifespan. The experimental–simulation collaboration also appeals to the mission of broader scientific endeavors, such as the Materials Genome Initiative, bringing this approach to a regime which has historically been a challenge for soft materials."

For the majority of plant genes, knowledge of their function, especially the association of gene to phenotype, remains stubbornly incomplete despite focused efforts by the plant research community. This proposal focuses on the biofuel trait of seed oil synthesis as a proof of concept for an approach developed that is extensible to any agronomic/biofuel trait of interest. For a given trait of interest, we predict novel TF regulators by leveraging the power of large expression data sets in a model species and then translate that knowledge to a target biofuel species for immediate benefit to the DOE mission. Two of the principal challenges in determining gene function are: 1. Subtle phenotypes that occur in organ and/or developmental stage specific manner and 2. Functional redundancy among gene family members masks phenotypic effects via genetic or dosage compensation. In this project, we will develop a general approach that addresses these two major concerns by focusing on regulation of a biological process of interest (e.g., lipid biosynthesis) in an organ specific manner (e.g., in seeds) and by estimating the likelihood of a given TF being redundant in its function (Aim 1). We will validate our functional predictions, using transgenic lines (Aim 2), via phenotypic assays (Aim 3a) and by identifying the specific target genes these TFs regulate (Aim 3b). Finally, we translate the validated TF regulation knowledge gained in a model species (Arabidopsis thaliana) to biofuel crops (e.g., Camelina sativa) (Aim 4). Outcome:This DOE project focuses on the seed lipid biosynthesis trait as a proof-of-concept and aims to identify multiple novel regulators of this trait. The data and algorithms developed in this project should prove valuable to any research group interested in discovering novel TF regulators of any plant process. This project provides the data and tools to discover such regulators in the model plant Arabidopsis as well as a computational pipeline to translate the knowledge gained in Arabidopsis to a biofuel species."

Vermerris, U. of Florida (Co-Investigator) Plant-derived production of renewable fuels and chemicals has the potential to enhance US farming and agricultural economic opportunities, increase domestic energy security, and reduce fossil fuel dependency and greenhouse gas emissions. Realizing the potential of these alternative energy sources necessitates the development of high-biomass-yielding crops. These specialized crop varieties may harbor modifications to cell walls, which are a major barrier to pathogen entry, and to the tissue distribution of sugars, which are the pathogen&rsquo;s food source; hence they are likely to present previously unseen challenges for disease resistance. Over the last several years, disease from the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas, has caused significant yield losses in many crops where bacterial diseases had historically been rare, including corn and cotton. It is currently unclear why these diseases are emerging. Xanthomonas is a known pathogen of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), though similar to corn and cotton, the incidence and impact of the disease has historically been low. Taken together, these observations highlight a vulnerability in sorghum&rsquo;s resilience to pathogens that is likely to be magnified by alterations in cell wall and sugar content. We establish the sorghum &ndash; Xanthomonas pathosystem as a model for deducing how latent microbial pathogens might exploit key biofuel crop traits through three specific objectives. In Objective 1 we will quantitatively model the disease triangle that describes sorghum, pathogenic bacteria, and the environment. Field and laboratory experiments will be combined to determine bacterial susceptibility of genetically diverse sorghum genotypes that differ in cell wall and sugar composition. Standard plant pathology techniques combined with powerful phenomics approaches will provide a holistic view of this pathosystem within variable environments. Further, transcriptomics will be employed to elucidate mechanisms used by bacterial pathogens to induce sorghum susceptibility. Microbial pathogens are known to manipulate the sugar and cell wall characteristics of their hosts. Consequently, under Objectives 2 and 3 these characteristics will be analyzed during pathogen invasion. This research will reveal the mechanisms underlying tolerance to pathogens that must be maintained during biofuel trait optimization. The proposed research will yield a detailed understanding of the impact of bioenergy relevant traits on pathogen susceptibility. This is a necessary first step towards the development of novel routes for disease control that can be deployed in parallel with targeted alterations to sugar and cell wall composition during bioenergy crop improvement and breeding efforts. This research leverages several ongoing DOE-funded projects to maximize impact and relevance, while also adding a critically important new dimension to the overall goal of developing environmentally sound renewable energy sources."

The mechanisms responsible for accelerating electrons that precipitate onto the ionosphere are not fully understood. For more than three decades, particle interactions with Alfven waves have been proposed as a possible means for accelerating electrons and generating aurorae. Due to the limitations of spacecraft conjunction studies and other multi-spacecraft approaches, it is highly unlikely, through spacecraft observations alone, to confirm definitively the proposed electron acceleration mechanism by making simultaneous measurements of both the accelerated electrons and the inertial Alfven wave responsible for the acceleration. Laboratory investigations have not been successful because wave-particle interactions with the small populations in the tail of the distribution function are difficult to observe with traditional methods. Using a novel Whistler Wave Absorption Diagnostic, laboratory experiments will be performed on the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at UCLA to measure precisely the effect of inertial Alfven waves on the tail of the electron distribution function, with the aim to verify definitively the acceleration of electrons by inertial Alfven waves.

We will conduct testing including corrosion in high-temperature molten salts, aging, and thermo-mechanical loading. We will conclude Phase II by demonstrating a manufacturing path to component production with corrosion-resistant cladding. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: The adoption of new Generation IV nuclear reactors has the potential to make nuclear energy safer, more efficient, and able to produce less nuclear waste than current nuclear reactors.

Reconfigurable circuits are made of logic devices whose input-output mapping can be transformed in real-time, which means that the same circuit can be used to implement various logic functions with small device usage. It enables a higher computation density and lower cost and area, which is excellent for a wide range of applications from the high-performance data center to low-power portable devices. The rapid discovery of emerging reconfigurable device technologies also opens a new path toward an energy-efficient reconfigurable hardware paradigm to facilitate low-power logic circuits thanks to the unique device-level physics behavior. However, there is still a big question of “how to fully utilize reconfigurable devices to enable efficient reconfigurable circuits?” Limited research has been performed to take advantage of these emerging devices to realize large-scale reconfigurable circuits. A fundamental rethinking is needed to establish a comprehensive design methodology to efficiently obtain the true potential of emerging reconfigurable technologies in the early design and exploration stage. The goal of this proposal is to use a synergistic device-circuit-synthesis co-optimization approach to (i) develop novel synthesis solutions to enable large-scale reconfigurable circuits and (ii) adapt the synthesizer to leverage emerging compact and energy-efficient reconfigurable logic devices.

The heterogeneous nature of Earth’s crust, which leads to non-uniform stress states and complex fault systems, is often cited as a major impediment in interpreting field results, assessing seismic risk, or even one day, predicting the occurrence of earthquakes. Despite these challenges, recent work at the laboratory scale shows that machine learning (ML) algorithms can successfully predict the timing and magnitude of laboratory quakes using radiated ultrasonic waves that emanate from the faults (equivalent to seismic waves in nature). Existing studies show that laboratory quakes are preceded by systematic changes in wave properties. Inspired by these new developments, the first objective of the proposed work is to reveal the underlying physics that allows ML-based prediction of laboratory quakes. In the long term, advanced ML models – if generalizable – could provide a pathway to improving seismic risk assessment (or even predicting earthquakes) in nature. In the short- to medium-term, the use of advanced ML models in laboratory settings – where large datasets under well-constrained conditions are readily available – represents a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of earthquake physics and in turn, better understand why/how the reported predictions work. Here, I propose to build a ML framework informed by current knowledge on constitutive laws governing frictional instability. If successful, the proposed physics-informed ML framework would require less training data for equally good predictions, and make predictions more generalizable, for instance when tested outside the bounds of the training set (e.g., for real earthquakes). The second objective of the proposed work is to illuminate the role of fault heterogeneity and off-fault rock damage. High-resolution imaging of laboratory-scale faults, through the use of dense arrays of ultrasonic sensors and in combination with the physics-informed ML framework, will allow us to visualize the mechanics of earthquake nucleation and to build process-based models that connect pre-seismic activity (or lack of) to the precursory changes in wave velocity/attenuation occurring on the fault plane and surrounding host rock, in relation with heterogeneity on the fault plane. In sum, the combination of physics-informed ML models with high resolution imaging of laboratory faults will provide a physical basis that can in turn improve our interpretation of field observations as well as inform future use of ML approaches in the field.

In order to predict the behavior of these systems for desired outcomes, a deep understanding and measuring of cellular and molecular-scale events is required, such as can be provided by precision imaging tools. Inherent to biological imaging, however, is a tradeoff between maintaining integrity of the biosystem and simultaneously extracting useful information through imaging. This is especially evident for live cell imaging studies in which the duration and frequency of high intensity light exposure must be adjusted to minimize photodamage or altering the function of the system under study. Quantum science and technology has the potential to revolutionize biological microscopy to provide noninvasive and nondestructive imaging of plant and microbial systems. The overarching goal of this proposal is to advance simultaneously the experimental and theoretical potential of entangled two-photon fluorescence microscopy as a new approach to ultralow light bioimaging. The proposed research includes a unique combination of novel technical innovations and quantum light developments, fundamental understanding and theoretical predictions, as well as validation of the novel imaging capabilities through probing complex biosystems in the rhizosphere. The optical development work will be heavily focused on dispersion compensation and adaptive pulse shaping of entangled photon pairs. The theoretical work will be centered on attaining fundamental understanding and providing structure-function relationships for the entangled two-photon absorption properties of complex biomolecules such as the flavoprotein system iLOV. Simultaneously, the biological studies will undertake systematic measurements to quantitatively assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression in complex biosystems in the rhizosphere. This will involve constructing iLOV transcriptional reporters in plant-associated bacteria and imaging gene expression in complex biological systems using the entangled two-photon fluorescence microscopy. This innovation in bioimaging will allow for truly ultralow light levels to be used in experiments to improve our fundamental understanding of the complex biological processes that underpin nutrient cycling and sustainable production of bioenergy sources."

Unfortunately, the development and testing of such application software now faces many serious productivity crises brought about by the increased use of heterogeneity. In practical terms, extreme heterogeneity implies the use of CPUs, GPUs and accelerators from different manufacturers, alternatives to traditional IEEE number representations, and compilers and numerical libraries that employ new instruction sets and computational units such as Tensor Cores. These changes have both fundamental and pervasive impact throughout the software stack. They affect the behavior of a number of aspects of today’s HPC software, throwing today’s software testing methods for HPC completely off-track. This proposal is on new testing methods that not only help restore order but stay relevant despite the continued growth of heterogeneity. The specific focus of our work is on numerical correctness. In their quest to reduce data movement costs, designers of modern HPC systems have embraced different lower precision arithmetic schemes that are supported by a plethora of computing substrates and compilers. Amidst these flurry of changes, even a simple step such as a compiler upgrade can cause significant ripple effects in terms of numerical result aberrations. Often, expert human intervention is needed to repair the situation. Work in the ComPort project will approach these challenges under four thrusts. The first, Testing for Reusable and Composable Software Development, will develop component interface characterization methods that lead to testing efficiency. Work under this thrust will not only enhance the coverage of all important facets of a components’ behavior but also avoid wasting testing cycles by repeatedly covering scenarios previously seen. Testing for Portability and Automation-assistance is the second thrust of ComPort. Upon encountering numerical errors, a number of correction strategies must be manually employed: changing the compiler optimization flags; using extra precision (deduced through manual reasoning) for selected variables; and even selective rewrite of code to real-number equivalent alternate forms that help lower the rounding error. This thrust will explore methods to automatically carry out such repairs. It will also develop methods to ensure numerical correctness portability when performance portability frameworks such as Kokkos and RAJA are employed. Testing/Monitoring for Inputs and Runtime Behavior is the third thrust of ComPort. Software components have long lives, and hence must be adjusted over time to operate under different circumstances. Not only have the parallel programming models become richer, the components may be subject to new input ranges, and may be run on hardware whose specifications also evolve over time. Testing methods must stay nimble to these changes. Our work will employ various runtime monitoring methods both to detect the onset of problems, and to glean facts (e.g., value intervals seen) that can be recorded in a components’ interface to help minimize test coverage duplication. Test Feedback and User Actionability is the fourth and final thrust of ComPort. Test management is a complex problem given the sheer number of parameters (problem sizes, machine parameters, problem parameters, runtime flag options, minibatch sizes, etc.) that fly about. We will automate the mining of relationships between these system parameters. When failures occur, we will provide higher-level feedback as well as enable high-level actionability. The research of this project will be carried out over three years through collaboration between universities and DOE labs. Its development will be driven by various Exascale Computing Proxy-Applications. At the end of three years, the ComPort testing framework will be demonstrated on two non-trivial actual applications. Publications and student/postdoc training will be additional outcomes in addition to the release of versions of ComPort after each of the three years."
Metal Organic Frameworks for Noble Gas Isotope Harvesting at FRIB,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0020987,"Severin, Gregory",Gregory.Severin@michiganstateuniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Metal Organic Frameworks for Noble Gas Isotope Harvesting at FRIB Ate Visser (LEAD-PI), Gregory Severin (Michigan State University, CO-PI) Objectives Noble gas isotopes like 211Rn and 76Kr are produced at FRIB and generators for 211At and 76Br in nuclear medicine applications. Several critical knowledge gaps need to be addressed before noble gas isotope harvesting at FRIB is a reality. The objective of this project is to generate this knowledge, demonstrate 76Kr harvesting at NSCL and enable the design of the gas-phase isotope harvesting system at FRIB. Project Description Our work will be divided into three phases: Synthesis, Laboratory Testing, and Pilot Collection. The first phase, Synthesis, will routinize the synthesis and quality control of MOFs. We will search MOF libraries for Rn-specific and Kr-specific MOFs. We will synthesize MOF material and characterize the structure by XRD. In the second phase, Laboratory Testing, the MOFs will be subjected to breakthrough tests with atmospheric Kr and 222Rn using LLNL noble-gas mass-spectrometry facilities, and in-line low-level Rn detection equipment. The Pilot Collection phase will occur at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) using the new water-filled beam-blocker as a source for heavy-ion fragmentation products. Methods Because of their crystalline nature, the MOFs materials can be readily characterized by routine powder X-ray diffraction. Adsorption experiments will be monitored by real-time noble gas mass spectrometry and 222Rn decay counting. In addition to low level sorption characteristics, state-of-the-art gravimetric sorption analyzers will be employed to fully characterize the synthesized materials. The best-performing MOFs from the previous testing and synthesis phases will be arranged in a gas purification system at NSCL. The radioactivity will be monitored with a series of cesium fluoride and lanthanum bromide detectors to compare the quantities of various isotopes along the trap series. Impact The results of this project enable the design of the gas-phase isotope harvesting system at FRIB. Once the capability for noble gas isotope harvesting has been established, other gaseous isotopes that are in short supply can be considered for harvesting using gained experiences. Astrophysical and stockpile stewardship sciences have an interest in other isotopes of krypton, as well as xenon. The techniques we will develop for krypton and radon are not isotope specific and therefor applicable for harvesting other isotopes of krypton and xenon at FRIB. The same technology will be applicable to collecting valuable isotopes from other isotope production facilities, such as Rn that can be evolved from 232Th target processing at BNL. The MOF technology has the potential to scrub the exhaust stream from solid-target workups and either capture valuable isotopes or limit radiological releases. For example, Xe trapping will assist facilities that are investigating isotope production from fission targets, where Xe releases are often difficult to control."

There is an acute need in this field to select individual particle bunches from within a beam and “kick” them onto a different trajectory using pulsed electromagnetic fields. The time frames associated with these operations can be too brief for semiconductor switches that require several nanoseconds to turn on, and several nanoseconds to turn off. This SBIR project is investigating a new approach to create brief kicking pulses by superimposing harmonic radio waves within a harmonically resonant kicking cavity. Two types of fast multi-harmonic kicker cavities are being developed by our collaboration. One will produce transverse kicks at 86.6 MHz and one will produce longitudinal kicks at 499 MHz. The transverse kicker will directly influence the trajectory of bunches within the beam, and the longitudinal kicker will use magnetic separation of selectively boosted bunches. This ultimate goal of this SBIR is to experimentally evaluate both kicking solutions on a beamline. The Phase I project, and efforts at Jlab, have established a solid foundation for achieving this goal. A beamline compatible transverse cavity is currently being assembled, once complete; it is ready for beamline evaluation at the start of Phase II. This is because its high power harmonic driver, originally a Phase II goal, was completed in Phase I. Phase I also developed longitudinal kicker cavities, a high power harmonic combiner technology, and a new type of harmonic synthesizer. Phase II will begin with beamline testing of the 86.6 MHz transverse kicker. A vacuum compatible longitudinal kicker cavity and its high power harmonic driver will be constructed and also beamline tested during Phase II. This new kicking technology has immediate and future needs in particle acceleration, including at Fermilab’s Project X where protons could be sent to several experiments simultaneously, and at the LCLS at SLAC where fast beam switching kickers could be used to operate multiple wigglers at near CW repetition rates. The fast drivers under development are also compatible with existing and future stripline type kickers. Fast arbitrary waveform generators have applications in communications and radar."

Winkler (U. Washington) Co-PIs: L. Chistoserdova, D.A. Stahl, and S Bryson (U. Washington), C. Pan (U. Oklahoma), X. Mayali (LLNL) This collaborative project takes advantage of expertise in four disciplines (biological process engineering, mathematical modeling, sediment microbiology, and omics driven science) to implement a game-changing technological approach to link the physiology of individual wetland microbial cells to larger mesoscale ecosystem processes. The encapsulation of naturally resident microbiota in hydrogel particles (called biogranules) of different sizes provides a format that closely replicates natural diffusion-limited processes, and the entrapment allows the system to experience extremes of imposed environmental conditions without community washout. Native communities entrapped in a novel biogranule format (i.e., biogranule column mesocosms) will be used to examine how anticipated climate-related changes in wetland habitats will impact biogeochemical activities in different redox zones at different scales of resolution, from the functional roles of individual cells, to interacting populations, and to system-level processes. Specifically, the proposed research will quantify the impact of climate change stressors on model wetland microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they sustain through the integration of mathematical modeling and highly controlled hydrogel column experiments. This experimental design provides for both a system-level analysis (by continuous sampling of net fixation and release of gaseous microbial excretion products) and a coincident fine scale analysis of the supporting microbiology using NanoSIMS paired with FISH, metagenomics, and Proteomic Stable Isotope Probing. This research will use highly automated column mesocosms to mimic natural wetland conditions by closely simulating their chemical, thermal and physical gradients. We will specifically investigate how predicted climate change-associated stressors impact the microbial populations of two wetland systems. Lacustrine wetlands are known to be impacted by lower rainfall and warmer temperature leading to more frequent drought events and therefore to lower above-ground productivity and higher below-ground oxygen exposure. In our experiments we will mimic this scenario by changing the availability of oxygen to test the impact on anaerobic respiratory processes, alterations of the microbial community structure, net metabolic rates, and transformations / partitioning of carbon and nitrogen including the stepwise conversion of intermediates (NO2-NO-N2O-N2) in the denitrification pathway. Estuarine wetlands are expected to be impacted by saltwater intrusion due to sea level rise, which will shift the microbial community from methanogenesis towards sulfate reduction at a specific salt concentration (which we will experimentally alter). In both wetlands we will trace how carbon mineralization rates will vary as a function of the different redox zones, local microbial functional guild structures, and the forms of available organic carbon. We will infuse the hydrogel biogranule community with a mixture of organic carbon polymers designed to approximate plant fiber composition (cellulose, xylan, lignin, and pectin), providing for the controlled and stable microbial contact required for hydrolysis and metabolism of these complex carbon sources. Stable isotope labeling with 15N-labeled ammonium in combination with NanoSIMS will be used to assess changing activities with depth in the individual hydrogel grains, and in relation to varying redox zones of the mesocosm system. Organism-specific activity profiles will be inferred by combined metagenomic and proteomic SIP analyses, and validated by more selective NanoSIMS analysis of carbon mineralization using 13C-labeled intermediates of polymer degradation (coniferyl alcohol, glucose, acetate, CH4, and CO2) to resolve patterns of activity distribution and possible metabolic interactions among individual organisms and populations. This experimental format offers a unique way to bridge different biological scales, linking single-cell scale measurements (with NanoSIMS and FISH) to population scale (with metagenomics and Proteomic SIP), to the ecosystem scale (with biogeochemical flux measurements) to inform global scale mathematical models. The system response to imposed perturbations will be used for iterative modeling. Particle-level transformations will serve to both model and predict net C and N conversions, which should be consistent with measured net capture and release of CO2/CH4 from the column system and activities identified by proteomic SIP. These microscale models may contribute to more robust large-scale models and to project future climate-related changes in wetland processes."

The projects focus on the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) description for the electrons, in conjunction with mixed quantum-classical methods for coupled electron-ion motion derived from the recent exact factorization approach. More accurate non-empirical exchange-correlation functionals will be developed from first-principles for the simulation of real-time electron dynamics in non-equilibrium situations, correcting deficiencies of functionals used today. The new methods for the treatment of coupled electron and ion dynamics incorporate wavepacket splitting, electronic relaxation and decoherence, as well as essential nuclear quantum effects in a more theoretically sound way than current methods do. In modeling the electronic structure and dynamics of solar cells, TDDFT is the favored quantum mechanical method due to its system-size scaling. However, (i) the exchange-correlation functionals in use today lack known features of the exact functionals that are particularly important when the electronic system is excited out of its ground-state. This impacts their ability to accurately and reliably describe processes in solar energy conversion, especially charge-transfer dynamics and level alignment. Further, (ii) the usual treatments in coupling electrons to nuclei are either qualitatively inadequate in their description of electron-nuclear correlation (Ehrenfest), or suffer from over-coherence (surface-hopping) for which a consistent solution has remained elusive. An ab initio approach to the electron-ion coupling problem would lead to greater reliability. The project develops new methods, based on first-principles, that confront these problems. For (i), we focus on developing practical memory-dependent functional approximations derived from an exact expression for the time-dependent exchange-correlation potential. How initial-state-dependence can be used to simplify the approximations will be explored. We will also implement an exact condition that we recently derived, that prevents spuriously detuned resonances. The spurious detuning plagues approximate functionals in use today when the electronic system has evolved far from its ground-state, and impacts level alignment after photoexcitation and the ensuing charge-transfer dynamics. For (ii), we will develop new coupled-dynamics methods based on the exact factorization (EF) approach. In one direction, we will modify a recently-proposed mixed quantum-classical algorithm building on features we have identified from our recent deconstruction of this method. We will include nuclear quantum effects on light nuclei through a semiclassical generalization of the algorithm. In another direction, we will formulate and test a non-adiabatic single-surface EF-based mixed quantum-classical method, that avoids any expansion in Born-Oppenheimer states. Success of the project will yield accurate, practical, and predictive methods, sound in their basic theory, to model electron and nuclear dynamics in solar energy conversion. The ultimate goal is to use these tools for the computational design of new materials for solar cell devices of high efficiency."

However, HPC ecosystems consist of diverse components, e.g., architectures, programming models, and system software. Failure to consider how parameters at the user-, software-, and facility-level interact when running these simulations can delay the scientific return or leave these billion-dollar systems underutilized. Worse yet, the best parameter combination changes as resource availability evolves in these heterogeneous environments, making it difficult for users to respond to the dynamism in real-time. Machine-learning-based (ML) performance modeling and tuning can automate this decision-making process. However, off-the-shelf ML techniques assume that parameters are independent, thus failing to exploit their correlations during performance prediction. Consequently, the current approaches need to retrain models as the environment changes, requiring substantial training data and a long time to adjust their predictions. This project will overcome the gaps mentioned above by transforming performance data into a graph structure to capture the parameter relationships and leveraging the recent advancements in graph-based learning methods to accelerate real-time decision-making in HPC. Specifically, this project will build generalizable and interpretable ML techniques for recommending parameter settings to users, software, and facilities so that simulations can finish faster by efficiently utilizing the computing resources. The resulting engine, InteLytics, will fill gaps identified by ASCR experts toward an automated workflow management system in heterogeneous computing environments."

Our group models low-energy hadron linacs and storage rings by using electron beams at reduced energies. To support this research, we developed the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER), which operates over a range of parameters; from those typical in existing high-energy machines to well beyond levels presently being reached. The proposed research topic has three main parts: 1. Novel accelerator focusing schemes: Accelerators confine and accelerate charged particles for high-energy particle physics research. The accelerated particles are like-charged and tend to repel each other, making confining them difficult. However, confinement is achieved by passing the particles through an array of magnets (a lattice) designed to counteract the particles&rsquo; natural repulsion. We are investigating a novel scheme for the magnetic field lattice that has the potential to confine higher intensity beams than have been confined in the past. Specifically, we plan to continue the line of experiments conducted during the last year on a nonlinear, quasi-integrable lattice containing a single channel of octupoles and explore alternative configurations if the research so indicates. 2. New methods for lattice design: We will develop a new theory and methodology for design of magnetic field lattices, which incorporates the effect of particle-particle repulsion from the beginning, using so-called adjoint techniques to optimize lattice parameters. This approach, to be integrated with our simulation codes, introduces a quick method to assess and optimize the impact on specific figures of merit of changes in lattice parameters such as magnet strength and position. The adjoint approach allows for the determination of the dependence of any figure of merit with respect to all lattice parameters in a few computations and is dramatically faster than direct calculation by individual variation of each parameter. 3. Measurement and simulation of space-charge dependent issues in longitudinal beam stability and dynamics: The beam in UMER is injected as a short pulse that then travels around an 11m circular path many times. Without what is called longitudinal confinement, the bunch will spread out around the circular path with fast electrons running ahead and slow electrons falling behind. Eventually the fast electrons &ldquo;lap&rdquo; the slow ones. Once this happens instability is observed. That is, the fast and slow electrons interact creating unwanted clumps of charge. We have published studies of a classical two-stream instability related in principle to the so-called cloud instability seen in ion synchrotrons and storage rings (e.g. the LHC). A second instability, the focus of the proposed research, is excited by the coupling of the transverse oscillations of the central portions of the beam with the leading and trailing edges of the beam as they overlap the main body. The spreading of the beam that leads to overlap can be arrested by longitudinal confinement. This consists of systematically slowing the leading electrons and speeding up the trailing electrons. With longitudinal confinement using a pulsed induction cell, very rapid bunch compression and resonance crossing can be achieved in a rapid, controlled way. The goal here is a strategy that significantly increases stable bunch peak current. Longitudinal bunch confinement over many turns, via either induction or RF means is needed to study instabilities whose growth times cover many revolutions of the beam."

However, the disparate time scales of photodriven charge separation (~fs) and steps in chemical reactions (~µs) represent an inherent bottleneck in solar-to-fuels technology. To solve this problem, copper complexes that undergo light-induced conformational changes are being employed to speed up charge separation, and slow down the reverse process, charge recombination. These dynamics create a charge separated state that lives long enough to facilitate chemical catalysis. This design approach is inspired by nature where conformational control underpins nearly all bioenergy conversion processes. Indeed, bioenergy conversion processes that rely on metalloproteins use triggered conformational changes to reversibly control the timing and direction of electron transfer reactions. The planned research mimics this mechanistic paradigm. Ultimately, this work will establish a new strategy for gating photochemical processes and providing molecular-level control over energetic excited states. These elements of molecular design are adaptable for incorporation into a wide range of assemblies for direct solar energy conversion and storage."

Recent advances in the fields of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have resulted in an unprecedented ability to engineer genomes and design and build gene circuits for improving biofuel production. However, the ability to design and build these genetic variants has far outpaced methods for assessing biofuel production. Current methods for quantifying production rely on low-to-medium throughput approaches such as GC-MS, or indirect measurements such as those using biosensors coupled with fluorescent reporters. A direct, high-throughput method for imaging biofuel production in vivo has the potential to greatly advance our ability to rapidly design, build, and test strains for enhanced biofuel synthesis. This proposal addresses this gap by introducing a technology for directly measuring synthesis of biofuels in living cells. Specifically, we use a chemical imaging method called stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. SRS uses photons to produce a vibrational spectrum on the microsecond time scale. Such high speed allows real-time chemical mapping of a sample at sub-micron diffraction-limited spatial resolution. This capacity is significant for quantifying biofuel synthesis because it can directly reveal production levels and further distinguish between different structures of chemical bonds. In this proposal we focus on fatty acids, which are biodiesel candidates and can serve as precursors to high value oleochemicals. Here, we will develop a high-throughput platform for chemical imaging of biofuel production, which will be used in concert with multiplexed genome engineering and gene circuit design strategies to improve E. coli fatty acid production. Overall, our goal is to introduce SRS imaging as a new technology for directly measuring chemical signatures in in vivo samples for the engineering and optimization of biofuel production strains."

Karr, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK Co-Principal Investigator: Michael J. McInerney, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK Syntrophy is a thermodynamically based metabolic coupling between two or more microorganisms that is essential for the complete mineralization of complex organic material to methane and carbon dioxide in natural environments. Understanding syntrophy is essential to developing efficient biomethanation processes to convert organic wastes and crop residues into the energy-rich fuel, methane. In addition, syntrophic microorganisms are models to understand efficient energy conservation at low thermodynamic driving forces. An important but poorly understood process in syntrophic metabolism is how the electrons generated in the oxidation of acyl-CoA intermediates such as butyryl-CoA or glutaryl-CoA are used to produce hydrogen or formate. We have identified a conduit of protein electron carriers involved in H2 or formate production from the electrons generated in acyl-CoA oxidation in Syntrophomonas wolfei and Syntrophus aciditrophicus. The protein conduit includes acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, electron transfer flavoprotein AB, and a novel membrane-bound oxidoreductase (FeSOR). We hypothesize that FeSOR functions as an Etf:menaquinone oxidoreductase, which oxidizes Etfred and reduces menaquinone in the membrane. Also, we discovered that S. aciditrophicus uses a novel approach to synthesize ATP from acetyl-CoA. Rather than the typical phosphate phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase mechanism used by almost all bacteria, S. aciditrophicus uses an AMP-forming, acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs1) to synthesize ATP from acetyl-CoA, AMP, and pyrophosphate. We will use a variety of biochemical approaches to preliminarily characterize FeSOR and how the structural and energetic features of the Asc1 allow it to function in the ATP-forming direction. The objectives of the proposed work are: (1) to perform preliminary biochemical characterization of FeSOR; and (2) continued functional and structural characterization of the Acs1 from S. aciditrophicus. Full-length, truncations and other variants of FeSOR homologues from S. aciditrophicus and S. wolfei will be overexpressed in Escherichia coli and be characterized for their enzymatic activity and structural properties. We will use homology modeling/docking and X-ray crystallography to determine the position of amino acid side chains in the SaAcs1 active site when ATP is bound. Additionally, X-ray crystallography will be utilized to identify the conformation of SaAcs1 in the presence and absence of ATP and/or acetate. Furthermore, additional amino acid substitutions will be utilized to determine the role of amino acids important for interactions with ATP in the active site of SaAcs1."

This project addresses this shortcoming by developing an optical imager that integrates three imaging modalities in a single device, thus, delineating the following key, yet unknown, parameters: the growth and development of each symbiont, the localization of metabolic pathways, as well as the exchange and fate of key nutrients. By capitalizing on the team’s expertise in bioimaging, plant-fungi biology, optics, biomarkers, and artificial intelligence, this integrative approach will illuminate deep in the root tissue and detect the resulting low signals with adequate spatial and temporal resolution. As such, the proposed imager is expected to provide new fundamental understanding of the interactions between plants and mycorrhizal fungi, which we will also assess during this project. Overall, the proposed investigation contributes to a long-standing DOE goal in energy prosperity, namely: to achieve a predictive understanding of complex biological systems through transformative science and instrumentation solutions."

Knowledge of such genes helps plant breeders to introduce beneficial traits from wild relatives into high-yielding modern crop varieties. Plant biologists can also use that information to understand the role of genetic variation in plant development, evolution, and stress response. However, it is complicated to validate the function of genes at the molecular and physiological levels and determine the importance of the different variants of a gene responsible for a particular trait. Identifying gene function is further complicated when several genes are responsible for a trait of interest. Reducing the number of candidate genes and making an informed decision on which ones should be validated is particularly challenging. This project’s goal is to understand the impact of phosphorus deficiency and cold stress on sorghum lipid metabolism and develop mathematical approaches that will integrate results from different genome-wide association studies and population genetics indexes of selection. With these approaches, metabolic profiling data from a large number of sorghum lines under phosphorus and cold stress will be combined with analyses of geolocated natural populations adapted to those stresses and measures of genetic differentiation. Combining multiple independent datasets will enable the identification and ranking of candidate genes and metabolic pathways involved in these stress responses. The methods developed as part of this project will be applicable to other potential bioenergy crops and different environmental stresses."
Combining Molecular Simulations and Machine Learning to Comprehensively Explore Adsorption Space,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020306,"Medford, Andrew",Andrew.Medford@georgiatechresearchcorporation,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Adsorption of molecules in nanoporous materials forms the basis for a powerful approach to chemical separations. We define the full range of chemical mixtures and adsorbing materials that can be considered for some class of materials as &ldquo;adsorption space&rdquo;. Because the number of distinct molecules that exists is enormous, adsorption space cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally, even for a limited class of adsorbent materials. In this proposal, we describe work that will combine molecular simulations and machine learning to vastly enhance the ability to explore adsorption space for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a diverse class of crystalline nanoporous materials. We will use molecular simulations to directly simulate equilibrium adsorption of ~200 different molecules in each of ~100 distinct MOFs. The selection of both adsorbing molecules and the MOFs in these simulations will be made to generate a diverse range of examples that is suitable for use in machine learning approaches. The results from these molecular simulations will greatly increase the number of adsorbing molecules for which any detailed information is available. Our molecular simulation data will be used in machine learning calculations that seek to define a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; adsorption isotherm for molecules adsorbing in MOFs. Critically, we will develop a two-tiered model that gives a predicted adsorption isotherm for any molecule/adsorbent pair of interest but also an independent prediction of the reliability of the resulting isotherm. We have already performed preliminary calculations that indicate that this approach is feasible. A key innovation in this work will be the development of &ldquo;medium-range&rdquo; descriptors that can capture key physical and chemical information that is not accurately included in existing geometric descriptors of adsorbent structure. In addition to fascinating questions about the kinds of chemical separations that can be achieved using adsorption in MOFs, our results will open paths to addressing key assumptions in existing high throughput screening of adsorption. Specifically, we will use our methods to examine the sensitivity of adsorption to thermal vibrations in the adsorbing material and whether &ldquo;universal&rdquo; force fields for molecule/MOF force fields can be developed with DFT-like accuracy. A powerful result from our work will be the ability to efficiently make predictions about enormous numbers of mixture isotherms. We will exploit our machine learning approaches to generate a diverse test set of binary adsorption data that will be directly examined using molecular simulations. This test set will allow us to thoroughly consider key sources of uncertainty in making precise predictions of selectivity in adsorbed mixtures in crystalline nanoporous materials."

In these conditions, X-ray intensity will become too severe for the existing materials. Diamond is the most promising, if not only candidate, due to its high thermal conductivity, small thermal expansion, and low X-ray absorption. Unfortunately, the availability of large size, high-crystallinity, and low-defect density diamond substrates is very limited. Presently, there are no suppliers of high-quality diamonds with low defect concentrations in the United States to support this rapidly developing field of diamond X-ray optics applications for the next generation sources. We will develop the modified High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) temperature gradient growth technology that will allow growing the highest crystalline quality large diamond crystals, with dislocation density less than 10 cm-2. Among two synthetic diamond lab-grown technologies, the HPHT approach is superior over CVD for X-ray applications due to its near-equilibrium growth nature that allows for large crystals with almost three orders of magnitude fewer defect densities than CVD-grown plates. The main prerequisite for the near dislocation-free HPHT diamond growth is a reduction of nitrogen impurities to less than 1 ppm-level. Unique total environmental control of all processing steps will be utilized to achieve required diamond crystal purity and structure perfection. In Phase I, an extensive process of modeling and optimization of TGG HPHT reactor geometry and growth parameters was conducted. We modeled temperature field distribution inside the HP chamber at different stages of diamond crystal growth. We identify conditions of cell geometry and ambient parameters necessary for increasing the crystal size. Despite COVID-19 obstacles, we were able to conduct two testing runs of HPHT crystal growth, optimized for reduced nitrogen contamination. In tight collaboration with the APS ANL team, the materials were characterized using several X-ray techniques. In addition, we performed optical cross-polarizer analysis, UV-light, and micro- Raman characterization of selected samples. We achieved very encouraging results: the grown crystals had already surpassed the sizes specified in the topic. The largest diamond plate cut from these crystals has dimensions 6.5x6.5x0.5 mm3. White-beam x-ray topography demonstrated near dislocation free quality, and analysis of spatial variations in the Bragg angle from the ideal direction was within 300 nrad/mm2 for the best sample. In Phase II, we will address the remaining HP cell design and technological questions and build a custom HPHT diamond reactor system. Multiple optimization trials will be performed to identify the best growth conditions for large size high-quality diamonds. X-ray and other characterizations will be conducted and analyzed after each test. At the end of Phase II, we will be well prepared to scale up and commercialize high-quality diamond substrates for scientific applications. This project's long-term goal is to establish the first USA-based HPHT diamond growth facility capable of producing the highest quality large SC diamonds matching X-ray optics requirements. The technology developed here is required to utilize X-ray beams at fourth generation light sources to maximum potential. High-quality diamond is virtually the only material that can withstand the next- generation light sources' heat load. If a manufacturing technology for large size HPHT diamond substrate is established, diamond-based optical elements will supersede the current silicon and beryllium alternatives, which have lower performance and severe health and safety concerns. High-quality diamond material will also benefit quantum computing, industrial, medical, and other industrial applications."

Approaching these finite systems from the molecular side are large polycyclic molecules. Among the primary phenomena being studied are processes of energy transformation, ultrafast electron excitation, light scattering and generation, an all-optical Hall Effect, and the all-optical control of such phenomena. Infinite 2d crystals are currently relatively well studied and understood, but little is known about their finite counterparts: nanopatches and large polycyclic molecules. Importantly, the development of the modern electronics deals with the sizes on the nanometer scale. Therefore this project has not only a fundamental importance, but also an applied significance. This project includes the following major thrusts: 1. Investigating finite 2d graphene and TMDC patches and large molecules with the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to find electron distributions as the Wigner density matrix. 2. Developing the density matrix techniques to incorporate ultrafast electron relaxation needed for the description of high harmonic generation. 3.

At some scale of complexity, molecules gain the ability to control this process and direct the energy to accomplish useful tasks. This project seeks an answer to the question of where this scale begins, and specifically whether very energetic excitations in relatively simple molecules can be controlled. Lasers are our best tool to controllably add energy into molecules, and this project investigates the excitations and the subsequent dynamics produced by recently developed laser pulses with durations on the femtosecond (10-15 seconds) and attosecond (10-18 seconds) timescales. These pulses approach the natural timescale of the motion of electrons in molecules and can excite localized motion of electrons or atoms in molecules. The question of whether chemical reactions can be controlled with lasers has been explored in detail, especially for the ground state and the first few electronic excited states of molecules. While these initial questions were met with some successes and many struggles, recent progress in the field has seen the laser-induced formation of chemical bonds and the control of fragmentation in strong fields. These successes, and the ability to use attosecond pulses to prepare molecules in excited states higher in the energy spectrum, renew the promise of exerting specific control over molecules and their transformations. High-lying excited states in molecules, which are relatively unexplored, have different coupling regimes, transition timescales, and state densities compared to the ground state and first few excited states. The unique properties of high-lying excited states provide new targets that can be used to control the flow of energy in excited molecules. Importantly, the theoretical tools to describe the energetic excitations and their control are also at the forefront of method development. This project takes advantage of recent advances in the areas of quantum optimal control theory, electronic structure including ionizing states, and nuclear dynamics in order to describe excitations with attosecond pulses and develop the control schemes that can exploit them. The methods developed in this project push forward the abilities to compute dynamics in these systems and to provide unprecedented control of molecules.

Currently available systems are an order of magnitude too slow, require severely limited beam intensity, and present huge challenges with the massive amounts of data they deliver to the user’s computer. Addressing these issues requires a new strategy for data collection and processing. Building on our successful Phase I work, we propose to continue the development and commercialization of a new edge-computing electron counting camera that takes advantage of a novel sparse, binary-readout direct electron sensor that we have successfully developed and fabricated. Instead of the conventional brute- force imaging approach to electron counting used by existing cameras, our strategy is to record detection events on the sensor and then perform electron counting operations in hardware located in the camera head, thereby relieving associated computer resources for processing such high-speed data. In Phase I, we successfully operated a prototype camera, demonstrating the low-noise, high-sensitivity, and high-dynamic-range performance of our new sensor and proving our edge-computing strategy for electron counting. In Phase II, we will improve performance by refining our edge-computing electron counting algorithm to improve performance, further boost framerate by applying lossless compression in hardware/firmware, integrate the new camera in user-focused data acquisition software, and synchronize data acquisition with data from state-of-the-art third-party in situ specimen holders. The resulting commercialized system will provide a 16-megapixel camera system, delivering continuous real- time streaming with significantly higher dynamic range, less noise, and higher frame rate than any currently- available TEM camera. This will be a tremendous benefit for multi-dimensional electron microscopy in private, public, and national laboratories working in a wide variety of fields. Microscopists will be able to take advantage of recent and upcoming advances in TEM instrumentation by capturing high-speed specimen dynamics, and doing so without the exposure rate constraints imposed by conventional electron counting cameras. Removing the camera as a limiting factor for TEM imaging will make it indispensable for a wide variety of TEM techniques, including high-speed continuous tilt tomography, in situ microscopy, and cryo-EM of both materials and biological specimens. liquid helium temperature."

Zhang, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (Co-Investigator) Sequence-homology and experimental approaches have enabled functional annotation of many plant and algal genes, but around half of the predicted proteins in most sequenced green-lineage genomes remain as unknowns, with no information on structure or function. While some of these unknown proteins are lineage-specific or even species-specific, a sizable number are conserved within the Viridiplantae (green algae + land plants) or within large sub-groups of plants (e.g. monocots, dicots). These unknown conserved proteins are likely to play important roles in core plant biological processes. Through this project, we will establish a pipeline and associated databases for structural prediction and functional characterization of plant proteins of unknown function (Deep Green proteins), including around 500 unknown proteins from the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and/or the model C4 bioenergy monocot Setaria viridis (Setaria) with homologs in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Chlamydomonas), where we can perform high throughput functional genomics screening. This project leverages expertise in structural genomics and high-performance bioinformatics computing from team members at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), omics-based computational predictions from team members at University of Missouri (MU), and algal and plant functional genomics expertise from team members at Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. The Deep Green project is divided into five major objectives to characterize and annotate unknown plant proteins, which include 1) Assembly and ongoing curation of the Deep Green candidate protein set; 2) in silico structural predictions and network analyses to assign structures and predict function; 3) Assembly and curation of reverse genetic resources in Chlamydomonas; 4) functional genomics characterization and prioritization in Chlamydomonas; and 5) structural validation of selected candidates and functional validation in two important reference plants, Arabidopsis and Setaria. The rich new data resources produced under the Deep Green project will be curated in one or more public databases, including DOE-supported KBase. These data will help guide researchers in investigating the contribution of conserved unknown proteins to diverse aspects of photosynthetic biology that impact photosynthesis, biomass accumulation, and stress responses.

From viruses to protists: temperature response of the neglected components of microbial controls on peatland nutrient cycling,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020362,"Gibert, Jean",Jean.Gibert@dukeuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Peatlands are one of the most highly threatened ecosystems on earth. They occupy only 3% of the Earth&rsquo;s land surface but store approximately 25% of terrestrial carbon (C) as organic matter. The moss genus Sphagnum is responsible for much of the primary production in these harsh habitats, which are naturally low in mineral nitrogen (N) availability. As such, Sphagnum success and productivity depends on symbiotic interactions with microbial organisms: approximately 35% of the N used by Sphagnum is supplied by N2-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs). N availability is a crucial determinant of Sphagnum growth, and thus, C sequestration in peatlands, which in turn impacts global biogeochemistry and climate. Our preliminary data collected at the DOE SPRUCE site suggest that field warming drastically alters the Sphagnum-associated microbiome with decreased diazotroph abundance and reduced N2-fixation. Yet, the mechanisms driving these changes in community composition and N2-fixation remain unknown. Preliminary data suggest that viruses and unicellular eukaryotes (protists) are present and active in Sphagnum communities and may shape microbial community composition and biogeochemistry. Viruses are the most abundant bioactive agents on Earth, driving host evolution through infections and horizontal gene transfer. Similarly, protists are largely ignored in microbiome studies, but are the most important consumers of prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea). Viral and protist responses to warming, as well as their impact on structuring the Sphagnum microbiome are, however, not known. The primary objective of this proposal is to provide a mechanistic understanding of how protist grazing and viral activity mediate Sphagnum responses to warming and to develop a model of Sphagnum-associated community response to predict changes in C and N biogeochemical cycles across sites and species of peatland mosses. To carry out these objectives, we will use a combination of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, paired with microcosm experiments and modeling. Briefly, Part 1 addresses the impacts of warming on Sphagnum communities at SPRUCE. Part 2 investigates the mechanisms underlying these community changes in a series of laboratory experiments involving S. fallax, bacteria, viruses, and protists. Part 3 uses our lab-based mechanistic insights to parameterize a food-web-virus model designed to better understand and predict warming impacts on community composition, the dynamics of Sphagnum-associated communities, and C sequestration in peatlands. This model will be integrated with current ELM-SPRUCE modeling efforts. Part 4 expands our sampling to include additional Sphagnum species, microhabitats (hummock vs hollow), and peatlands in different climatic regions to test community structure and ecosystem function model predictions. Results of this research will dramatically impact the way we study the effects of warming, as the mechanisms uncovered via the proposed experiments are likely to apply to other systems where protists and viruses are prevalent. We also hope to provide a necessary framework that links metagenomics and metatranscriptomics &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; data to the underlying mechanisms of change."

The brain forms a cognitive map that allows navigating in such environments – however, most of what we know about the brain’s cognitive map stems from experiments done on animals navigating in simple, small, and stable environments. Here we propose to study the hippocampus – a brain region that is crucial for spatial memory – in freely flying bats navigating in very large environments, including under demanding scenarios of collision-avoidance with other individuals during flight. Through close collaboration between theoretical and experimental neuroscientists we will address fundamental open questions on the neurobiology of navigation: First, we will test the hypothesis that the representation of large-scale environments in the hippocampus is optimal. To do this, we will generalize Claude Shannon’s classical 1940's information theory, to apply to a scenario of spatial coding – taking into account the magnitude of the animals’ localization errors (in other words, ""how far is my perceived location from my true location?""), as well as the fact that animals move during navigation, which introduces correlations between nearby locations which did not exist in Shannon's formulation of the problem. This work will allow us to disentangle how environmental factors and behavioral factors affect spatial representations in the brain. We will compare the theoretical results to wireless neural recordings from bats flying in a 200-meter long tunnel. Second, we will ask what is the cellular mechanism allowing the emergence of the neuronal spatial representation we found in the hippocampus. More specifically, we will ask how mechanisms of changes of synaptic connections between neurons (""synaptic plasticity"") support modification of the circuit as the animal learns, and as it becomes more familiar with the environment. To do this we will utilize a new and surprising plasticity rule that we recently discovered. To test our theoretical predictions, we propose to conduct simultaneous electrophysiological recordings in the input and output neurons of the hippocampus. This will allow us to test how changes in synaptic connections affect spatial representations, as animals navigate in large environments. These data will allow us to build a first-of-its-kind comprehensive mechanistic model of spatial learning in the hippocampus. Third, we will ask how the representation of an animal’s own location is affected by the presence of a conspecific, or inanimate objects (flying drones). We will analyze hippocampal representations during 'solo' navigation in the long tunnel vs. flights that include interactions with another bat. This will serve as a case study for combining our two approaches described above: We will ask if neuronal representations found under this new demanding condition are optimal (top-down functional approach), and will investigate what is the synaptic plasticity rule that may support them (bottom-up mechanistic approach). Experimentally we will also test the effect of the other bat’s identity and sex on spatial representations. In summary: Our project will shed novel light on the relation between biological mechanisms and optimal performance of neural codes in a key region of the mammalian brain."

Unfortunately, the development and testing of such application software now faces many serious productivity crises brought about by the increased use of heterogeneity. In practical terms, extreme heterogeneity implies the use of CPUs, GPUs and accelerators from different manufacturers, alternatives to traditional IEEE number representations, and compilers and numerical libraries that employ new instruction sets and computational units such as Tensor Cores. These changes have both fundamental and pervasive impact throughout the software stack. They affect the behavior of a number of aspects of today’s HPC software, throwing today’s software testing methods for HPC completely off-track. This proposal is on new testing methods that not only help restore order but stay relevant despite the continued growth of heterogeneity. The specific focus of our work is on numerical correctness. In their quest to reduce data movement costs, designers of modern HPC systems have embraced different lower precision arithmetic schemes that are supported by a plethora of computing substrates and compilers. Amidst these flurry of changes, even a simple step such as a compiler upgrade can cause significant ripple effects in terms of numerical result aberrations. Often, expert human intervention is needed to repair the situation. Work in the ComPort project will approach these challenges under four thrusts. The first, Testing for Reusable and Composable Software Development, will develop component interface characterization methods that lead to testing efficiency. Work under this thrust will not only enhance the coverage of all important facets of a components’ behavior but also avoid wasting testing cycles by repeatedly covering scenarios previously seen. Testing for Portability and Automation-assistance is the second thrust of ComPort. Upon encountering numerical errors, a number of correction strategies must be manually employed: changing the compiler optimization flags; using extra precision (deduced through manual reasoning) for selected variables; and even selective rewrite of code to real-number equivalent alternate forms that help lower the rounding error. This thrust will explore methods to automatically carry out such repairs. It will also develop methods to ensure numerical correctness portability when performance portability frameworks such as Kokkos and RAJA are employed. Testing/Monitoring for Inputs and Runtime Behavior is the third thrust of ComPort. Software components have long lives, and hence must be adjusted over time to operate under different circumstances. Not only have the parallel programming models become richer, the components may be subject to new input ranges, and may be run on hardware whose specifications also evolve over time. Testing methods must stay nimble to these changes. Our work will employ various runtime monitoring methods both to detect the onset of problems, and to glean facts (e.g., value intervals seen) that can be recorded in a components’ interface to help minimize test coverage duplication. Test Feedback and User Actionability is the fourth and final thrust of ComPort. Test management is a complex problem given the sheer number of parameters (problem sizes, machine parameters, problem parameters, runtime flag options, minibatch sizes, etc.) that fly about. We will automate the mining of relationships between these system parameters. When failures occur, we will provide higher-level feedback as well as enable high-level actionability. The research of this project will be carried out over three years through collaboration between universities and DOE labs. Its development will be driven by various Exascale Computing Proxy-Applications. At the end of three years, the ComPort testing framework will be demonstrated on two non-trivial actual applications. Publications and student/postdoc training will be additional outcomes in addition to the release of versions of ComPort after each of the three years."

This collaborative proposal aims to develop techniques for the production of important medical “isotope pairs” of scandium: 43Sc, 44Sc, and 47Sc. By leveraging complementary infrastructure available at the three collaborating instructions, we aim to set up a robust supply of these isotopes and develop broadly applicable techniques for their production using a variety of accelerator technology and radiochemical techniques. We aim to investigate production routes to these important radioisotopes of scandium via a multipronged approach: (1) We propose the student and postdoc-driven production of 43,44Sc and 47Sc from Ca targets at the University of Wisconsin. (2) We propose the student and postdoc-driven production of 43,44Sc and 47Sc from Ti targets using the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s unique capabilities for proton irradiations.

Students and postdoctoral trainees will interact with mentors at UWisc, UAB, and Argonne on a daily basis, having regular opportunities to interact with the other members of the collaboration in a collegial, supportive environment that facilitates their professional growth and offers diverse experience in the fields of accelerator targetry and radiochemistry, spectroscopy, radiation spectrometry and nuclear data measurements. The project is expected to catalyze use of radioisotopes of scandium for research which will probe the utility of new agents for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Scandium radioisotopes are of intense current importance to peptide-based ligands used in cutting edge techniques for cancer imaging and treatment and have recently been proposed as a valuable improvement to state-of-the-art imaging agents that use other radionuclides. Removing production obstacles currently limiting their availability is an objective eagerly sought by cancer and molecular imaging physicians at many institutions, and is expected to impact the standard of care for diseases susceptible to targeting with scandium-labeled pharmaceuticals."
A New Approach to Achieving High Granularity in Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0020572,"Islam, Mohammed",Mohammed.Islam@cactusmaterials,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","A New Approach to Achieving High Granularity in Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors—Cactus Materials, 7700 South River Parkway, Tempe, AZ 85284 Mohammed Islam, Principal Investigator, rafiqul.islam@cactusmaterials.com Mohammed Islam, Business Official, rafiqul.islam@cactusmaterials.com Amount: $1,149,993.00 The development of Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) over the past five years has opened up the possibility of ultra-precise timing measurements (better than ±30 psec) and high-frame rate sensing and imaging (in excess of 500 MHz) for X-rays and high-energy charged particles. However, due to the need to avoid electrical breakdown between neighboring pixel, conventional LGADs include inter-pixel isolation structures that limit the granularity to the 1x1 mm2 scale. Here, we propose the continue development of the Deep Junction LGAD (DJ- LGAD), a novel approach that will allow segmentation at the 10x10 µm2 scale while maintaining the precise timing resolution characteristic of LGADs. In the DJ-LGAD approach, a highly- doped junction is formed several microns below the surface of the sensor, isolating the high-field gain region from the surface electrode structure, and thus avoiding electrical breakdown between electrodes without the inclusion of inter-pixel termination structures. Two fabrication techniques to form the deep junction will be explored at the lead company (Cactus Materials): wafer-to- wafer bonding and epitaxial growth. During Phase-I work, a program of TCAD simulation was undertaken that allowed the conceptual DJ-LGAD idea to be developed into a fabricable planar (non-segmented) device with a stable buried junction. Fabrication parameters, including implantation dose and incidence angle, junction termination geometry (including guard-ring structure), annealing parameters, and junction width and depth, were established by the simulation studies. Preliminary fabrication results suggest that both wafer bonding and epitaxy are viable approach to fabricate the devices. Wafer bonding technique would be a transformational technology as it can enable detectors with dissimilar materials (III-V) along with silicon materials. I-V measurement from Phase I results suggest interface between wafers are electrically conductive. Further study is in progress to fabricate a fully planar DJ-LGAD device by the end of Phase I. The Phase-II project will build on this, refining the wafer-to-wafer bonding approach and developing the epitaxial method. TCAD simulation studies will be used to extend the planar design of the Phase-I prototype to a fully granular design, which will then be fabricated and characterized with X-ray and proton beams. Commercialization strategies will also be developed. Applications within the realm of pure science include 4D and next-generation silicon strip tracking for further exploration of the fundamental building blocks of the universe and the structure and behavior of nuclear matter. Applications within the realm of applied science and technology include medical tomography and imaging, optoelectronic communication, photon and materials science (X-ray imaging and diffraction) and accelerator development."
Effects of hurricane disturbance and increased temperature on carbon cycling and storage of a Puerto Rican forest: a mechanistic investigation of above- and belowground processes,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,89243018SSC000017,"Reed, Sasha",Sasha.Reed@usgeologicalsurvey,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Effects of hurricane disturbance and increased temperature on carbon cycling and storage of a Puerto Rican forest: a mechanistic investigation of above- and belowground processes Tana E.

Reed, US Geological Survey (Co-Investigator) Jennifer Pett-Ridge, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) Karis McFarlane, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) Xaiojuan Yang, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Senior Personnel) Hurricanes affect nearly every continent in the world and are among the most intense weather disturbances in forest ecosystems. In 2017, the coastal United States (US) and Puerto Rico were devastated by a series of major hurricanes that caused more than $200 billion in damages, which will have long-lasting implications for the economics and natural resources of US forests. At the same time, models project that temperatures in the tropics and subtropics will increase by 3-5 oC within the next 20 years. The combined effects of hurricane disturbance and warmer temperatures could fundamentally alter the trajectory and duration of forest recovery following disturbance, resulting in altered ecosystem states that are difficult to predict from historical data alone. Despite the immediate and significant effects of hurricanes on forest carbon and nutrients, as well as the potential to affect the long-term trajectory of forest recovery, hurricanes are not currently represented in Earth System Models, and no studies have captured the potential interactions of hurricanes within the context of a changing climate. To address this major knowledge gap, we will take advantage of a once-in-a-century opportunity to investigate the recovery of forest structure and function following a major hurricane disturbance under experimentally warmed conditions. We will leverage an already established field warming experiment in Puerto Rico (Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment [TRACE]), funded by the USDA Forest Service and the US Department of Energy, to capitalize on the experiment&rsquo;s wealth of pre-hurricane baseline data, including microclimate data before and during Hurricanes Irma and Maria, as well as multiple aspects of forest response following these major storms. TRACE is uniquely positioned as the first and only experiment in the world able to evaluate the combined effects of hurricane disturbance and increased temperature in a field setting. We will assess soil carbon, nutrients, and microbial processes along with plant physiology and chemistry in established warming plots impacted by hurricanes in order to address the following research questions: 1. Are there legacy effects of pre-hurricane experimental warming that persist after hurricane disturbance, or does the system &ldquo;re-set&rdquo; itself to new baseline conditions? 2. Will hurricane disturbance and increased temperature interact to generate soil and plant responses that fundamentally alter the trajectory of forest recovery? We will explore these issues both above- and belowground, drawing on a suite of research approaches. With this project, we would collect and synthesize some of the only data in existence that directly inform quantification, evaluation, and modeling of tropical forest responses to the interactive effects of disturbance and warming. Results would directly address DOE&rsquo;s mission to improve our understanding of globally important and environmentally sensitive processes in understudied ecosystems and to improve the quality of complex Earth and environmental model projections."

Compounding this issue in operational technology (OT) systems is: (1) OT systems have unique architectures and use a variety of different, potentially proprietary, protocols, making generalizable solutions difficult to create; and (2) any cybersecurity solution must not interfere with the normal operations of the system. Considering the criticality of OT systems, their cybersecurity must be taken more seriously, with a focus on providing information that results in quicker responses to threats to avoid downtime. This proposal will result in a cyberattack detection and inference solution for OT systems that provides actionable feedback to security personnel, allowing for faster attack classification and response times. The solution will run on its own device, interfacing with OT systems in a way that avoids interfering with normal activity. The solution will also run an anomaly detection framework that provides the evidence of an anomaly to an engine that uses systemic functional grammars (SFGs), a concept from computational linguistics, to represent the attack space. The engine will use the evidence provided by the anomaly detection component to probabilistically determine what attack is currently ongoing, the most likely alternatives, and recommended mitigations, then send this information to security personnel who can take the steps necessary to remediate the attack. Phase I will consist of developing a proof of concept for the solution’s software components. We will work with our subcontractor to identify a target OT system to interface with. We will utilize their subject matter expertise and lab to obtain normal operating data, as well as attack data, from a simulated operational technology system and then leverage this data to put together an end-to-end demonstration of the software components, which include: (1) data ingestion and transformation; (2) ensemble anomaly detection; (3) systemic functional grammar engine; (4) attack evidence to attack class mapping; and (5) recommending mitigations. Phase II will consist of integrating the software component with hardware and integrating the full device with a physical system for testing. We believe the proposed approach has significant commercial benefit, not only because of its cutting- edge anomaly detection component, but because the grammar engine can interface with any anomaly detection capabilities, not just ours. This means the attack mapping engine can be leveraged by other anomaly detection solutions and vice versa. The ability to ground attack classification using probabilistic evidence allows for higher confidence in detected attack vectors, allowing for more concrete mitigation recommendations. These capabilities will lead to better actionable cyber intelligence solutions across the operational technology sector."
Ultra-Sensitive High-Resolution Label-Free Nonlinear Optical Microscopy for Imaging Plant-Microbe Interactions in Vivo,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021986,"Ji, Na",Na.Ji@theregentsofuniversityofcalifornia,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Roots form the foundation for the plants that feed us as well as the biomass that is increasingly being called upon to meet our energy demands. Microbes are an important emerging approach for increasing yield and sustainability in agriculture. Visualizing root morphology at cellular and subcellular resolution is critical for understanding plant growth and the accompanying structural changes, as well as their interactions with microbes in the rhizosphere. Studying the interactions between plants and microbes in the rhizosphere at cellular and subcellular scales requires high-resolution optical imaging methods. Optical microscopy methods utilizing nonlinear optical excitation are capable of optically sectioning opaque samples at subcellular resolution. However, their applications to high-resolution three-dimensional imaging of plants and microbes are limited in imaging depth by scattering and aberration. When applied to chronical imaging of live plants, the high laser power required for nonlinear excitation often leads to deleterious photo-induced effects including sample damages and, for fluorescence imaging, fluorophore bleaching. Coherent nonlinear optical scattering processes such as second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) do not require extrinsic labeling and are resistant to photobleaching. Here we propose to combine several advanced optical techniques with SHG and THG microscopy to address the limitations described above for subcellular live imaging of plant roots and microbes with minimal photodamage. By using homodyne mixing techniques to increase detection sensitivity, we will substantially reduce excitation power and minimize photodamage for chronic in vivo imaging. By using adaptive optics to correct for sample-induced optical aberrations, we will recover diffraction-limited resolution at depth. By using longer wavelength excitation, we will reduce tissue scattering and increase imaging depth. We will test the performance of these ultra-sensitive high-resolution label-free microscopy modalities on live Brachypodium distachyon roots and microbes grown in microfabricated ecosystems (EcoFABs). Our combined efforts of microscopists and plant biologists will provide the first insights into the mechanisms, localization, and sequence of colonization of live plant roots by growth-promoting fungi and bacteria and their effect on root cellular and subcellular morphology and exudates."

Most of these interactions occur in the rhizosphere, defined as the root-soil interface. The field of rhizosphere studies has gained increasing attention because many biological and physicochemical processes at multiple scales are linked to rhizosphere activities. However, while the functional importance of the rhizosphere is recognized, methodological limitations remain a critical challenge. For example, we are still missing the necessary tools to observe the basics and answer questions such as how much carbon is released as exudates (small organic compounds released by roots) and what functions are these exudates being used for. Existing approaches often rely on taking disturbed samples from the root-soil system, which fundamentally deviates from reality. We will advance the field of rhizosphere studies by developing innovative instruments to shift the current imaging approaches from (i) highly artificial environments to natural environments (ii) indirect to direct, (iii) intermittent to continuous, (iv) 2-dimensional (2D) to 3-dimensional (3D), and (v) fragmentary to scalable. Our aims are to combine and integrate our novel radiation detectors, readout electronics, and artificial intelligence-guided signal processing to enable low cost and modular Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) for plant and soil imaging. This project is based on a multi-disciplinary collaboration between researchers from UC Santa Cruz and Stanford University that synergistically combines expertise in detector development and signal processing, molecular imaging system development and integration, CT technology development and CT reconstruction algorithms, and rhizosphere ecology and ecosystem responses to environmental change. The proposed technology will increase the sensitivity of the PET system for dynamic imaging of isotopes with short half-life, required for capturing the plant and soil system. This multimodality imaging system will grow our fundamental capability to reveal the puzzling complexity and crucial Earth system functions of the rhizosphere. We will demonstrate some of the capabilities of the new system by directly observing root exudate dynamics and rhizosphere hotspots (small spots of the soil volume with extremely high biological activities) in order to address three challenging questions: (1) Is there a 3D coordination between a shifting constellation of rhizosphere hotspots and the soil physicochemical matrix? (2) Are there substantial amounts of root exudates being microbially used in the rhizosphere but mistakenly treated as root respiration? (3) How much of the root exudates get stabilized by clay adsorption in the rhizosphere? Answers to these questions may have important implications for other disciplines in Earth system science, for enhancing carbon sequestration to fight against global climate change, and for promoting production of green energy and soil health."

Sevov, Assistant Professor Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry The Ohio State University Columbus, OH 43210 This research program will develop new reaction technologies that enable selective modification of chlorinated plastics to create materials with altered physical properties, improved lifetimes, and new end-of-life applications. Post-synthetic functionalization of polymers is critically important for modifying the physical properties of plastics that are prepared with limited control over the molecular structure. Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is an example of such a polymer, which has narrow range of macromolecular properties. Altering these properties such that PVC can be utilized in a wide range of applications requires high loadings (up to 50%) of plasticizers, toxic stabilizers, and volatile impact modifiers. These formulations limit PVC recyclability, safety, and long-term stability. As examples, PVCs containing different plasticizers cannot be recycled together. Over time, the non-covalent additives leach from PVC. Leached plasticizers present an environmental hazard and leave the resulting plastic brittle with an increased susceptibility to forming microplastics. Finally, disposal of chlorinated polymers is energy intensive because conventional approaches of polyolefin pyrolysis create corrosive and acutely-toxic products. The program objective is to develop solutions to these challenges through the discovery and mechanistic understanding of new reaction chemistries using electrocatalysis for C–Cl bond functionalization that can be applied directly on polymer chains. Through this research, the performance of PVCs will for the first time be controlled at the molecular level, rather than through formulations chemistries that rely on non-covalent additives."
Collaborative Research: Understanding the role of polymer topology on molecular deformation and scission under extreme shear using in situ neutron scattering,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020988,"Helgeson, Matthew","Matthew.Helgeson@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,santabarbara","['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Flow processes for engineered polymers in energy production, efficiency, and recycling/upcycling can experience extreme deformation rates that can break chemical bonds along the polymer backbone, leading to mechanical degradation and compromised performance. Modern approaches to engineer this behavior involve the design of topologically complex polymers including branched and star-like architectures. However, previously established relationships between topology and extreme shear rheology of polymers have remained largely empirical due to a lack of methods to characterize fluid and molecular microstructure in extreme flows. The proposed research aims to fill this gap by developing mechanistic, molecular-scale understanding for how topology affects polymer deformation at very high shear rates, and how this deformation drives the breakage of chemical bonds along the polymer. This will be achieved through in situ small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements and parameter-matched molecular simulations and scattering models that can resolve single-molecule deformations of polymers at extreme shear rates, which will be applied to families of topologically complex polymers where synthetic control will be used to understand how the type and degree of branching on a polymer influence the distribution of molecular deformation and tension at extreme shear rates. Results will be combined with theories for the chemical kinetics of chemical bond scission under tension to generate an in silico model to predict the mechanical degradation of polymers observed in ex situ experiments. Ultimately, these studies will provide guidelines for engineering polymers to enhance mechanical stability, or conversely to engineer flows that direct the mechanical degradation of polymers for targeted materials properties and applications. This project critically leverages a recently developed in situ neutron scattering technique for SANS in high shear rate flows, called capillary rheo-SANS, which will be disseminated to the national neutron scattering community through established collaborations with beam scientists at neutron sources."

We will pursue this by focusing on a novel class of “patchy” metallic nanoparticles (NPs). These particles exhibit spatially discrete surface domains, akin to proteins. The surface heterogeneity can lead to directional interactions and a force imbalance that allows engineering of equilibrium self-assembly, out-of-equilibrium motility, and collective behaviors on length scales that so far have seen limited realization and characterization. We will integrate advances in synthesis of patchy NPs, liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, and algorithms for many-body interactions into a framework for electrokinetic modeling and customized motion analysis. Our primary goals are to understand the working mechanisms of patchy “machines” on the nanoscale and organize them into patterns that vary over space and time. These so-called active materials can change their form and function as needed. Our inspiration comes from the observation that cyclic patterns underly most systems in nature that perform useful work, yet their realization in man-made materials that are reconfigurable on the nanoscale is extremely limited. The ability to undergo cooperative transitions in morphology will provide new opportunities for controlling processes such as mass and energy transport—in contrast, most synthetic materials exhibit only a single form and perform limited functions throughout their performance lifespan. The experimental–simulation collaboration also appeals to the mission of broader scientific endeavors, such as the Materials Genome Initiative, bringing this approach to a regime which has historically been a challenge for soft materials."

While storage remains the key for all of these applications, no single battery type is capable of filling all the widely varying requirements. We need a range of &ldquo;designer&rdquo; batteries, each tailored to the requirements of its host application. At the same time, each of these designer batteries must perform multiple, often competing, tasks such as frequent cycling and long-life, high-energy density and slow self-discharge, or fast-charging and no safety risk. JCESR&rsquo;s Renewal Proposal addresses these two pervasive energy storage challenges &ndash; designer batteries tailored to applications, and batteries achieving apparently competing performance metrics. The renewal introduces a new vision for creating battery materials, deliberately constructing them from the bottom up, atom-by-atom and molecule-bymolecule, where each atom or molecule plays a prescribed role in producing targeted material behavior. Achieving this bottom-up vision requires solving three science challenges that underlie electrical storage: how ionic charges configure and move in liquids, solids, and interfaces; how new classes of chains of charge-storing molecules can be manipulated for higher performance and responsive behavior; and how defects, disorder and heterogeneity control energy storage phenomena at the atomic level. Solving these three challenges are the scientific goals of JCESR. These scientific goals capture the frontier challenges in electrochemistry and battery science at the atomic and molecular level. The JCESR Renewal Proposal is organized into 5 scientific Thrusts (see Section 6.0 Narrative) that unpack these goals and take concrete steps to achieve them. These Thrusts create a new bottom up approach to electrochemistry and battery science that designs and constructs materials at the atomic and molecular level to produce targeted behavior at the macroscopic level. It enables, for example, designing new atomic and molecular structures that simultaneously meet multiple performance requirements that are often anti-correlated. The impact of such a disruptive approach to battery materials science will be to pave the way for a future wherein energy storage will be designed for specific applications, rather than shoehorning a few existing battery types into many disparate applications."

At the same time, the scientific goals of the project aim to advance current research in uncertainty quantification of nuclear interactions, sensitivity analysis in shell model calculations, and proton-induced fission yields. Nuclear science is a mature field with many important applications, not only to nuclear power generation and national security, but also in astrophysics and tests of fundamental symmetries. Yet it is not enough for theorists to compute a result; we need to know how uncertain those results are. Interpreting even null results as upper limits means we need to understand the error bars in the theory. Meaningful comparisons between theory and experiment are only possible when both approaches provide properly quantified uncertainties. By providing research and career development opportunities, financial support, and direct mentoring to undergraduate students from a Minority Serving Institution we aim to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups that continue into graduate school and a potential career in nuclear physics. In particular, the proposed program will support three undergraduate students and pair each of them with one of the investigators to work on a specific research project. The research projects in this program include: Quantify the uncertainty of a first-principles nuclear interaction due to the uncertainty in nucleon-nucleon scattering data using statistical resampling techniques. Explore the sensitivity of low-energy states in nuclear structure calculations through well-known techniques such as least squares optimization and principal component analysis.

If a room temperature superconductor were found, it would enable a wide variety of transformative technological applications ranging from power transmission and protection of the national electricity grid to high-speed rail, vastly improved magnets for medical imaging, and next-generation computer architectures. Thus far, superconductors have been discovered mostly by trial-and-error. However, the huge number of possible materials (given ~100 elements in the periodic table) means that a novel data science approach can make an essential contribution to this search. This project supports a paradigm shift in the discovery of novel superconductors by exploiting critical recent developments that combine increases in computing power, novel machine-learning algorithms, searchable databases of both computed and experimental properties, and improved experimental capabilities. These will enable the screening of computational materials databases for promising candidates, the rapid prediction of structures and properties of novel materials in an automated, high-throughput fashion, and the efficient experimental testing of these predictions. The overarching goals of the proposed work are to (1) develop, validate, and disseminate tools that allow high-throughput prediction of new phonon-mediated superconductors, and to (2) employ these tools in a concerted effort to discover new superconductors based on the electron-phonon interaction, for which the fundamental underlying theory is understood. This project is devoted to the design and discovery of new high-temperatures superconductors. Materials will be studied using modern density functional theory codes to predict parameters important for superconductivity. The vast space of known and predicted complex materials will be winnowed by use of a set of filters based on these calculations. Then, Tc will be calculated using Eliashberg theory or a simplified variant thereof. This process will be accelerated using a recently developed technique called equation-based machine learning, applied by the team to make rough estimates of Tc. The predictive models will be expressed as learned analytical formulae relating physics-based predictors and combinations thereof with algebraic operations such as addition and exponentiation. If Tc and other calculated properties seem promising, the materials will be grown as crystals in the laboratory, and their Tc and other sample properties measured. They will then be studied for their behavior under pressure, and crystal structures and electronic energy bands will be analyzed in order to better understand the reasons for the high critical temperature. For many years it was thought that there was an upper limit on the Tc that could be achieved with the electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity, but the recent world record Tc materials, hydrogen sulfide and lanthanum hydride, have shown that this is not the case. The discovery of even a single useful superconducting material, either with very high Tc or even with lower Tc but possibly with high critical field, good wire-forming ability, and low cost, could have a significant impact on technology. Finally, the work will undoubtedly contribute insights into the optimal conditions that give rise to the fascinating and fundamental quantum mechanical phenomenon of superconductivity."

Computational science and engineering (CSE) is a multidisciplinary approach that leverages scientific computing to develop practical problem-solving methods and to supply technical tools across the scientific discovery spectrum. The Program has a particular emphasis on HPC-enabled CSE that advances science and engineering in directions important to the US Department of Energy and to the US economy in general. Over the past half-century, HPC has been an essential tool for DOE’s success. Indeed, during this period, important missions, such as nuclear stockpile stewardship, have turned to HPC as an essential technology. Entire science disciplines, such as biology and cosmology, have been transformed through the augmentation of scientific observation via HPC. At government laboratories and in industry, fellowship alumni are helping push traditional HPC boundaries while contributing to discoveries in additive manufacturing, nanomaterials for next-generation batteries and transistors, and turbine and advanced nuclear reactor design. In addition, HPC is used to address national health needs that will eventually point to cures both by helping cancer researchers manage and analyze huge troves of data and by simulating biological mechanisms and accelerating drug development — including tackling the challenge of COVID-19 through a national HPC consortium anchored by DOE. In academia, faculty alumni are sharing their expertise with students at leading U.S. universities. An explosion in scientific and technological data has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated HPC to transform those data into scientific understanding. With access to more and more data and the proliferation of HPC, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are experiencing a renaissance, complementing the now well-established use of computational simulation. Indeed, in its September 2020 subcommittee report on “AI/ML, Data Intensive Science and High-Performance Computing”, the DOE Advanced Scientific Computing Advisory Committee (ASCAC) explicitly calls out the need for a fellowship program to train computational and data scientists to tackle exascale and data-intensive computing challenges. This collaboration of empirical and theory-based modeling will increasingly inform federal policymakers whose decisions affect American society and future generations. Mirroring this transformative change to computationally enabled science and technology has been a serious need for highly skilled and intellectually agile computational scientists who can support the fast-moving research environment at the DOE National Laboratories and in the national scientific community. In fact, the DOE CSGF program explicitly addresses this need. Financial support is provided through a grant which covers all expenses incurred by Krell Institute and it is anticipated funding from the grant will go directly to the Laboratories for the PIs who reside there."

Liu, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Co-Investigator) Wood formation is the biological process that produces biomass for sustainable bioenergy production. Wood forming cells in trees include fibers, which directly influence the biochemical makeup of wood, and these biochemical characteristics affect the ability to convert wood into bioenergy products. Other wood cell types include water conducting cells, which influence the transport of water and fast growth under permissive conditions, and the ability to withstand water stress during times of drought. Currently, our ability to manipulate wood formation for improved conversion to bioenergy is limited by our understanding of the fundamental processes underlying wood formation. This is because the relevant tissues and cell types lie beneath layers of outer and inner bark, and so are too deep for direct visualization using traditional microscopy methods. To address fundamental biological questions related to differentiation of wood-forming cells, cell wall biosynthesis, metabolic processes, signaling, and transport of materials within and among living cells, novel methods for accessing these cell types are required. Here, we propose to address this accessibility problem by developing and testing two powerful microscopy techniques. These methods will allow direct live-cell imaging of wood-forming cells deep within wood forming tissues. We will develop two different types of implantable imaging probes that will allow direct visualization of wood forming cells. One implantable probe is a cannula (cannula microscopy), a minimally invasive technique whereby an ultra-thin optical probe is inserted into the target tissue; the probe sends excitation light to target cells and retrieves fluorescence signals. The emitted fluorescence will be interpreted using hyperspectral imaging, which in other systems has been demonstrated to provide an unprecedented ability to resolve structures and molecular features at scales ranging from biochemical processes to multi-cellular tissue structures. A machine-learning based image- processing algorithm will convert the spatially scrambled fluorescent signals into images comparable to that of a traditional epifluorescence microscope. The second approach is a miniscope, which is an entirely miniaturized microscope that will be implanted under the tree's bark. This system's strengths are its flexible lens configurations, which will allow optimization for a variety of fields of view and resolutions, and the possibility of providing long-term imaging in remote field locations. Both implantable imaging probes will be fully tested for impact on the vascular cambium and wood differentiation. These microscopy approaches will be tested by applying them to the following problems: (1) analysis of lignification and imaging of lignin precursors; (2) vessel element differentiation, and the impact of abscisic acid levels on vessel cell properties; (3) fiber development in both tension wood and under normal conditions. The development and application of these new microscopy approaches alongside fundamental wood biology analyses will result in optimized resolution, field of view, and through persistent imaging of the same cells, provide novel insights into essential processes of wood formation that influence the resiliency of growth under suboptimal conditions and the cellular features that influence biomass energy conversion properties in poplar trees."

The Stanford/Stanford Linear Accelerator Center multidisciplinary collaboration -- physics, applied physics, and structural biology -- will develop a light-sheet fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope for functional studies of microbial and plant metabolic pathways and dynamic interactions between plants and microorganisms in the rhizosphere. Through combination of the electro-optic fluorescence lifetime imaging method with spectral and polarization-resolved detection, we will enable multi-dimensional information content in wide-field fluorescence images. The proposed approach overcomes the imaging time bottleneck associated with existing fluorescence lifetime imaging methods. Initial demonstrations have shown a factor of 100,000 improvement in photon throughput compared to existing methods. High photon efficiency allowed the first wide-field fluorescence lifetime imaging of single molecules. Recent work has improved the technique’s repetition rate to enable compatibility with mode-locked lasers and demonstrated the combination of wide-field fluorescence lifetime imaging with super-resolution localization microscopy, observations of single molecule dynamics, and observation of donor lifetime quenching in single-molecule imaging. These results were achieved on standard camera sensors and would not have been possible with other wide-field approaches. The throughput and photon economy of this method enables new imaging opportunities. Scanned two-photon light-sheet excitation with multi-dimensional detection will be used to achieve increased imaging depth and time-domain contrast to quantify endogenous fluorescent molecules and metabolic pathways. Multi-dimensional detection allows optimal information extraction from the limited fluorescence photon budget in the planned studies. The instrument design will enable multi-color light-sheet fluorescence lifetime imaging with up to ten different probes, and in principle greater than thirty differentiable spectro-temporal channels, that can be simultaneously measured for live intracellular localization and mapping of multiple proteins and metabolites in plants and microbes. In the initial functional application of this research program, we aim to elucidate cellular, molecular, and metabolic dynamics in the rhizosphere and cell cultures. To this end, we will assess the interactions and cross communication of engineered multi-stress tolerant microbial communities and plants in the rhizosphere. In the plant cell wall, we will visualize lignin damage and regeneration. Additionally, we will study microbial carbon dioxide fixation in the soil."

These groups expand the scope of computing to support economic growth, quality of life and national security. America needs a highly-trained workforce of computational scientists who leverage high-performance computing (HPC) to solve complex scientific and engineering problems across a variety of application fields, from national security to chemistry and physics in support of basic energy science to engineering-intensive industries such as aerospace, automotive, advanced materials and computing itself. For the past quarter century, an important participant in developing America’s advanced technological workforce has been the Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF) Program, a partnership within the DOE between the Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF) is poised, ready and necessary to meet challenging national workforce needs that arise as computational science and engineering problems continue to grow in scope and complexity. Computational science and engineering (CSE) is a multidisciplinary approach that leverages scientific computing to develop practical problem-solving methods and to supply technical tools across the scientific discovery spectrum. The Program has a particular emphasis on HPC-enabled CSE that advances science and engineering in directions important to the US Department of Energy and to the US economy in general. Over the past half-century, HPC has been an essential tool for DOE’s success. Entire science disciplines, such as biology and cosmology, have been transformed through the augmentation of scientific observation via HPC.

Duality and Strongly Interacting Systems,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020007,"Mulligan, Michael","Michael.Mulligan@theregentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,riverside","['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","The Fermi liquid theory of metals is an incredibly successful framework for understanding the physical properties of disparate materials. However, there are a variety of systems---such as the cuprate high-temperature and heavy fermion superconductors, as well as certain quasi-two dimensional systems in the vicinity of a continuous quantum phase transition---where Fermi liquid theory appears to fail. (Such phase transitions are quantum analogs of the classical liquid-gas transition; they can occur when a control parameter such as the electron density or applied magnetic field is tuned.) In this proposal, we consider various approaches aimed at improving our understanding of such non-Fermi liquid states of matter. The primary emphasis of this work is the study of anomalous low-temperature metallic behavior observed in the two-dimensional electron gas and superconducting thin films using quantum field theory dualities that have appeared in condensed matter and high energy physics. (Duality refers to the ability to describe the same physical systems in two or more distinct ways.) The quantum field theory dualities that we consider have invariances that appear to be emergent symmetries of the electron systems of interest. Such symmetries, which appear in long wavelength or low energy observables of the physical systems, occur rarely, if at all, in the phase space of real materials and, therefore, give important guidance to the development of a correct physical theory.Our focus is on the interplay of quenched disorder and a Coulomb interaction in these effective descriptions and the role of emergent symmetry in stabilizing the non-Fermi liquid metallic state. In addition, we consider the dynamics of non-Fermi liquids using three other theoretical approaches. In the first, we propose to study the behavior of non-Fermi liquid continuum effective theories which consist of a Fermi sea coupled to a gapless boson in the limit of a large number of spatial dimensions d, with the goal of understanding whether the 1/d expansion provides new insight into the behavior of these strongly interacting systems. In the second, we consider the development of superconductivity in a non-Fermi liquid normal state consisting of a lattice of excitations known as Sachdev-Yi-Kitaev quantum dots.Such models can exhibit ""strange metallic"" transport and unconventional superconductivity.What effect does the non-Fermi liquid normal state of such models have on the supeconducting transition temperature? The third approach involves anisotropic two-dimensional Fermi systems arising from coupled wires of strongly interacting one-dimensional electrons. Here we propose to study the low-energy symmetries of such systems and the construction of toy models of diffusive two-dimensional non-Fermi liquid metals. The final topic of study concerns quantum entanglement in manybody quantum systems.We are particularly interested in how entanglement that is shared between three or more subsystems, i.e., multipartite quantum entanglement, constrains the real-space structure of a quantum manybody wave function. One direction will be to study this entanglement in classes of Abelian and non-Abelian topological states of matter using the entanglement negativity, a particular bipartite measure of entanglement in mixed quantum states."

This scarcity is exacerbated by the dramatic increase in water usage due to urbanization and industrialization. The volume of high salinity wastewater, like those generated by hydraulic fracking, continues to grow and its treatment is a major environmental challenge. The recycling and reuse of water and salts from high salinity waste streams would help the environment as well as provide economic incentives. The purpose of this program is to commercialize an advanced supercritical water treatment (SCWT) process by further reducing the cost and energy consumption. By pressurizing and heating water to its supercritical state (sH2O), salts and metal inorganics are removed through precipitation and biological matter is rendered harmless. Additionally, the high energy density of the SCWT process makes the equipment compact and transportable. While these advantages of sH2O processing are known, several technical problems, including the high cost of heating and pressurizing water, have prevented the process from becoming commercial. In Phase I and II, the focus was on overcoming technical problem like salt plugging, corrosion, and energy usage, and then implementing the solutions into a continuous SCWT system. The SCWT system was operated extensively collecting data on the effect of operational settings on sweet water properties, energy usage, and cost. System parameters were optimized to make the process technically viable and commercially feasible. The SCWT system uses a novel, highly efficient, and compact heat exchanger to reduce energy consumption and has shown efficacy in producing potable water, by removing salt from high salinity streams, ranging from 3.5wt% to 18wt%. The SCWT system was operated for over 1200 hours. The data was used to upgrade system components for stable operation, without salt plugging, using materials that minimize the impact of corrosion. The technical focus of Phase IIB is to achieve additional energy saving by recovering compression energy used to pressurize the water to the supercritical conditions. During the program, the team will design, fabricate, and test a novel energy recovery device (ERD) capable of recovering 95% of the SCWT system’s compression energy. This is a similar approach to that used in reverse osmosis systems, but at significantly higher pressures. The ERD will first be built and tested at a lab prototype scale to optimize the design and performance. Then a full scale ERD will be fabricated and incorporated into the SCWT demonstration system. The SCWT will be upgraded to handle a variety of real-world waste streams at the tanker scale or commercial scale. This will demonstrate that existing technology gaps, of this Zero Liquid Discharge technology, have been overcome, promoting technology commercialization. The frack water treatment market is valued at $400B. This is just the beachhead, as the high salinity capability of the SCWT system allows entry into multiple markets. One such market, valued at $60B, is the treatment of municipal water sewage. By treating this waste stream under supercritical conditions, it can be converted into bacteria/virus free fertilizer and sold for additional revenue."
A Systems Approach to Increasing Carbon Flux to Seed Oil for Biofuels and Bioproducts Production in Camelina Sativa,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0018269,"Grotewold, Erich",Erich.Grotewold@michiganstateuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","A Systems Approach to Increasing Carbon Flux to Seed Oil for Biofuels and Bioproducts Production in Camelina sativa D.J.

Shachar-Hill, Michigan State University (Co-Investigator) K. Snell, Yield10 Bioscience (Co-Investigator) Our research plan aims to establish the non-food oilseed crop plant, Camelina sativa, as a commercially viable, dedicated biofuels and bioproducts feedstock. We will focus on improving seed and oil yields by employing an integrated genetic and metabolic systems approach to increase the rates of photosynthetic CO2 capture and conversion to triacylglycerols (TAGs). Camelina has the advantages of low agronomic inputs and natural resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses relative to other oilseed crops, and Camelina oil-based blends have been tested and approved as liquid transportation fuels. Camelina also benefits as a synthetic biology platform from a fully sequenced genome, well-established molecular genetic tools, and numerous resources available from its close relative, Arabidopsis thaliana. Despite these advantages, the major limitation in widespread adoption of Camelina as an industrial oilseed crop is its modest oil yield. Our proposal will address yield directly by employing a tissue-specific and whole-plant systems approach to identify the major regulatory mechanisms that limit 1) carbon fixation in photosynthetically active source tissues (leaves), 2) the transport of fixed carbon from source to sink tissues (seeds), and 3) the allocation of fixed carbon to TAG production. The limiting factors identified in our analyses will be individually validated and combined using multi-gene stacking and genome editing technologies to engineer Camelina. Our overall objective is to achieve up to a 300% increase per hectare in oil production, thereby meeting the yield and cost targets of a competitive biofuels and bioproducts crop while retaining its advantages for growth in marginal environments. Our research program builds on the established expertise and collaborative record of the co-PIs to develop an integrated systems-level strategy to accelerate the development of a pipeline of potential yield traits. To this end, we will combine predictive metabolic flux modeling, quantitative proteomics, and the identification of transcriptional regulatory networks with the optimization of multi-gene and genome editing synthetic biology tools to enable the efficient analysis of stacked-traits for improved seed yield and TAG production in Camelina. Newly discovered traits from the co-PI laboratories that positively impact CO2 capture, transport and allocation will serve as the initial foundation of our strategy by providing immediate candidates for multi-gene transgenic and genome editing approaches to test for additive or synergistic effects on oil yields. These traits will also serve as the platforms for performing tissue-specific and whole-plant metabolic flux and transcriptional regulatory network analyses for the development of dynamic metabolic and gene regulatory models. These predictive models will accelerate the identification of additional metabolic bottlenecks, transcriptional regulators and/or post-translational mechanisms that control seed yields. The control points identified using our systems-level models provide novel targets for engineering and yield analysis individually and in combination with our proven yield traits. Our studies will be guided by an integrated workflow plan for optimized discovery in which output from our predictive, systems-level models inform the selection and analysis of novel trait combinations. Likewise, information from our trait analysis will provide input for the further refinement of our predictive models. This results in a highly integrated and robust research plan that maximizes the potential for achieving our seed and oil yield goals."
Precision Muon Physics at Fermilab,Office of High Energy Physics,DE-SC0013895,"Roberts, Bradley",Bradley.Roberts@trusteesofbostonuniversity,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Precision Muon Physics at Fermilab Bradley Lee Roberts PD/PI James Paul Miller PI Department of Physics Boston University 590 Commonwealth Ave. Boston, MA 02215 The muon (g-2) and Mu2e experiments are each designed to search for new, as yet undiscovered physics. The muon is a heavy version of the electron, which is radioactive and decays to an electron and two neutrinos in 2.2 millionths of a second. Muons and electrons are like spinning tops, and make a magnetic field around them like a bar magnet. The strength of this magnetic field is very precisely calculated, and involves all of the known forces in nature (except gravity). The number that determines the strength of the magnet is called &ldquo;g&rdquo;, and is slightly larger than 2 by 0.1%, hence the name &ldquo;g-2&rdquo; (pronounced gee-minus-two) for the experiment. This difference between g and 2 is called the magnetic anomaly and it is an interesting quantity. The anomaly is due to quantum mechanical processes, where &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; particles flit in and out of existence. To calculate the value of the magnetic anomaly, theoretical physicists have to include the effects of all the known particles and forces. At present, the measured value of this anomaly is larger than expected from these calculations. This difference could be the first observation of effects of new, as yet undiscovered particles and forces in nature. By significantly improving on the precision of the measured value of this anomaly, we will definitively determine whether the present difference between the theoretical and experimental measurements is conclusive evidence for new physics, or not. The muon to electron conversion experiment, Mu2e, is searching for evidence that a muon can spontaneously turn into an electron, without also emitting both a neutrino and an anti-neutrino. The only things that separate muons from electrons are their masses and a quantity called flavor. We have always seen a neutrino and an anti-neutrino along with an electron when the muon decays, because, for reasons that are not understood, flavor is conserved. If a decay without an accompanying neutrino were to happen as little as one time in 1018 muon decays, this process would be detected by the Mu2e experiment. If observed, even a single event would be a major discovery in physics, and be definitive evidence for something new, beyond the Standard Theory of the subatomic world. It would open the door to a whole new world of physics that has been speculated about for decades, without any experimental evidence for its existence. These two muon experiments are world-leading and have the potential to make a major discovery that would change how we think about the subatomic world."
ENZYMOLOGY OF METHANOGENESIS: MECHANISM OF METHYL-COENZYME M REDUCTASE,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-FG02-08ER15931,"Ragsdale, Stephen",Stephen.Ragsdale@regentsoftheuniversityofmichigan,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","This project focuses on how methane is generated in nature by Methyl-Coenzyme M Reductase (MCR), the key and rate-limiting enzyme in biological methane synthesis. Methanogens produce nearly all of earth’s methane (109 tons per year globally), the primary constituent of natural gas. Accounting for 22% of U.S. energy consumption, methane is a clean fuel, emitting less sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen than coal or oil. Methanogens are archaea, and truly are masters of the metabolism of greenhouse gases because not only do they generate methane, they are responsible for annual oxidation of 108 tons of methane to carbon dioxide through the process known as reverse methanogenesis (aka) anaerobic methane oxidation. The anaerobic oxidation of methane is thermodynamically uphill and, thus, only occurs when it is coupled to a very thermodynamically favorable process. Thus, reverse methanogenesis occurs within microbial mats that also contain bacteria that catalyze sulfate, nitrate, or metal reduction. The goal of the proposed research is to determine the enzymatic mechanism of MCR, the key enzyme in both anaerobic methane synthesis and anaerobic methane oxidation. MCR catalyzes the formation of methane and the heterodisulfide, CoB-S-S-CoM, from methyl-Coenzyme M (methyl-CoM) and Coenzyme B (CoB). Coenzyme M is nature’s smallest cofactor and the covalently attached methyl group (a methyl thioether) is generated from simple one- and two-carbon compounds, like carbon dioxide, methanol and acetic acid. Uncovering how nature generates methane is critical since methane is an abundant and important fuel as well as being second only to carbon dioxide as the most prevalent greenhouse gas. Furthermore, because methane is more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide, methane’s global warming potential is 22-80-fold more potent than carbon dioxide. Thus, the work significantly impacts both our understanding of how a key energy source is generated as well as how an important greenhouse gas is metabolized. Work primarily in the PI’s lab prompted the current working hypothesis that both forward and reverse methanogenesis proceed via long-range electron transfer from a substrate (methyl-CoM and CoBSSCoM) sulfonate-Ni(I) complex through the carbon chain leading to formation of labile radical intermediates. Prior work established that MCR generates a methyl radical intermediate, whose identification “end[ed] more than two decades of controversy and set the stage for building a consensus MCR mechanism” (commentary in Science magazine by Lawton & Rosenzweig, 2016). We now have convincing evidence that the first step of the MCR forward and reverse reactions require a Ni(I)-oxo interaction between MCR and either methyl-SCoM (forward) or CoBSSCoM (reverse). This is a significant departure from the current MCR mechanism. In this project, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims. The first aim is to determine the structures of the active Ni(I) state of MCR in the absence and presence of substrates. The second aim is use analogs to trap and characterize the CoB-based radical intermediate in the first step of methane synthesis. The third aim is to use kinetic, spectroscopic and computational approaches to test our hypothesis that both forward and reverse methanogenesis proceed via long-range electron transfer from the above-mentioned substrate sulfonate-Ni(I) complex. We are in excellent position to define all remaining intermediates in this pathway, thus how nature’s catalyst activates and generates methane, one of our nation’s important fuels, methane. Successful completion of these goals will have a major impact on our understanding of the mechanism of methane synthesis and oxidation. This information should be translatable into biotechnological processes to either generate or capture methane."

Once established, they may find applications in error-protected manipulation of quantum information. Majorana modes have been the focus of extensive search in experimental condensed matter physics for the past decade. One of the promising approaches is to realize them in semiconductor nanowires coated with superconductors. While this platform nominally satisfies requirements for Majorana realization, an alternative signal called Andreev states has been found to closely resemble the Majorana signal preventing their unambiguous identification. The goal of this project is to firmly establish Majorana Zero Modes in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices. A new generation of hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials will be used that addresses the challenges experienced before through careful treatment of the nanowire surface and the creation of a sharply defined interface to a thin and smooth superconductor film. The experimental approach allows to distinguish Majorana and Andreev states from the measurements of tunneling current into nanowires. Once Majorana modes are established, this opens doors to a large number of exciting and long-awaited experiments that explore and leverage the predicted Majorana properties, from quantized conductance and teleportation to non-Abelian braiding."

Several studies point to the importance of ligand NC interactions and their effects on the overall nanoparticle exciton dynamics. Despite the large experimental and theoretical effort in NC photophysics, it remains a challenge to quantitatively connect ultrafast spectroscopy of NCs to microscopic interfacial interactions, which is crucial for validating theoretical models of charge/electron transfer at the NC interface. This presents a significant knowledge gap for developing predictive design principles to harness molecular energy capture or electron transfer in NC-catalyst assemblies and is the motivation for the proposed work. Cossairt and Khalil proposed experiments will build on their recent transient IR spectroscopy study of nanoclusters which demonstrated the sensitivity of the asymmetric carboxylate ligand vibrations to the different binding motifs of the anchoring groups on the NC surface and their direct vibronic coupling to the photogenerated exciton. In the proposed work, Cossairt will develop a series of atomically precise CdSe NCs (nanoclusters and larger quantum dots) with functionalized carboxylate ligands and other vibrational tags. Ultrafast nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy by the Khalil group on these NCs with precisely placed IR-active tags will allow us to definitively correlate how modifications in surface chemistry determine the nature of ligand-exciton vibronic coupling and the subsequent charge delocalization timescales and pathways. The collective synthetic and spectroscopic experiments will inform on how the magnitude of the vibronic coupling changes as a function of NC size and structure, surface dipole, ability of the ligand to accept the electron/hole, CdS shell thickness of CdSe/CdS heterostructures and distance from the NC surface. Using multidimensional electronic-vibrational spectroscopy to map vibronic couplings as a function of the excitonic states in the atomically precise ligand-NC platforms will allow us to develop and test models of interfacial charge transfer at the ligand-NC interface.\ Using our two-pronged hypothesis driven approach of advanced synthesis and spectroscopy, our longterm goal is to develop a synthetic platform for performing and monitoring NC photocatalysts with ultrafast IR spectroscopy."

The platform will be designed for massively parallel operation across a large number of distributed nodes with GPU-enabled speed optimization. The Phase II effort successfully developed and validated an HPC supported FDTD simulation software package, named GECkO. The resulting software includes the physics and simulation elements necessary for design of a wide variety of RF and optical devices. It also includes a complete suite of post- processing and visualization tools necessary to interpret simulation results. The software and associated tools were developed into a complete commercial software package. The current material properties dithering approach in GECkO will be replaced by an unstructured non- orthogonal mesh supplied by Coreform’s Cubit software. The HPC algorithms will be updated to allow distribution of the various grid partitions across multiple computational nodes. This software update will significantly improve GECkO’s simulation accuracy and speed. They will also provide a common platform GECkO and IERUS’s other CEM tool, V-Lox, opening the possibility of selling a combined CEM simulation suite to customers. A planned pilot deployment will provide early customer feedback and help facilitate full commercialization of the software. This design platform will be of immediate use to telecommunications innovators and to photonics and RF device design-for-manufacturing companies. It will also enable IERUS to be a design partner to commercial partners operating in these industries. The platform will be an enabling technology for developing the next generation components required to facilitate the continued Internet of Things and optical communication growth and will greatly enhance electromagnetic simulation capabilities for a wide spectrum of customers."

Large uncertainties exist in current model predictions of SOA concentrations and properties due to poor understanding and thus inadequate model representation of SOA’s sources and formation mechanisms. SOA can be formed via both gas-phase reactions (gas SOA) and aqueous-phase reactions within hydrated aerosols and cloud/fog droplets (aqueous SOA). There has been mounting evidence suggesting that aqueous SOA is abundant in the atmosphere and that aqueous SOA likely consists of molecules with distributions of molecular weight, oxygen to carbon ratio, and physical properties (light absorption, water-uptake, and volatility) that are significantly different from those of gas SOA. Cloud/fog processing is also responsible for forming aerosols in the droplet accumulation-mode diameter range, which is generally unattainable through gas-phase reactions and condensation during the typical ambient aerosol lifetime. Since aerosols’ optical and cloud nucleating properties are controlled by their composition and size distribution, a thorough understanding of the aqueous-phase chemistry of SOA is necessary for elucidating aerosol-cloud interactions and for improving accuracy in predicting aerosols’ effects on the global radiative energy budget. However, so far, the impacts of aqueous-phase chemistry on ambient SOA remain to be characterized and the treatments of aqueous SOA in regional and global models are poorly constrained. The main goal of this research is to unravel the influences that aqueous-phase chemistry has on the evolution of SOA concentration and modification of aerosol properties. We will achieve this goal by performing advanced and integrated analyses of Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) and Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) data acquired from ASR- and ARM-supported field campaigns and long-term measurement studies. The specific objectives of this research include: (1) Investigate the role of aqueous-phase chemistry in ambient SOA formation and evolution through analyses of aerosol mass spectrometer measurements and associated observations from DOE campaigns. (2) Identify and evaluate aerosol mass spectral signatures for aqueous SOA through analyses of organic matter in cloud/fog waters and ambient aerosols subjected to significant aqueous-phase processing. (3) Develop a new Multilinear Engine–based organic aerosol factor analysis value added product (ME-OAComp) to improve understanding of organic aerosol chemical climatology and aqueous SOA processes at ARM's Southern Great Plains (SGP) site. (4) Perform integrated analysis of worldwide aerosol mass spectrometry datasets to gain a broader understanding of aqueous SOA from biomass burning emissions. (5) Synthesize the results generated from Objectives (1) - (4) into phenomenological descriptions and data products against which modeling results can be evaluated. The proposed research is expected to lead to an improved and more quantitative understanding of aqueous SOA in the atmosphere and provide data products that may be useful for developing parameters and evaluating regional and global models with improved accuracy for simulating atmospheric organic aerosol concentrations and properties."

Such discharges can lead to an electrical breakdown or flashover, resulting in a complete failure of the insulation system. Currently, there is not a complete model of all the discharges that can result in the breakdown of an insulation system. For non-thermal plasma, there have been studies that focus on only one mechanism or just the transition from one discharge mechanism to another. For thermal plasma, studies have also been done focused on just the conditions following the occurrence of an electric arc or flashover. In both cases, a systematic study leading to a complete model comprising all discharge mechanisms is missing. To address this gap, a complete plasma model for both thermal and non-thermal plasmas will be developed using a hydrodynamic approach. The project aims to build the model sequentially, supported by experimental diagnostics covering a wide range of parameters. The model is expected to answer the question whether or not there will be a breakdown for a given complex geometry of electrodes and insulation systems under a given voltage waveform. The work has the potential to address industrial applications and is of great importance to higher voltage systems."
BURST DYNAMICS AND FAILURE CASCADES IN COMPLEX GEOMATERIALS: APPLICATIONS TO INDUCED AND NATURAL EARTHQUAKE SEISMICITY,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0017324,"Rundle, John","John.Rundle@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,davis","['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Burst Dynamics and Failure Cascades in Complex Geomaterials: Applications to Induced and Natural Earthquake Seismicity (A Statistical Physics Approach to Understanding the Complex Emergent Dynamics in Geological Materials) John B Rundle and James P Crutchfield, University of California, Davis Observations of rock masses over a range of spatial scales indicate that the failure modes of these systems, such as fracture and other forms of catastrophic failure demonstrate scale invariant deformation, or power law behavior, characteristic of complex non-linear systems. These are observed in both laboratory settings in acoustic emission experiments, as well as in large scale field settings associated with tectonic faults (Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency relation; Omori relation for aftershocks). One important reason for this behavior is that driven threshold systems of rock masses in which defects interact with long range interactions. This result, which was first proposed on the basis of simulations and theory, was subsequently observed in field observations on the tectonic scale. Modeling these types of processes requires consideration of fully interacting fields of dislocations, defects, damage, and other material disorder. In much of the previous work over the last decades on these types of systems, disorder fields were assumed to be non-interacting or dilute, allowing classical solid-solid mixture theories to be employed. Our fundamental hypothesis that we are investigating is: Hypothesis: Cascades of failure bursts in complex geomaterials are characterized by proximity to a critical point. In order to test or validate this hypothesis, we must address the fundamental constraint that the physical dynamics that produce the cascades are generally unobservable. We can only infer the physical dynamics from observing the events, typically the cascades, and/or space-time patterns of events, that are produced by the unobservable dynamics. This constraint then leads to the following question: Question: Can we understand underlying physical dynamics of complex geomaterials characterized by cascading bursts of failure by studying the apparent pattern dynamics of the cascade bursts directly? To answer this question, and to test our hypothesis, Our research will employ: o Comprehensive data from the events, including earthquake seismicity catalogs, GPS data, and other event-based observations that display the burst-type events o Models for the burst dynamics that produce testable observations based on theory, numerical simulations, and other quantitative measures Among the tools that we will employ to compare models to data, or to extract meaning from the data directly are the following: o Simple pattern analysis, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as well as a type of pattern dynamics and pattern informatics that we have discussed in previous research conducted under DoE grants o Theoretical analysis of spinodal nucleation phenomena in mean field and near-mean field systems, as discussed in previous research o Extraction and analysis of Shannon information entropy provided by the event data directly Machine learning methods for both supervised and unsupervised learning, which may include linear regression, bootstrap methods, hidden Markov methods, support vector machines, artificial neural networks including deep learning, pattern classifiers, decision trees and random forests. Much of this machinery is readily available in open source Python packages, that can easily be integrated into the Python workflow that we have previously established in the current research efforts"
A new approach to the interacting phonon problem,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0016507,"Marianetti, Chris",Chris.Marianetti@thetrusteesofcolumbiauniversityinthecityofnewyork(morningsidecampus),"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","A New Approach to the Interacting Phonon Problem Chris Marianetti, Columbia University, New York (Principal Investigator) Phonons and their interactions may dictate many materials properties, including phase stability, thermal transport, mechanical behavior, optical properties, etc. Additionally, the nonlinear aspects of lattice dynamics probes a forefront of both classical dynamical systems and the Bosonic many-body problem. There are various observed experimental phenomena related to phonon interactions, such as intrinsically localized modes, which require additional theoretical understanding and could have technological relevance. In order to be able to successfully predict materials properties at a wide range of temperatures and to understand experimental anomalies, the Hamiltonian for phonons and their interactions must be reliably computed from first-principles and solved efficiently yet accurately. Our recently developed Lone Irreducible Derivative (LID) and Bundled Irreducible Derivative (BID) approaches provide the most efficient possible algorithm for computing phonons and their interactions from finite displacements; and we plan to further enhance and apply these new approaches to a broad range of crystalline materials using a variety of different first-principles approaches. A large collection of phonon interactions up to fourth order will be assembled, characterized, and disseminated; finally bringing ubiquity to phonon interactions in high symmetry crystals. Methodological improvements will include the computation of strain derivatives of all phonons and their interactions, which are critical for constant pressure scenarios; introduction of universal conventions for our symmetrization algorithms, which is essential for reproducibility; development of an optimal measurement basis in the BID approach; and the release of an open-source software suite to bring our methods to the scientific community. Applications will range from weakly correlated systems which are well characterized, such as aluminum, to strongly correlated transition metal oxides which are less well understood. This proposal is timely given that experimental measurement of phonon spectra continue to generate exponentially more data due to the numerous sophisticated neutron scattering facilities such as the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Lab. A general, reliable theoretical framework which can efficiently predict phonon related phenomena as a function of temperature is essential. Our LID/BID approaches are more than an order of magnitude faster than conventional finite displacement approaches, and further methodological and software development will allow our methods to be used by all practitioners; bringing a transformational change to all sub-fields which rely on phonons and their interactions."
Collaborative Research: Understanding the role of polymer topology on molecular deformation and scission under extreme shear using in situ neutron scattering,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021294,"Underhill, Patrick",Patrick.Underhill@rensselaerpolytechnicinstitute,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Flow processes for engineered polymers in energy production, efficiency, and recycling/upcycling can experience extreme deformation rates that can break chemical bonds along the polymer backbone, leading to mechanical degradation and compromised performance. Modern approaches to engineer this behavior involve the design of topologically complex polymers including branched and star-like architectures. However, previously established relationships between topology and extreme shear rheology of polymers have remained largely empirical due to a lack of methods to characterize fluid and molecular microstructure in extreme flows. The proposed research aims to fill this gap by developing mechanistic, molecular-scale understanding for how topology affects polymer deformation at very high shear rates, and how this deformation drives the breakage of chemical bonds along the polymer. This will be achieved through in situ small angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements and parameter-matched molecular simulations and scattering models that can resolve single-molecule deformations of polymers at extreme shear rates, which will be applied to families of topologically complex polymers where synthetic control will be used to understand how the type and degree of branching on a polymer influence the distribution of molecular deformation and tension at extreme shear rates. Results will be combined with theories for the chemical kinetics of chemical bond scission under tension to generate an in silico model to predict the mechanical degradation of polymers observed in ex situ experiments. Ultimately, these studies will provide guidelines for engineering polymers to enhance mechanical stability, or conversely to engineer flows that direct the mechanical degradation of polymers for targeted materials properties and applications. This project critically leverages a recently developed in situ neutron scattering technique for SANS in high shear rate flows, called capillary rheo-SANS, which will be disseminated to the national neutron scattering community through established collaborations with beam scientists at neutron sources."

Biomolecules, including proteins and lipids, can be co-assembled with synthetic molecules that mimic biomolecules into complex structures. These structures assemble and dissemble when the environment, including the concentration of the components and the ionic strength of the solution change. To mimic biomolecular functionalities and understand the organization of molecules in living systems, the investigators for this project propose to design and characterize various assemblies of charged and chiral molecules that mimic biological assemblies. The team of computational and experimental scientists will use these molecules as well as mutated proteins to organize proteins into specific structures that facilitate the catalytic activity of enzymes. Specifically, the design of amphiphilic molecules with different aminoacidic head groups and hydrophobic tails will be organized into complex architectures, which are observed in biological systems including sheets rolled up into closed tubes or into open snail shell structures, termed cochleates. Transformations between different morphologies will be triggered by modifying intermolecular electrostatic interactions via changes in the ionic conditions of the solution that contains the molecules of interest. Assemblies of proteins with amphiphiles will be achieved by adsorbing globular proteins with complex shapes that also have polar, charged and non-polar (i.e., hydrophobic and hydrophilic) surface domains onto lipid bilayers. These bilayers will be designed to have specific charge densities to favor protein adsorption. The goal is to learn to control the organization, including orientation and packing density of proteins on surfaces with different surface charge densities. The team will also analyze assemblies of proteins into microcompartments. Microcompartments are found in a wide variety of bacterial species. They are involved in breaking down nutrients with the release of energy. The shell, which is made by proteins, and the cargo self-assemble using different pathways. Theoretical and computational models will be developed to understand how assemblies of different proteins organize into sheets, tubes, and polyhedral microcompartments as a function of the properties of the proteins such as surface charge density and distribution of hydrophobic and polar groups and the concentrations of different proteins in the presence and in the absence of cargo. The basic science questions that will be addressed include how the molecular organization affects the elastic properties of the assemblies and the resulting mesoscale structures. In addition, these studies will reveal how to control the assemblies by modifying the fundamental interactions, including electrostatic interactions and how the chirality of the molecules and assemblies affect the stability of mesoscale structures."

The primary goal of congestion control is to avoid congestion overload on the network while effectively utilizing the available transmission capacity for reliable end-to-end (e2e) transport. Congestion control in today’s Internet is overwhelmingly based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) at the transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Many versions of TCP congestion control/avoidance methods have been researched and implemented over the years to achieve optimized performance. Although many of these versions served well in many cases, the emergence of new Internet applications (e.g., large-scale data transfer, replication, backup, real-time AR/VR communications, etc.) as well as very-high-speed communication (e.g., optical) links require innovative ideas to further enhance the transport-layer protocol. Many transport protocols try to optimize congestion-control algorithms by operating the congestion window in a range which maximizes inflight data. Some of these algorithms are based on loss rate, some are based on round-trip delays, and a recent one from Google is congestion based. Various studies show the shortcomings of these approaches in different scenarios. Thus, transport-layer congestion control needs an intelligent and dynamic evolution to support next-generation, high-throughput applications over e2e network paths with a wide range of network conditions (e.g., various packet-loss rates and/or Round-Trip Times (RTTs)). [Note that these e2e paths can include not only high-speed network links (with low or negligible loss rates) but also low-quality (i.e., lossy) access links.] Also, innovations on transport layer should be related to the TCP/IP stack, so that new solutions are backward-compatible. Accordingly, Ennetix is developing an experimental transport protocol, called Intelligent Transport Proto- col (ITP), which employs multiple learn-and-infer techniques (based on Machine Learning (ML)) in congestion control and network coding for forward-error correction at the transport layer (as traditional acknowledgement- based backward-error correction is too slow for high-throughput applications). ITP operates the congestion window at optimal level by estimating and inferring parameters based on historical data using ML techniques. ITP reduces (i.e., masks over) e2e loss rate (even if it is high) at transport stack by intelligently employing (a) network coding and (b) buffer management by predicting parameters based on estimated network conditions, thereby leading to a more linear response to changes in loss rate and RTT. During Phase I of this SBIR project, requirements analysis and design of the ITP platform architecture were conducted, a working prototype was developed, and evaluation studies have been performed to determine ITP’s performance and feasibility to support the ultra-fast transport requirements of the next generation of Internet applications. These feasibility and performance evaluation studies have been accomplished over live networks at Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Ennetix office. Outcomes of the Phase I R&D efforts and evaluation studies have confirmed the viability of ITP as a commercial-grade transport-protocol platform. In this Phase II project (as a continuation of Phase I), the goal is to significantly expand ITP with advanced performance models and forecasting methods in congestion-control algorithms, scalable and intelligent network coding, and programmable interfaces for extensibility. A commercial-grade ITP solution will be developed, with which network operators can build networking infrastructures for the next-generation Internet. Early field trials will demonstrate the functionalities and performance of ITP over live networks and pave the way for successful market entry and deployment on premier R&E networks such as ESnet. ITP will greatly benefit network users at DOE and other government organizations through an innovative transport protocol which will provide much higher throughput in today’s cloud-based, dynamic, and distributed environments with various RTTs and loss rates. The wider benefits of this effort will extend well beyond the immediate DOE scientific community, and on to common Internet users, other enterprises, and service providers. In particular, many commercial cloud-service providers and enterprises can leverage ITP to implement new use cases and support the next generations of Internet applications."

Due to the lack of cost effective approaches to remove the water from fine coal, needed in order to burn it in a conventional boiler, the coal producers often choose to discard the fine coal. There is already approximately 4 billion tons of fine coal waste in the U.S. and another 70~90 million tons is being produced every year. A unique process for the direct combustion of the wet fine coal, without further dewatering, is developed. Bench-scale testing has already been conducted in the Phase I and Phase II projects. Pilot-scale demonstrations will be conducted and the process’s economic advantages will be quantified in Phase IIA. In Phase II, a pumpable coal water slurry with 62.5% solid loading was prepared from real fine coal and slurry production was scaled up by a factor of 12. A burner designed for this process and a bench-scale combustor were constructed in the lab. In the combustion tests, a 17-kW self- sustained slurry flame burned stably in air and the fuel burnout was 95%. A computational fluid dynamics model was developed to simulate the slurry combustion process. With a newly constructed burner, this technology will be further demonstrated at the 100-kW level at an existing pilot-scale facility. The computational fluid dynamics model of the slurry combustion process will be updated after the pilot data is acquired. Furthermore, a techno-economic analysis of retrofitting a circulating fluidized bed boiler with this technology will be conducted to show the cost benefits. This technology can be applied to retrofit existing power plants or build new power plants at location close to the fine coal. With this new technology, the 4 billion tons of currently unusable fuel can be turned into electricity and its negative effect on environment is minimized."

These processes evolve on ultrafast time scales on the order of millionth of a billionth of a second, i.e. femtoseconds or shorter. The physical mechanisms underlying the charge and energy transfer involve quantum mechanical electronic correlations and coupled electron-nuclear motions. By virtue of the excellent time-resolution, attosecond extreme ultraviolet and x-ray pulses in conjunction with femtosecond infrared fields form an ideal tool to study and control these electronic processes. This project uses tunable laser fields to provide new control knobs for monitoring and controlling the electronic and nuclear dynamics. The long-term objective of these studies is to tailor the coherent evolution of charges, thus directing the chemical reactivity of the molecules. Specifically, multi-color pump-probe experiments: 1) probe autoionization dynamics, 2) control electron-nuclear couplings, 3) understand electron-core interactions, and 4) initiate and probe the hole migration. The experiments implement attosecond extreme ultraviolet or soft-x-ray excitation alongside multi-pulse, wavelength-tunable, femtosecond laser fields ranging from visible to mid-infrared, for independent control and probing functions. These systematic investigations aim for light-induced modification of electron dynamics. The interpretation and modeling of the experimental results entail collaboration with theorists. This research explores strategies for controlling the charge and energy redistribution in molecules, which in-turn can empower the development of transformative approaches for light harvesting, energy conversion, and catalysis – topics that are of immense importance to the society."

Even today’s best methods for high-profile problems, like simulating automotive crashes, require millions of dollars of manual labor to set up each simulation. These current methods are so expensive because they require translating each Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model to a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model prior to simulation. This translation process is time-consuming, tedious, and frustrating even for seasoned veterans. In the end, after the analysis model is so laboriously constructed, it often fails to perform robustly and instead produces low-fidelity or erroneous results, and then serves limited use in improving the design. The company has extensive domain experience that enables them to deliver fundamentally new approaches to CAD and FEA, wrapped in a novel, high-performance computing (HPC) framework. The revolutionary technology developed through this SBIR allows CAD data to be transformed into an analysis-suitable state far more quickly than traditional approaches allow. It also promises to accelerate simulations times by up to 500x and return more accurate results, to better inform design improvements. The approach will deliver scalable solutions through an intuitive and simple-to-use interface, Coreform IGA. The team has previously founded, grown and exited a company in this space and is well prepared to bring the products to success. In Phase II, the patent-pending isogeometric analysis (IGA) technology was significantly matured and demonstrated promising simulation results. The Coreform IGA software was released. The team gained insight from potential customers in the automotive and defense industries regarding the most impactful entry point into their workflows, helping to define Phase IIB. The team will work closely with two global customers who are contributing matching funds to this project. We will mature Coreform IGA to be ready for production at their sites in year one and expand into other customers’ sites in year two. The team will mature the patent-pending IGA technology, expand the range of physics available, and enhance the technology to fully leverage HPC. Customer-proposed benchmark problems will be used at all stages to verify the approach. The proposed methodology will remove error-prone parts of the simulation workflow and improve simulation fidelity, simplifying the user experience and allowing engineers of all experience levels to run analyses. This work translates into accurate data, betters outcomes and savings of millions of dollars per project. The final toolset will provide accurate designs across multiple industries and reduce time to market with considerable cost savings."

One of the primary requirements for tritium self-sufficiency, as well as to ensure low plant tritium release to the external environment, is to minimize the tritium loss through the internal components, which requires accurate predictions of the tritium behavior for a wide range of materials and system conditions. This proposal addresses the lack of a comprehensive model which accounts for particular conditions, such as the significance of temperature fields and neutronics information, and the systematic uncertainty quantification of associated material properties that impact tritium generation, utilization, and loss mechanisms in the blanket. Our application directly supports several areas identified in the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee (FESAC) report [[i]]. Specifically, we support Fusion Power Plant (FPP) System Design and Integration. The two areas of the FESAC we directly support are: · Advancement of multi-scale, multi-physics theory and modeling capabilities necessary to predict the complex interactions between numerous plasma, material, and engineering processes that will occur within a FPP. · Accelerated progress and increase in readiness of multiple systems are needed to safely design and operate a fusion reactor. The technical work we are proposing is well aligned with the following recommendations of the FESAC report: · Significantly expand blanket and tritium research and development programs. · Maturation of pre-conceptual designs, scope, and costing for proposed new experimental facilities should be part of regular program activities. Our efforts are focused directly on technical areas that are identified as major cost drivers for fusion power plants [[ii]]: tritium breeding capability, attainable thermal efficiency, and achievable neutron wall loading. The proposed efforts will use state-of-the-art and next-generation modeling and simulation, coupled with sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, to quantify and reduce uncertainties in these cost drivers for fusion power plants. Additionally, operational modality (pulsed versus steady state) is another important cost driver. We will directly address this by developing tools that will help us to design fusion power plants for operational scenarios, and can be used to provide reliable assessments of operational paradigms and approaches, including anticipated operational occurrences. We will also work with credible U.S. fusion vendors to perform independent assessments of their technology concepts (for example, General Atomics).

Our goal is to better understand physical processes, focusing on aerosol-cloud interactions, that occur in mountain regions by deploying a novel network of miniaturized instrumentation in a Colorado mountain valley. The measurements will take place during the Surface Atmosphere Integrated Field Laboratory (SAIL) campaign, which will be providing vital observations of cloud properties and precipitation, among other key measurements.

Functional Group Effects on Unimolecular QOOH Reactions at High Pressure using High-Resolution Electronic Absorption Spectroscopy,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021337,"Rotavera, Brandon","Brandon.Rotavera@theuniversityofgeorgiaresearchfoundation,inc.","['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Motivation: The development of advanced combustion systems relies on an understanding of the chemical kinetics controlling hydrocarbon oxidation – a process that governs ignition timing and heat-release rates. The degree to which this understanding is useful depends on the ability to simulate combustion over practical conditions using numerical chemical kinetics models, the efficacy of which hinges on validation against detailed experimental data. Of particular importance is high-pressure speciation data involving Q? OOH radicals, centerpieces of hydrocarbon oxidation, which react either through unimolecular pathways or second O2-addition pathways. Unimolecular pathways produce a large number of complex isomers, e.g. cyclic ethers, and the latter pathways are responsible for ketohydroperoxides (KHP) that promote chain- branching and autoignition. The balance of these reactions dictates global chemical reactivity and is highly dependent on molecular structure. Given the complexity and abundance of isomers formed in these reactions, new spectroscopy diagnostics are utilized in this work to resolve the identities of species from these two pathways and to unravel fundamental Q? OOH chemistry. Methods: This work utilizes a high-pressure JSR operated from 500 – 1200 K, and up to 50 atm, to produce isomer-resolved speciation measurements. Oxidation experiments will be conducted on diethyl ether, butanone, tetrahydrofuran, 1-butanol, and n-butane chosen to systematically study functional group effects on branching of Q?OOH produced from C4 species. This will be achieved using a new, state-of-the-art electronic absorption spectroscopy diagnostic that operates from 5.16 – 9.92 eV with high resolution (0.001 eV). Since electronic transitions are highly sensitive to molecular structure, this approach is capable of revealing the identity of previously undetected species formed from Q?OOH. Recent publications note that knowledge of such species is lacking and, importantly, are major sources of model uncertainty. Objectives: The hypothesis-driven chemistry in this proposal centers on discovering the influence functional groups impose on unimolecular reactions of Q?OOH radicals at high pressure, including changes in selectivity towards cyclic ethers or decomposition via concerted C–C/C–O-scission, and how these reactions are affected by functional group proximity to the carbon-centered radical site. Project Description: Because of the dearth of insight on product formation from Q?OOH, particularly at high-pressure, rate parameters and resulting branching ratios in chemical kinetics models are commonly based on approximations, either empirical- or ab initio-based rate rules. It is shown in this proposal that uncertainties in these approximations, for just one subset of reactions (Q?OOH ? products), can alter ignition delay times up to a factor of 5, and drastically change the temperature dependence of species concentration profiles such that reliable predictions are not possible. The knowledge gap this proposal fills is the connection between the molecular structure of, and product formation from, Q? OOH at high pressure and related impact on the fidelity of combustion models, which show appreciable sensitivity to these small subsets of reactions. Fundamental questions that provide the basis for the hypothesis above include: (1) What impact does pressure have on measured product ratios of unimolecular Q?OOH decomposition? (2) How do Q? OOH product ratios change due to carbonyl, hydroxyl, or ether functional groups? (3) Are alternative unimolecular Q?OOH reaction pathways in functionalized hydrocarbons important? Potential Impact: This research will produce fundamental gas-phase reaction mechanism insight relevant to ongoing quantum chemical and detailed chemical kinetics model development efforts on biofuel oxidation chemistry in the DOE BES program and, in specific, the Gas-Phase Chemical Physics program. Examples include quantification of species from alternative reactions of Q? OOH, e.g. concerted H-transfer and O–O scission involving the –OOH group, and the study of non-Boltzmann distribution effects in Q? OOH decomposition, which may be quantified using the high-pressure, isomer-resolved speciation measurements from the JSR at the University of Georgia (UGA) in collaboration with Argonne National laboratory."

Klausen, Johns Hopkins University (Principal Investigator) Hierarchical materials are forms of matter with defined levels of organization at multiple length scales. Hierarchical materials are also a unique approach to harnessing complex functionality across multiple length scales, allowing the emergence of unique properties not accessible from the individual components. While nature has perfected the multi-length scale synthesis and assembly of biological macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, control of energy-relevant synthetic inorganic and organic hierarchical materials remains an enormous challenge for energy science. This project describes strategies enabling the design and preparation of silicon-based hybrid materials across multiple length scales. Silicon is a transformative energy-relevant material and the technical and cultural revolutions arising from silicon microelectronics and silicon solar cells cannot be understated. Critical energy-relevant semiconductor properties such as light absorption and emission, electron transport, and stability are length-dependent. The preparation of well-defined hierarchical silicon materials is largely unexplored. A key component of our strategy to address these knowledge gaps is our prior BES-supported work on novel silicon “building blocks” called cyclosilanes. Much as a single brick can be used to construct diverse building architectures, we will elaborate cyclosilanes to novel polymers (linear and cyclic), as well as hybrid materials, composites, and solids while achieving multiple hierarchical levels of structural control. Achieving our objectives will lead to understanding of how to design materials architectures and structure-dependent properties from the atomistic to the systems level, thereby addressing critical technical questions in silicon. Our study will also provide insights into how to harness emergent properties in complex materials."

High-purity therapeutic isotope products are essential for high-yield protein radiolabeling for radiopharmaceutical use. This project will develop a system to automate the production of alpha-emitting therapeutic radionuclides such as astatine-211. These radionuclides have been identified as candidates in the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma, and micro-metastatic disease. Existing manual methods are tedious, time consuming and pose radiological dose risks to technicians. Furthermore, automated systems provide a means of autonomous, remote operations that are essential in preparation of high levels of radioactive materials within enclosed spaces (e.g., hot cells and glove boxes). During phase I, the feasibility of three of the unit operations in the astatine-211 preparation scheme were demonstrated and these were integrated into a functioning Engineering Development Model. In the next phase of this endeavor, all the unit operations in the multi-step chemical purification protocol will be engineered for inclusion in an integrated and automated Advanced Development Model suited for testing by early adopters of the technology. Diagnostic sensors and software controls will be developed and incorporated to ensure that the final system meets the standards of current Good Laboratory Practices. Specifically, steps that include target dissolution, acid conversion, solid phase extraction, purified product neutralization, de-watering and antibody labelling in the conceived astatine-211 preparation process will be studied. Once these unit operations are developed and the complete system engineered and constructed, the resulting systems will be deployed at selected cyclotron facilities around the country that can produce astatine-211 to facilitate research and clinical studies on the efficacy of these radio pharmaceuticals. A dispersed network of facilities capable of producing these radioisotopes is essential because of the short half-life (7.2 hours) of the isotope of interest. To be useful as a therapeutic agent, chemical preparation of the isotope must occur close to where it will be used. By automating the preparation process, the routine supply of this isotope, first for research and clinical studies, and eventually for routine patient treatment, will be realized. Initial marketing of this system will be directed at domestic use, and thereafter, its usefulness to an international market will also be pursued."
Boron Nitride Nanotube Vibration Damping for SRF Structures,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0018489,"Whitney, Roy","Roy.Whitney@bnnt,llc","['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Boron Nitride Nanotube Vibration Damping for SRF Structures—BNNT, LLC, 300 Ed Wright Lane Suite A, Newport News, VA 23606-4384 Roy Whitney, Principal Investigator, rrwhitney@bnnt.com Stacy Jarrell, Business Official, stacyjarrell@bnnt.com Amount: $1,099,791.00 Controlling microphonics that create length oscillations in the structures that accelerate particles in Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) accelerators requires costly RF power for both capital and operating expenses above what is otherwise required for accelerating the particles. Passive viscoelastic vibration damping at cryogenic temperatures of 2 Kelvin (K) provided by our boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) provide a cost-effective alternative to enhance management of the microphonics. Our SBIR Phase I successfully proved the soundness of this approach. Since then, our in-progress SBIR Initial Phase II has already successfully proven BNNT vibration damping in both SRF cavities of the pair in which it was installed, in a pre-shipment SLAC LCLS-II cryomodule at 2 K and intends to further prove similar vibration damping in a Jefferson Lab C100 cryomodule cavity pair in the horizontal test bed (though delayed by JLab amid pandemic circumstances). An assemblage of BNNT mats, each the size of a small postage stamp, has been observed to provide this exceptional viscoelastic behavior at 2 K, consequently, reduce the RF power requirements, and enhance performance and significantly increase uptime of SRF systems. We can assist Jefferson Lab’s planned program to improve its C100 cryomodules to enhance CEBAF accelerator performance, and SLAC’s energy upgrade from LCLS-II to LCLS-II-HE. While the fundamental physics is identical, engineering for each design is unique to allow testing and accurate data. In Phase IIA, we propose to complete the original full C100 scope commitments with JLab, to fully prove results in real-world conditions in all eight cavities simultaneously, which will encourage commercialization into all C100s in the upgrade program and to complete the cavity demonstrations by updating the proven LCLS-II designs for cavities in LCLS-II-HE cryomodules. We have developed very recently improved processed BNNT material with enhanced vibration damping characteristics to be used for both the C100 and LCLS- II-HE cryomodules. The development of BNNT based viscoelastic vibration damping at cryogenic temperatures will find commercial applications in quantum computers, cryocooled sensors, liquified-gas plants, and transportation (e.g., liquified natural gas (LNG), liquid nitrogen (LN), and liquid oxygen (LOx)). Space vehicles use liquid hydrogen, densified liquid methane, LOx, etc. and have significant vibration challenges, especially during launch, along with engine components having vibrations at very high temperatures. BNNT also survive temperatures exceeding 1000 °C. Additionally, there is a significant industry for vibration-sensitive cryogenically-cooled test equipment."
Missing Links in Biological Methane and Ammonia Oxidation,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0016284,"Rosenzweig, Amy",Amy.Rosenzweig@northwesternuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Missing links in biological methane and ammonia oxidation Amy C. Rosenzweig Northwestern University Methanotrophic bacteria oxidize methane to methanol in the first step of their metabolic pathway. Whereas current catalysts that can selectively activate the 105 kcal mol-1 C-H bond in methane require high temperatures and pressures, methanotrophs perform this chemistry under ambient conditions using methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes. The membrane-bound MMO (pMMO), which utilizes a copper active site, is the predominant methane oxidation catalyst in nature; some methanotrophs can also produce a soluble iron-containing enzyme (sMMO). MMOs have received much attention for their potential applications in the development of new biological gas-to-liquids processes. The pMMO homolog ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) converts ammonia to hydroxylamine in nitrifying bacteria. Despite extensive efforts, work on pMMO and AMO has been hindered for the past 30 years by reduced enzymatic activity upon isolation from the native organisms. One explanation for this loss of activity is that there are unidentified protein components or &ldquo;missing links&rdquo; that facilitate loading, assembly, and stabilization of the active sites and/or delivery of reductants and protons. The goals of this project are to characterize recently identified candidates for these missing links and to determine their roles in biological methane oxidation. The experimental plan combines genetic and biochemical approaches with bioinformatics, spectroscopy, imaging, X-ray crystallography, and other biophysical tools. The resultant data will provide new insight into pMMO active site chemistry and redox reactivity. The deployment of pMMO and/or methanotrophs in bioconversion processes requires improved energy efficiencies, carbon yields, and reaction rates, which may be achieved through engineering of methanotrophs, optimization of pMMO, and expression of pMMO in heterologous hosts. Such efforts would be facilitated by a detailed understanding of pMMO function and mechanism, and would be impacted dramatically by the elucidation of new protein components that affect pMMO activity. Moreover, this work has the potential to further understanding of nitrification by AMO, another important target in the biological energy transduction arena."

This project focuses on developing and applying quantum simulation approaches. We will consider how advances in artificial intelligence (machine learning) might be exploited to improve quantum simulations. Our methods will be applied to layered and magnetic materials, and to novel superconductors. A key linking element in these objectives is the effort to generate new quantum states, either through construction of an appropriate heterostructure material, the inclusion of multiple interactions, or via dynamics. Together, these objectives represent an important and ambitious agenda at the forefront of computational quantum many-body physics, and build coherently on our work in the previous project period."

Jefferson Lab (JLab) probes the most basic building of matter: atomic nuclei, nucleons, quarks and gluons, with the goal to better understand these particles and the forces that bind them. The experiments performed at JLab using the unique Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, recently upgraded to 12 GeV electron energy, require theoretical support in diverse areas covered by JLab’s physics program. The members of the ODU Nuclear Theory Group are part of this theory support team. Their research covers several areas of theoretical nuclear physics. On the quark and gluon level, the study of various aspects of the strong interactions is based on the fundamental theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Due to asymptotic freedom of QCD, the effective coupling constant of the quark-gluon interaction vanishes at large momentum transfers. This allows to use perturbation theory at short distances. However, since quarks and gluons do not exist in a free state, the calculable amplitudes should be accompanied by matrix elements accumulating information about long-distance dynamics. These are described by parton distribution functions, distribution amplitudes, form factors, and Generalized Parton Distributions. The studies of I. Balitsky are related to physics programs at proposed higher-energy facilities, such as an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The research plan concentrates on the study of the kinematical region where the energy is high but the masses and transverse momenta of produced particles are relatively small. This is the domain of small-x/saturation physics, and also relies on transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization schemes. We also to study the TMD factorization at high energies and the evolution of the gluon TMDs, in particular, to analyze the one-loop correction to the TMD factorization. It is also planned to generalize the method to particle production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. The main direction of research by A. Radyushkin is the study of parton distribution functions (PDFs) within the formalism of parton pseudo-distributions (pseudo-PDFs) developed in his recent papers. The pseudo-PDF approach provides a new way to lattice PDF extractions, alternative to the quasi-PDF approach proposed in 2013 by X. Ji . The pseudo-PDF approach was successfully used recently in calculation of PDFs of the proton and pion. Studies in progress include lattice simulations of the gluon PDFs, and also of the pion distribution amplitude and generalized parton distributions. On the level of nuclei, the research of R. Schiavilla deals with the fundamental issues of understanding the structure and dynamics of nuclei in terms of the many-body strong forces governing the interactions among their constituents, the nucleons. In this context, the emergence, over the last two decades of chiral effective theory (?EFT) has led to a new phase in the evolution of the basic model. While the conventional formulation of the basic model adopted in the past relied on an expansion in terms of exchanges of heavier and heavier mesons, the ?EFT formulation has, by contrast, an expansion in powers of pion momenta as its organizing principle, directly rooted in QCD. Specific research projects pursued in the next few years include: leading and subleading three-nucleon chiral interactions and their role in the spectra of light- and intermediate-mass nuclei and the properties of nuclear/neutron matter; low-energy weak transitions in nuclei and neutrino response induced by neutral and charged weak currents. The studies of J.W. Van Orden include the application of relativistic models to electron and neutrino scattering from the deuteron and oxygen, the targets that are often used in scattering experiments at Jefferson Lab, Fermilab, and other facilities. The recently initiated calculation of ? (D)->(pn)? neutral current reaction will be continued, with particular attention to kinematic dependence and the sensitivity of the reaction to the choice of the deuteron wave functions and to isovector and isoscalar form factors. A considerable amount of effort will be addressed to the study of theoretical aspects of semi-inclusive CC? reactions."
"What is the Matter Within Polaritons:  Molecular Control of Collective Hybrid States 


",Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021941,"Musser, Andrew",Andrew.Musser@cornelluniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","When carbon-based organic semiconductors emit or absorb light, a discreet event occurs in which energy is exchanged between particles of light (a photon) and electrical current (an electron). Instead of such discreet jumps, it is possible to make devices in which the photons and electrons mix together, forming entirely new hybrid states called polaritons. This can be done by placing certain molecular materials between two very closely spaced mirrors in a microcavity. The mirrors act like miniature boxes and trap photons, allowing them to interact and combine with electrons in the semiconductor. The resulting states blend the character of the two parent particles, leading to entirely new behaviors ranging from enhanced conductivity and energy transport to altered chemical reactivity. This approach holds the promise to rewrite molecules’ energy landscape and tune their functional properties at will, without recourse to laborious synthetic chemistry. Yet fundamental questions about this concept prevent its application: What properties does the polariton inherit from the parent molecules? How can we influence these behaviors with molecular structure? This research will tackle these questions and develop a detailed understanding of how the complexity of organic semiconductors can be harnessed to control polariton behavior. The effort calls for cutting-edge laser spectroscopies to record the ultrafast processes inside the microcavity, systematically correlated with the properties of the parent organic semiconductor. This work will lead to new, fundamental understanding of the nature of both molecular materials and light-matter interactions, paving the way to a future where we can non-synthetically rewrite molecules’ properties. Moreover, the principles uncovered will spur new approaches to exploit polaritons for more energy-efficient light-emitting and light-harvesting systems and open new opportunities from photocatalysis and sensing to room-temperature quantum devices."

Yakobson Department of Materials Science & Nanoengineering, and Department of Chemistry, Rice University, Houston, TX Following the excitement of graphene discovery, the research in the 2D-materials “beyond graphene” remains broad and deep. Broad is the scope of dozens of very different chemically yet all promising compositions: transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD or MX2, by stoichiometry), white graphene (h-BN), phosphorene (2D P), silicene (Si), stanine (Sn), MAXenes, recently borophene (2D B), and more. Deep is the type of fundamental questions being asked, from optoelectronic and catalysis to morphology and defects, and—in present project—the understanding of synthetic principles and guidance through the quantitative growth models. The latter, together with often necessary added processing (e.g., liftoff-transfer or stacking of the synthesized layers) is in the focus of our work. The scope of theoretical exploration is intentionally diverse across the materials: discovering the regularities in one case can be transferred to others, while revealing the differences further adds valuable insight, new basic science across the material families. The quest for 2D materials raises a number of compelling questions about the ways of making such layers. The exfoliation from natural bulk precursors (if such exist, like in the cases of graphite-->graphene, black phosphorus-->phosphorene) is not scalable. On the other hand, their synthesis through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) involves complex gas-solid chemistry. Even when it works empirically, its theoretical understanding in many ways remains in infancy, preventing sentient design. This is the direction we embarked to explore. Besides the specific material choices, the key questions we seek to answer are: (I) What is the gas-phase path of transformations, from feedstock to the ultimate precursor units joining the growing crystal? This should shed light on syntheses of all TMD family, h-BN (hexagonal boron nitride) and others, including even most studied graphene. It may also enable the CVD approach for borophene, if proper chemical precursors were discovered. (II) What are then the elementary reactions at the edge of 2D islands defining the speed of this edge expansion, as well as kinetic shapes? (III) The energy balance between the growing material intrinsic bonding versus its interaction with the substrate, how it can favor 2D against competing nucleation into 3D-crystal? (IV) How the steps on the substrate, of either vicinal nature or from fundamentally-present roughness, can facilitate the nucleation, by reducing its dimensionality to 1D and then expand to 2D, while avoiding 3D entirely. We explore how these ideas play out on several selected materials, while achieving overall synergy. (i) The TMD family, its poster child MoS2, with the focus on gas-phase precursor, its formation from the solids-feedstock, including effects of salt-promoters, and what is exact concerted reaction of its incorporation into growing 2D-lattice. (ii) Graphene, where recent success with large-area monocrystal synthesis, especially via evolutionary selection, compels us to develop quantitative theory, explore other factors for front-localization, possibility of bilayer or few-layer synthesis. Further, we will include study of bilayer-->diamane transformation, where kinetics of nucleation remains unknown so far. (iii) h-BN, especially the challenge of guiding unidirectional nucleation in order to achieve synthesis of single crystal material (highly sought for as wide bandgap insulator, to complement semi-metal graphene). Role of substrate steps, as well as determination of precursor will be in focus. (iv) For borophene, main challenges define the research tasks: possibility of nucleation and growth on weakly-binding, non-metal substrates, and revisiting possible CVD precursors and conditions, to enable facile synthesis currently restricted to molecular beam epitaxy. (v) We will keep an eye out for what we group as “emergent or exotic” materials as well as growth on nonplanar substrates, including tubular hybrids. The benefit from the proposed effort will be in both conceptual and quantitative developments in 2D materials synthesis, with impact on its theory and entire field, to facilitate efficient production of known and discovery of not yet existing materials, for applications in catalysis, electronics, sustainable energy systems, optics, information technology and quantum computing hardware."

Such an investigation is important not only for fundamental reasons, since it is expected to shed light on the enigmatic role of electron correlations in these novel materials, but also because of possible energy efficient optoelectronic, spintronics, and quantum information science applications. Two types of materials will be targeted: 1) low dimensional semiconductors; 2) Mott-like systems displaying phase transition. Long-range, reduced Coulomb screening may be the dominant factor for the first, while on-site electron correlations are expected to play a role in the second. A few prototypes that may display an interplay of both long-range interactions and local electron correlations are also selected. Fundamental understanding of their properties lies at the heart of the proposed projects, which may be further grouped in four categories: · Excitations and ultrafast dynamics in single and bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides. · Excitations and ultrafast dynamics in a “traditional” corelated material (V2O3). · Further developments in techniques beyond density functional theory (DFT) to incorporate electron correlations. Some questions to address are: How do properties of bound and collective excitations depend on layer composition? What is the underlying mechanism for ultrafast charge-transfer and spin-flip processes? How do excited charges and spins relax after laser pulse perturbation? What is the role of phonons in ultrafast response? What is the influence of spin-orbit coupling on electronic properties of the 2D materials? What impact does electron-phonon interaction have on phase transitions? What is the effect of nonadiabaticity (memory) in electron-electron interactions on charge dynamics? The proposed project aims to answer these questions through reciprocal rationalization of experimental observations and validation of predictions from robust computational modeling. Ground-state properties of the material calculated with DFT will provide input for examination of bound excitations using the time dependent DFT code developed in the group, whose accuracy will be ascertained through newly developed long-range exchange correlation (XC) kernels and potentials. For Mott-like systems, DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+ DMFT (dynamical mean-field theory), will be applied as appropriate. For calculations of response to external probes, DMFT-TDDFT in which the XC kernel and potential are obtained from DMFT will be the basis for calculating charge/spin dynamics, absorption and emission spectra, and related quantities. Further inclusion of phonons and non-local interactions will allow examination of long-time (picosecond) response and effects of non-local Coulomb correlations which may be important for the materials in question. The intellectual merit of the proposed work is that state-of-the-art computational and theoretical approaches will be applied to address some fundamental questions about the role of long range-interaction and/or electron-correlations in selected systems – factors that also lie at the root of their technological applications. A fundamental understanding of the signatures of novel interactions in nanomaterials (and some not so well understood traditional materials) is essential for explaining experimental observations and predicting novel materials with desired functionalities and eventual technological applications. Of special significance is the focus on response to ultrafast probes, which has remained challenging because of the lack of accurate and efficient ab initio techniques. Ongoing collaborations with leading experimental groups will help address hitherto-debated conclusions of observed phenomena. They will also help validate and/or refine the computational methodology."

The unique qualities of neutrons, which “see” crystal structures, magnetic fluctuations and ordering, and lattice vibrations, are particularly well suited for their study. Changing the distances between atoms is well known to change the degree of atomic orbital overlap and thus the electronic and magnetic energy levels, and applying pressure is the best way to study how lattice size changes the properties of quantum materials since the degree of orbital overlap can be adjusted “cleanly” without the introduction of chemical disorder. To effectively take advantage of the combined qualities of neutron diffraction and high pressures, careful theoretical understanding must also be employed. This proposed research program applies neutron scattering, applied pressure, and theoretical analysis to determine the properties of quantum materials. The search for a comprehensive understanding of the complex electronic interactions in quantum materials under pressure, including the interplay of collective modes with quasi-particle dynamics and the discovery and characterization of new electronic materials is critical to the development of the field. This requires the establishment of new methods to expose quantum entanglement as well as the means to understand and control the effects of quenched disorder. Neutron scattering under applied pressure will play a critical role in establishing the understanding of these materials. The proposed studies of quantum materials under pressure, materials that display the coexistence of magnetism plus other physical phenomena such as a non-trivial electronic band topology, will have important implications for revealing previously unknown information about structure and magnetism, and will expand the number of properties and potential uses that such materials can have. The frontiers are to understand, design, and harness the wealth of novel emergent states that arise in quantum magnets under pressure. The goal of this project is to close a long-standing knowledge gap in quantum materials research by developing a high-pressure neutron scattering (HP-NS) toolbox to systematically determine the magnetic structures and electronic interactions present at high pressure. To attain this goal, we have designed and tested multiple high-pressure experimental approaches through the study of trigonal 122-type AMn2M2 (alkaline earth manganese pnictide) phases using neutron scattering. Building upon our preliminary studies, we propose to focus on: 1) quantifying the effect of pressure on magnetism and crystal structure; 2) validating the role of magnetism in stabilizing its coexistence with topological electronic states; 3) modeling magnetic interactions and spin dynamics by computational theory and 4) centrally, using high pressure to manipulate the interplay of multiple quantum phenomena both experimentally and theoretically. The proposed high-pressure neutron scattering studies will open new avenues for unraveling the effects of pressure on the interacting electrons that dominate the magnetic properties in various quantum materials. This project will form the foundation for the continuing investigation of a variety of spin-dominated quantum materials under extreme conditions, (especially high pressure). The establishment of structure-magnetism-electronic property relationships in forefront quantum materials is critical for understanding and predicting the properties of matter and energy at the atomic and molecular level, thus inspiring new strategies for materials discovery and characterization, and, over the long term, benefits the development of future energy technologies. This aligns with the priorities of the Neutron Scattering Program, also dovetails with BES’ mission."

Commercially available state-of-the art glow-like atmospheric plasma devices for industrial applications are either narrow tubes or wide slits with narrow openings. Often multiple sources are put together in various configurations to process larger surfaces. The traditional methods of exciting electrodes create spatially fixed electric fields. As a result, the space charge at atmospheric pressure tends to be spatially confined resulting in non-uniformity which eventually leads to instability as the discharge is scaled. We propose to investigate a new approach to create a relatively large and uniform glow-like atmospheric plasmas. The approach is to excite a set of electrodes in such a way that it produces a spatially traveling electric field which disperses the space charge. This study will lead to the creation of a scalable (volume and pressure) non-thermal plasma by controlling the space charge distribution to achieve a controllable large volume/ surface (10-20 cm diameter) dense plasma under ambient conditions. The proposed concept will be tested by building a device to control the space charge and conducting diagnostics to demonstrate its uniformity and the plasma densities achieved."

David Henry (Sandia National Lab), Eric Shaner (Sandia National Lab) Since early in the 20th century quantum mechanics has been recognized as the theory which best describes most physical phenomena. However, only recently has it become possible to directly control the interactions within small quantum systems, and to engineer them to perform useful functions. Great strides have been made in the operation of small-scale quantum information processors in recent years, though no technology has yet demonstrated a clear superiority. One important approach is to use very simple quantum systems as the fundamental building blocks &ndash; as the quantum bits, or qubits. We plan to develop a new technology utilizing individual electrons, a leading candidate for future quantum information processors, in which the qubit consists of the electron&rsquo;s magnetic moment (or spin). A key property of a qubit is its coherence time, which is roughly the time before quantum errors appear. Usually researchers study electron-spin qubits inside a semiconductor host, owing to their long coherence, fast quantum gates, and extremely compact devices. However, the electron spin coherence time becomes very short if the electrons are moved through the host semiconductor. While a quantum processor can be constructed without moving the qubits, mobile qubits can simplify the processor architecture and far fewer are required for the same complexity and speed. Mobile qubits may be particularly advantageous for near-term quantum simulators, where the additional flexibility will expand the range of a given processor. This new research program is aimed at exploring electron-spin qubits in a different materials system, in which electrons are bound to the surface of superfluid helium. There is indirect evidence that mobile electrons will have exceptionally long coherence in this system, along with the other advantages of spin qubits. However, there is neither a full theory of electron spin coherence for these electrons, nor direct experimental measurements of these spins. The key goals of this program are (1) to develop a theory of the details of the interaction between the electrons&rsquo; spins and the helium, and in particular how high perpendicular electric fields as might be found in future quantum devices will modify these interactions and affect the spin relaxation and decoherence rates; and (2) to develop experimental approaches for measuring ensemble electron spin coherence for these mobile qubits, and understand how control electrodes can be optimized for preserving the ultra-long spin coherence of the electrons while enabling the efficient control of their motion. Time permitting, this program will also work towards extending the experimental spin measurement and control to the single-electron level."

To uncover the enzymatic basis for the observed mechanism of extracellular electron uptake (EEU), this work will utilize a combination of shot-gun proteomic approaches that will allow us to identify the proteins expressed in M. barkeri under EEU conditions that are: 1) present in the extracellular space and 2) deferentially regulated under EEU vs. traditional methanogenic conditions. This work will also utilize mixed culture electrochemical techniques to better characterize the role of EEU (presently only characterized in pure cultures) in mixed cultures capable of direct interspecies electron transfer. One of the major goals of this work is to identify gene/proteins putatively involved in EEU, in order to help inform future genetic work that will investigate the role and/or function of these proteins. A methanogenic mechanism of EEU could prove foundational to novel microbe-electrode technologies and/or approaches for electrosynthesis of carbon-neutral methane biofuels."

This project focuses on fundamental studies of a unique class of metal-organic hybrid molecules, so-called endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs), in which quantum information can be encoded into the magnetic (spin) states associated with lanthanide (Ln) atoms that are encapsulated within robust carbon cages (fullerenes). This approach promises significant advantages over other current magnetic qubit targets based on inorganic molecules and solids. First and foremost, the fullerene cage provides a rigid environment devoid of elements that possess magnetic nuclei (the 12C nucleus is non-magnetic), thereby protecting the encapsulated atoms from well-known and stubborn noise sources &ndash; random vibrations and fluctuating magnetic fields due to nearby nuclei &ndash; that can easily erase fragile quantum information states. Equally important is the focus on carbon-based molecules, which opens up the vast toolbox of organic molecular chemistry. This will allow for large-scale synthesis of chemically identical species, with exquisite control over the quantum information states of the associated endohedral Ln atoms. Meanwhile, chemical functionalization of the periphery of the EMF cage will provide potential routes to scaling-up into more complex quantum circuits via molecular self-assembly, and possibilities for rapid optical encoding and read-out of quantum information via attachment of optically active organic groups. Finally, the quantum computational resources that are attainable within a single EMF molecule containing multiple Ln atoms (up to three) with large magnetic moments (e.g. Gd3+) are expected to be considerable in comparison to inorganic transition metal counterparts. Therefore, the project aims to demonstrate the implementation of simple quantum algorithms on individual Ln EMF qudits (the generalization to base d of a qubit), something that is not possible on a single molecular qubit. Synthetic efforts aim to: (1) realize accurate and targeted tuning of the magnetic quantum states of encapsulated Ln ions, thus enabling precise, high-fidelity qubit manipulation using advanced microwave magnetic resonance techniques; and (2) enable responsiveness to other external stimuli (light, current, etc.) for localized/selective qubit readout and control. The project will leverage unique electron spin resonance (ESR) instrumentation available at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), both for precisely characterizing the magnetic states of candidate Ln-EMF molecules, and for demonstrating practical quantum logic operations. Collectively, these efforts will lead to a seamless feedback loop encompassing structural design, chemical synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, and quantum operation, to establish fundamental understanding of the design rules for EMF-based molecular qubits/qudits with desired properties, paving the way towards next-generation quantum technologies."
Development of emerging model microorganisms: Megasphaera elsdenii for biomass and organic acid upgrading to fuels and chemicals,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019401,"Westpheling, Janet","Janet.Westpheling@theuniversityofgeorgiaresearchfoundation,inc.","['data', 'system', 'energy', 'process', 'model', 'approach', 'project', 'high']","The metabolic diversity of microorganisms in nature is largely an untapped source of important compounds that are difficult or impossible to engineer in the few model systems available. The native ability to condense acetyl-CoA groups to efficiently generate C4 to C8 compounds makes Megasphaera elsdenii a compelling platform for the production of fuels and chemicals from lactate and plant carbohydrates. Our overall objective is to develop Megasphaera elsdenii as a platform for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass sugars and organic acids into hexanol and other valuable chemicals. M. elsdenii produces organic acids as fermentation products when growing on lactate and glucose, including formation of butyric (four carbon), hexanoic (six carbon), and in some cases octanoic (eight carbon) acids as major fermentation products, likely via a chain elongation pathway using acetyl-CoA. As the carbon chain length increases for the corresponding alcohols, fuel properties improve, making hexanol an appealing target as a next-generation gasoline blend stock beyond ethanol. We propose that M. elsdenii could be engineered to efficiently produce next-generation, drop-in lignocellulosic fuels such as hexanol at high yield and titer if it could be developed as a bioengineering platform. While previous efforts to make products like alcohols in E. coli have been moderately successful, production of C6 and larger products remains low, suggesting that extending the chain elongation pathway beyond a single cycle remains a significant challenge in model organisms. Engineering M. elsdenii is an alternative approach with the potential for exceptionally high yields and titers of C6 products such as hexanol due to the natively high flux through this pathway. We recently developed a method for DNA transformation of two strains of Megasphaera elsdenii, opening this organism to advanced physiological studies and bioengineering. We will use existing and newly generated genome sequences to expand our existing central metabolic reconstruction into a genome scale model using the DOE KBase platform, which will be informed by transcriptomic analyses to better understand the physiology of M. elsdenii. We will also develop advanced genetic tools to enable more rapid and complex strain construction, and use this knowledge to develop strains capable of producing hexanol and related molecules at high yield and high titer from lignocellulosic sugars. Our initial target is converting lignocellulosic sugars to hexanol and related products; however, because M. elsdenii also ferments lactate to organic acids, this project will also lay the foundation for more advanced processing options such as a co-culture or sequential fermentation in which one organism converts sugars to lactate and an engineered M. elsdenii converts the lactate to a higher value product. This project is a collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory."
Opening New Frontiers of Near-Zero-Index (NZI) Optics: from Photonic Time Crystals to Non-Reciprocity and Novel Localization Regimes,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0017717,"Boltasseva, Alexandra",Alexandra.Boltasseva@purdueuniversity,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","Opening New Frontiers of Near-Zero-Index (NZI) Optics: from Photonic Time Crystals to Non-Reciprocity and Novel Localization Regimes PI: Alexandra Boltasseva, co-PIs: Zubin Jacob, Vladimir M. Shalaev, Purdue University Opportunity:The recent rise of novel material platforms – both naturally occurring and artificially structured – with tailorable, exotic optical response, is continuing to transform the very fundamentals of the Science of Light as well as photonic applications including communication, imaging, sensing, energy and emerging quantum information technologies. The current progress in the areas of engineered materials such as photonic crystals, metamaterials, flat optics with metasurfaces and photonic topological insulators, is accelerated by the introduction of new, previously unexplored constituent materials with unusual optical response, low optical loss and unparalleled tailorability that can be obtained in two-dimensional materials, complex oxides, doped semiconductors, Weyl semimetals and plasmonic ceramics. Most interestingly, the recent emergence of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) has enabled exploration of a new field of optics with very low – near-zero – refractive index (NZI). In addition to remarkable new physics, including photon tunneling, super-coupling and many more, such NZI optics enables extreme nonlinear interactions and ultrafast switchability that overcomes the usual trade-off of the fast vs large amplitude modulation. Such unmatched tunability of the optical properties is expected to unlock new, time-varying physics and enable novel switchable photonic concepts. Also, NZIs can promote unique regimes of strong light localization due to the fact that the refractive index and therefore the light wavevector k tend to zero thus opening up new exploration vistas for disordered NZI media. Challenge:While several artificially engineered NZI media have been proposed utilizing plasmonic nanowires, metal-dielectric superlattices and nanoscale waveguides, their inherent length scale sets the limit to observation of many exotic NZI effects. Here, TCOs and other emerging materials can uniquely provide the NZI operational regime in homogenous media thus enabling the exploration of advanced optical concepts such as time-varying photonics including photonic-time crystals, novel regimes of light localization, and NZI-enhanced topological and parity-time (PT) symmetric photonic systems. Approach:Building on our results achieved in the previously funded effort, we will push frontiers of NZI optics and study fundamentally new light-matter interaction regimes. By utilizing TCOs, transition metal nitrides other complex oxides and semiconductors as NZI platforms, we will aim at: (i) realizing photonic time-crystals (PTCs) and exploring new PTC phenomena (Thrust I); (ii) conducting the foundational studies of disorder and localization effects as well as non-reciprocity in the NZI regime (Thrust II); and (iii) demonstrating ultrafast control over parity-time (PT) symmetry states in NZI media (Thrust III). Building upon the team’s prior achievements, we will leverage on both the material optimization and the developed fabrication and optical characterization schemes. We will use our most recent results on all-optical switching and time-varying response in TCOs as the foundation for the proposed new studies. Intellectual Merit:The proposed NZI optics exploration is expected to impact both the fundamental science of light and photonic technologies that are well aligned with the mission of DOE to study the fundamental physical properties of materials and to provide the foundations for new technologies including energy, environment, and national security. The NZI phenomena could transform the research fields of nonlinear optics, photonic crystals, optical metamaterials and quantum photonic devices; and offer alternative routes to realize efficient lasers, enhanced sensitivity sensors and advanced light modulators. Broader Impacts:We anticipate that this effort will result in seminal contributions to the fundamental science of light and impact research and education at the intersection of optics, materials engineering, and quantum physics, as well as provide a unique interdisciplinary training platform the next generation of optical researchers. The team will also aim at extending the existing collaborations and build new ones with DoE laboratories on the topics related to the proposed NZI studies."
Geophysics of Fracture Intersections in 3D Networks,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0001048,"Pyrak-Nolte, Laura",Laura.Pyrak-Nolte@purdueuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","The role of fracture intersections in the evolution of fracture network connectivity has been largely overlooked, and yet without intersections, fractures would be isolated in space. Although such intersections compose only a tiny fraction of the total void volume of a fracture network in rock, closure or sealing of an intersection can radically affect the geometry of the transport paths though a system. Fracture network connectivity controls access to the fracture surfaces which are the interfaces between rock and the natural or engineered fluids that are injected, extracted or sequestered in subsurface rock. The behavior of intersections is central to how a fracture network evolves in response to changing physical and geochemical processes. This importance of intersections is well recognized, but little is understood about their physical properties, raising key questions: How do intersections deform under stress? How do they scatter elastic wave energy? How do they control geochemical reactions in a 3D fracture network? The challenge to achieving a fundamental understanding of the behavior of fracture networks arises because natural or induced fracture networks possess a wide range of topological elements that govern the geometry and connectivity within the networks, and the orientation of the network elements relative to external stress-fields affects their deformation and their changing contribution to network connectivity. In our proposed work, we will perform a fundamental study of the simplest fracture network topological elements that control fracture network properties when subjected to external fields in laboratory experiments. Our research objectives are: (i) to investigate how fracture intersections deform under stress and affect the flow paths through a network; (ii) to determine how complex network geometry affects gravity-driven flow and mineral precipitation distributions; and (iii) to determine how fracture intersections contribute to energy partitioning of elastic waves. Achievement of these objectives will provide insight into the roles that network topology and geometry play in determining geophysical signatures of fracture networks. Our approach will utilize several key resources. These are: (1) fabrication of synthetic 3D fractured systems with designed geometries to enable the repeatable study of fracture intersection and fracture network deformation; (2) 3D X-ray microscopy with volumetric digital image correlation (VDIC) using an in-situ stress rig to image and quantify the deformation of all components of a fracture network under stress; and (3) acoustically emitting chattering dust to track streamlines through networks in response to hydraulic and mechanical perturbations, and to probe the properties of fractures and intersections in a network. The research proposed here lays the groundwork for advancing our understanding of fracture network connectivity and of how it changes in response to physical and chemical process. Successful completion of the proposed work will advance the goal of characterization and adaptive control of subsurface fracture networks."

This is one of the hard problems of condensed matter physics, and has attracted much attention in the past. The PI has formulated the Extremely Correlated Fermi Liquid theory recently for this purpose. The theory overcomes difficulties in the Feynman diagram based techniques, and uses functional differential equations of Schwinger-Tomonaga genre. These are expanded iteratively to set up successive schemes for practical evaluation. An initial low order iterative scheme has been implemented recently. The resulting spectral-functions and self-energies have been benchmarked successfully in non trivial model systems, where exact results at strong coupling are available from specialized alternate methods. These include the numerically exact Wilson&rsquo;s renormalization group solution of the Anderson impurity model. Comparisons have also been made with the U=&infin; Hubbard model, in d=&infin; with the dynamical mean field theory, and in d=1 with the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization-group. These favorable benchmarking results strongly encourage further development of the new methodology. The calculated physical variables are also amenable to experimental checks, using angle resolved photoemission, thermodynamics, transport, magneto-transport, scanning tunneling measurements, optical conductivity, Raman spectroscopy and magnetic resonance. Calculations for these variables using the initial scheme have been reported recently, for hole-doping beyond the optimal value. The results are encouragingly close to data. The results give crucial and often unique insights into the temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall angle, and also electronic spectral-functions. The theory also has clearcut and stimulating predictions for further experiments. This proposal outlines several projects relating to the refinement and extension of the methodology, and subsequent applications. A study of the under-doped regime of the cuprates is of experimental interest, this requires considerable technical extensions of current theory. The related developments proposed here include the description of broken magnetic and translation symmetric states, as well as superconducting states of the t-J model. The proposed developments include extending the models to include long ranged Coulomb interaction, and a numerically intensive approach for evaluating higher order iterations of the equations arising in the theory. The project includes the development of new models for describing novel correlated systems such as twisted bilayer graphene. An example is that of establishing and developing an analogy with known Mott-Hubbard systems, such as the 2-dimensional system strontium-copper-borate SrCu2(BO3)2. The studies described in this proposal would help in firmly establishing a controlled theory of strong correlations."

The precise, atomic-level description of catalytic reactions, as well as the search for optimal catalyst among the immense number of possible materials, requires a synergistic effort between theory and experiment. State-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations, in combination with microkinetic modeling and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, enable the robust modeling of reaction kinetics under realistic reaction conditions. Experimentally, reactivity data are obtained from reaction kinetics measurements. The comparison between theory and experiment facilitates the validation and refinement of the theoretical models, aiding the elucidation of the reaction mechanism and the nature of the catalytically active site. By extending such studies across a wide range of catalytic systems, reactivity trends are established, and key activity and selectivity descriptors are identified, which can be used to guide the rational design of optimal catalysts with the right structure and composition. The realization of the theory-predicted catalytic materials is accomplished through experimental efforts using advanced inorganic synthesis techniques, through which the catalyst size (from large nanoparticles of ~10 nm in size to single metal atoms dispersed on support materials), shape (e.g., cube, octahedra, icosahedra), and elemental composition can be precisely controlled. To determine whether the design targets are fulfilled, the synthesized catalyst materials are characterized and evaluated using a variety of experimental characterization methods, both ex situ and in situ. This way, a positive feedback loop is established between theory and experiment. The outcome of this research should offer unprecedented insights into the evolution of catalyst structure under realistic reaction conditions. Further, it should guide the synthesis of novel metal-support complexes with improved catalytic properties for practical applications in thermal catalysis and electrocatalysis, such as CO oxidation, oxygen reduction reaction, and CO2 electroreduction. Ultimately, rational catalyst design at the nanoscale will be advanced using this combined theoretical and experimental approach. The utility of this approach has already been demonstrated in the past grant period, particular in the following areas: i) fundamental mechanistic studies for formic acid (FA) decomposition and methanol self-coupling on sub-nanometric transition-metal clusters or SACs, as well as for isotope effects in H2 dissociative adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, ii) fundamental aspects of electrocatalysis, such as FA electrooxidation on metal and alloy catalysts, and iii) development of novel methods for both experimental synthesis of shape-selected metal and alloy nanoparticles and theoretical modeling of reaction kinetics."

These compounds have a range of fascinating properties that emerge as the structure of these materials is controlled via the formation of nanoscale patterns and probed at times similar to the natural timescales of fundamental processes. This project is developing x-ray scattering methods and applying them to challenging scientific problems in the materials science and materials physics of ferroic complex oxide electronic materials. The x-ray methods include nanobeam magnetic diffraction techniques and ultrafast x-ray scattering methods for studying the structural evolution and dynamics of oxide thin films. The complementary use of ultrafast and nanobeam-related techniques allows these problems to be addressed in ways that would not otherwise be possible. The research directions benefit from recent developments in the capabilities of x-ray sources, particularly through the dramatic recent improvement in the emittance of electron-storage-ring based synchrotron light sources. The project probes three related problems in the structure and dynamics of nanoscale order in ferroic materials: (1) Characterization of nanoscale structural and magnetic coupling in magnetic insulators. TX-ray nanobeam magnetic diffraction and nanobeam imaging methods are being used to probe the nanoscale magnetism of thin-film magnetic insulators. X-ray magnetic diffraction techniques provide precise local magnetic information from materials and devices with nanoscale dimensions, a regime in which combined structural and magnetic information has not been previously available (2) Understanding and controlling the dynamics of structural features associated with nanoscale ferroelectricity: Recent developments in materials design and epitaxial synthesis techniques have made it possible to create systematic variations in the orientation of oxygen octahedra with perovskite oxide thin films. Control of the octahedral orientation promises to yield a new approach to the control of functional properties such as ferroelectricity and magnetism, but systematic exploration faces artifacts due to subtle variations among substrates with different strain and symmetry. Ultrafast time-resolved diffraction techniques are being used to probe the rotation of octahedra as a function of ultrafast optically induced distortion in BiFeO3, a model perovskite for which octahedral rotation predictions are already available. The resulting structural probe promises to be widely applied to problems associated with octahedra in thin films and at interfaces, including in improper ferroelectricity in superlattices. (3) Dispersion of magnetic excitations in magnetic garnets: The magnetic excitations of thin-film magnetic materials are being using a novel combination of the developments in x-ray magnetic diffraction and ultrafast methods described in the previous two activities. Previous work has shown that the acoustic phonon dispersion can be accurately measured using high-dynamic range thin-film diffraction techniques. Ultrafast scattering is being combined with magnetic diffraction in order to measure the dispersion of spin waves in magnetic garnets. The dispersion and lifetimes of these excitations are key components underpinning models of spintronic devices based on the spin-Seebeck effect but are presently out of reach for optical probes and inelastic x-ray or neutron scattering techniques."
TES: Modelling Microbes to Predict Post-Fire Carbon Cycling in the Boreal Forest across Burn Severities,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0021022,"Whitman, Thea","Thea.Whitman@boardofregentsoftheuniversityofwisconsinsystem,operatingasuniversityofwisconsin-madison","['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Boreal forests hold between 370-1720 Pg carbon (C) above- and belowground, making them a major stock of C globally. In North American boreal ecosystems, wildfire is the primary stand-replacing disturbance, and fires are projected to increase in frequency and severity in the future. Fires have direct effects on C stocks due to immediate losses during combustion, but also have indirect effects, through the modification of soil properties and remaining soil C, the response of vegetation communities, and changes to soil microbial communities and their activities. Changes to fire frequency and severity could affect each of these processes, and changes to fire severity or frequency have, indeed, been associated with changes in soil C storage. However, data quantifying these effects are sparse, and our understanding of the mechanisms driving them remains limited. Recent advances in Earth system model (ESM) representations of soil C cycling, such as the Carbon, Organisms, Rhizosphere and Protection in the Soil Environment (CORPSE) model, have included an emphasis on explicitly representing the system in an increasingly mechanistically accurate way. In particular, this has included: representing both physically protected and unprotected C; distinguishing between rhizosphere and bulk soil; representing microbes as dead or living, or as different functional types, among other developments. Because of their mechanistic nature, these models may be better prepared to represent the effects of wildfires on soil C dynamics than most current ESMs. Standard ESMs generally do not represent complex feedbacks between fire, vegetation, soils, microbes, and climate. Rather, they usually represent fires only in terms of their frequency and impacts on vegetation biomass pools, and predict that the above-ground community follows a well- known trajectory over time, with no new steady states other than those functionally similar to the previous state. We propose to determine whether linking belowground microbial community composition, size, and activity to aboveground properties of burn severity and plant community composition (upland jack pine and upland spruce) allows us to better model post-fire soil CO2 fluxes using the CORPSE model. We will use an integrated modelling-experimental approach, with mechanistic laboratory experiments designed to inform models of three hierarchical levels of complexity. Our objectives are as follows: Objective 1. Quantify changes in C fluxes, microbial biomass, and microbial community composition, after simulated fires in intact soil cores across a burn severity gradient. Objective 2. Develop and evaluate adaptations to the CORPSE model to better represent post-fire SOC dynamics across a burn severity gradient using data from Objective 1 across a hierarchy of model complexity: (1) no explicit microbial representation; (2) community-level microbial traits characterized by single scalable parameters – maximum growth rate, CUE, and total microbial biomass; (3) microbes characterized as an assemblage of multiple functional groups with different traits constrained by the observed experimental data across the microbial community. Objective 3. Test the capacity of the adapted CORPSE model (Objective 2) to predict CO2 flux rates in burned cores from new sites. Wildfires in boreal ecosystems represent a globally significant ecological process that is expected to be sensitive to climate change, but is currently insufficiently understood and represented in models. We propose fundamental, mechanism-based and model-driven research in a globally important system with basic relevance for environmental change, addressing current modelling challenges. It will help advance understanding of Earth’s biogeochemical systems and climate while developing insights into terrestrial cycling of C and nutrients, and their feedbacks with Earth’s climate system, thus strengthening scientific knowledge in ecology, biology, and biogeochemistry."

In consequence, whatever shapes soil microbial activity shapes the world. Substantial recent work in environmental microbiology has taught us that viruses are a key driver of microbial ecology in other systems, and we expect the same to hold true in soil. But soil is a complex milieu &ndash; highly structured, chemically and physically heterogenous, and resistant to extrapolation. Thus, even as new methods have revolutionized our understanding of microbial and viral ecology in other systems, our understanding of soil microbial ecology has lagged, and our understanding of soil viral ecology is still further behind. Our objective is to develop paradigms for understanding the role of viruses in soil ecology, and to build the tools &ndash; scalable new methods, new databases, and new model systems &ndash; to test the validity of these paradigms. In developing paradigms for soil viral ecology, we will focus intensively on one system, a permafrost thaw gradient at Stordalen Mire that has been the focus of the DOE-funded IsoGenie Consortium for nearly a decade. Despite the rich ecological picture emerging from IsoGenie&rsquo;s work, the technical challenges in developing soil viral methods have left Stordalen&rsquo;s viruses virtually unstudied. Recent advances by PI Sullivan within IsoGenie have laid the groundwork for this new proposal to broadly and transformatively impact soil viral ecology. In Aim 1, we seek to leverage existing IsoGenie datasets and soil samples to (i) apply and improve the analytics and machine-learning methods we established for viral ecogenomics in soils, (ii) track carbon transformations and microbial host dynamics over the course of viral incubations, and (iii) use microscopy to ask the fundamental question of what the baseline rate of viral infection is and how it varies across environmental gradients. Aim 2 seeks to broadly optimize viral ecogenomic tools for use in soils, including developing several new critically-needed methods advances that do not yet exist for any environment. First, we will improve capture of DNA and RNA viruses in soils. Through our VirION method for low-input long-read sequencing we will improve recovery of intact dsDNA viral genomes, while improved analytics and physical particle capture methods will allow us to better detect RNA viral sequences in IsoGenie bulk soil metagenomes and give us access to a particularly understudied region of the viral world. Second, several methods will be adapted to establish high-throughput virus-host linkages &ndash; critically needed with the pace of new viral discovery vastly outpacing characterization and classification. Third, we will establish biochemistry-informed informatics to identify mobile genetic elements in the soil virome, which likely drastically impact the soil microbiome and geochemistry but remain virtually unknown. Fourth, we will develop and deploy scalable forward genetics methods to establish a large-scale understanding of phage resistance in a model system, and apply CRISPR-Cas9 engineering to test resultant hypotheses from these genome-wide screens and assess phage components of the virus-host arms race. Finally, this aim seeks to establish baseline paradigms in our understanding of viral infection dynamics and the resultant biogeochemical impacts via metabolite profiling using novel instrumentation and analytics. Aim 3 seeks to provide foundational resources that will broadly help soil viral and microbial ecologists seeking to use systems biology approaches in these complex systems. First, hundreds of microbial strains isolated from a range of soils will be screened to isolate viruses to provide approximately 15 new genome-sequenced and host-range-characterized virus-host model systems for future study. Second, we will build a centralized and curated online resource for viral genomics, proteomics, and taxonomy, and we will hold a workshop to train our colleagues in the methods we have developed. Together, the work proposed will transform soil viral ecology as a field, and with it our understanding of viruses and the soil microbiome as drivers of global biogeochemistry."

Our long-term vision is to solve key science challenges in photo-electro-chemical conversion systems by means of computation and simulation, to contribute to the design of systems with superior performance. The challenges are in light absorption and charge carrier generation, charge carrier transport, and charge carrier reactivity. The present project has two thrusts: one deals with modeling of the transport of photo-generated electron and hole charge carriers in complex crystalline materials for solar energy conversion, combining first principles atomistic and mesoscale simulations. The combined modeling is indispensable for qualitative and quantitative understanding of how carrier transport affects conversion efficiency. We aim to establish a theoretical foundation for facet selectivity and homo-junctions, two emerging strategies toward enhanced charge separation and conversion performance. A second thrust deals with the characterization of interfacial redox chemistry in tailored oxygen-deficient interfaces for enhanced activity.

The proposed solution is to integrate a novel containerless sample environment and an event-based data acquisition system with a high flux neutron beamline and non-contact measurements of density, viscosity and surface tension of liquids. The use of laser beam heating allows rapid heating (100 K/s) and cooling to access metastable states that cannot be obtained using a conventional furnace. The R&D will: (i) fully commission the alpha prototype into the user program, (ii) develop and construct a beta prototype instrument, (iii) integrate simultaneous measurements of atomic structure and thermophysical properties, and (iv) establish commercial presence for the instrument, launch product and initiate sales. The product of this R&D will be a beamline facility and a research instrument that will be marketed by direct interaction with customers. The proposed system has direct applications in neutron facilities such as SNS, HFIR, ESS, ISIS and other sources. The approach is also suitable for marketing to X-ray facilities where there are additional markets for instruments based on the proposed technology. Combined structure/property measurements respond to a market need in industrial and university materials research. Prior sales of extreme environment instruments has been several M$."
Electron-optical Column for a 4 MeV Ultrafast Electron Microscope,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0017046,"Mankos, Marian",Marian.Mankos@electronoptica,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Electron-Optical column for a 4 MeV Ultrafast Electron Microscope—Electron Optica, 2331 Tasso Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301-4140 Marian Mankos, Principal Investigator, marian@electronoptica.com Marian Mankos, Business Official, marian@electronoptica.com Amount: $999,780.00 Many atomic processes occur on timescales that are as short as tens of femtoseconds. While pulsed lasers have the temporal resolution to investigate these processes, they cannot provide the requisite spatial resolution. Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) and Dynamic transmission electron microscopy (DTEM) are pulsed electron techniques that have been recently developed to examine the dynamics of these processes with adequate spatial resolution. Unfortunately, Coulomb interactions among the electrons broadens the temporal and spatial extent of the pulse. The Coulomb interactions mainly increase the beam energy spread (Boersch effect) from a fraction of an electron-Volt to hundreds or even thousands of electron-Volts. The Boersch effect has a two-fold impact on the electron optics: it spreads the arrival time window of the pulse from tens of femtoseconds to picoseconds and beyond; and it increases the objective lens chromatic aberration, which reduces the spatial resolution. Consequently, there remains a strong demand for improving the temporal resolution of the probing pulse without sacrificing total pulse charge and spatial resolution. In this SBIR project, EOI is developing a UEM column with atomic resolution, on the order of 3 Å, and capable of reducing the electron pulse length into the sub-nanosecond range for single shot applications with up to 10 million electrons/pulse and into the deep femtosecond range for stroboscopic applications with thousands of electrons/pulse. The key feature of this approach is the combination of a high energy electron gun, such as a superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) photocathode gun, and a novel electron column operating at up to 4 MeV. This approach has two major advantages compared to existing UEM designs: first, the acceleration to relativistic energies dramatically lowers the Coulomb effects due to electron-electron interactions, which allows the use of significantly more electrons/pulse; and second, it pro- vides high temporal resolution that is accompanied by atomic scale resolution owing to a lens system with low aberrations. The column comprises three distinct components: the illumination arm, the objective lens, and the projection arm. In the initial Phase II, EOI produced a detailed mechano-optical design of the illumination arm and the objective lens and is currently assembling the prototype. EOI plans to complete the prototype by the end of the initial phase II and ready it for integration with a high energy RF gun. In the sequential Phase IIA, EOI aims to complete the UEM column by designing, building and integrating the projection optics. EOI plans to assemble and test the UEM column, integrate it with the electron gun at a DOE facility and verify experimentally the performance of the instrument in diffraction and imaging modes. EOI’s novel UEM column provides a path to a product targeted for emerging ultrafast applications, thus making it suitable for enhancing the study of the structure, composition, and bonding states of new materials at ultrafast time scales to advance material science research in the field of nanotechnology and in particular in biomedical research."
Biogeochemical consequences of microbial evolution under drought,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020382,"Allison, Steven","Steven.Allison@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,irvine","['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","This project aims to understand and predict how evolution in microbiomes affects carbon and nutrient cycling under environmental change. The following overarching question are addressed: How does evolutionary adaptation influence microbiome functioning in response to drought? The main hypothesis is that evolutionary change results in a significant shift in microbiome genetic composition and functioning under drought conditions. To assess microbiome responses to drought, cutting-edge genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic methods will be combined with novel, field-based manipulations of microbiomes. Resulting data will be incorporated into new mathematical models of biogeochemical cycling. Due to changing global precipitation patterns, many ecosystems will experience more frequent and intense drought. It is known that microbiomes respond to drought through changes in genetic composition, and that these shifts have consequences for carbon and nutrient cycling. However, it is unknown to what degree evolutionary processes contribute to changes in genetic composition and biogeochemical functioning when microbiomes respond to drought. To address this gap, microbial evolution in the field under drought and ambient conditions will be evaluated. This will involve the application of &lsquo;omics approaches to quantify physiological, evolutionary, and demographic responses to drought and consequences for microbiome functioning. The project consists of three main activities. The first activity will use genomic approaches and physiological assays to measure how much evolutionary processes, community shifts, and dispersal contribute to drought responses of microbiomes. Field experiments and laboratory assays will test drought responses of individual microbial populations as well as whole communities. The second activity will use a suite of -omics approaches, genetic manipulations, and advanced spectroscopy to determine the consequences of evolutionary and community responses for ecosystem benefits like carbon and nutrient cycling. It is expected that selection for improved microbiome performance under drought conditions will affect these benefits due to tradeoffs between drought tolerance and other aspects of microbial physiology. The third activity will incorporate findings into a predictive model. Current models of carbon and nutrient cycling omit evolution, thus results will be used to develop a new generation of microbial models that account for changes in microbiomes due to evolution. Measurements of tradeoffs between drought tolerance and other microbial characteristics will also improve predictions of carbon and nutrient cycling driven by evolution in microbiomes. This project will determine how evolution in microbiomes influences rates of carbon and nutrient cycling, a topic that is not well understood scientifically. Although the work will focus on drought responses, the resulting conceptual advances can be applied to other problems that affect microbiomes, such as extreme weather events or nutrient pollution. By combining advanced molecular techniques with physiological assays, connections among microbial genotypes and phenotypes that are evolving in response to environmental change will be established. Finally, a computer model that incorporates -omics data and knowledge advances in microbial evolution to generate better predictions of ecosystem benefits under shifting environmental conditions will be established."

Particle Identification (PID) subsystems, often operating in magnetic fields >1.5 Tesla, require highly segmented (2-3 mm pixel) photodetectors with high gain, low intrinsic background, and high photocathode efficiency to support the high rates found in noisy radiation environments. Large Area Picosecond Photo Detectors (LAPPD™) currently being commercialized by Incom, Inc. has demonstrated many of the needed requirements, however, there is still much development and optimization needed for LAPPD™ to be a candidate for these applications. Development and demonstration of a pixelated readout is essential for Electron Ion Collider (EIC) R&D efforts and can potentially provide an upgrade option for current Nuclear Physics PID subsystems. The development of the High Rate Picosecond Photon Detector (HRPPD) was initiated by Incom Inc. under DOE NP Phase I SBIR project (award DE-SC0020578) to fulfill specific requirements on photosensors to have a pixelated readout with 3 mm x 3 mm pixel size and perform at high rates (200 kHz/cm2) in a 2-3 Tesla magnetic field as exemplified by the EIC collaboration, and other NP programs. Realization of these features in 20 cm x 20 cm form factor LAPPD™ currently being commercialized by Incom Inc. is rather challenging although LAPPD has already demonstrated picosecond timing, high gain, low noise and high Quantum Efficiency (QE). In order to meet these needs, a new direct readout anode was demonstrated in Phase I to offer improved signal to noise compared to alternative approaches. Because of the complexity the technical development for this novel anode, it was decided to prototype it initially using a smaller 10 cm x 10 cm form before scaling up to full size (20 cm X 20 cm) LAPPD size. Over the course of Phase I project we have demonstrated feasibility of directly coupled 3 mm x 3 mm anode readout; developed 10 cm x 10 cm ALD functionalized MCPs with 10-micron pores for better timing and magnetic field tolerance and tested a fully functional open face High Rate Picosecond Photo Detector (HRPPD) package. The main objective of this Phase II project will be to demonstrate fully functional sealed HRPPD suitable for pilot production, test and evaluate prototype HRPPD in practical beamline trials. This will be realized in the following steps. Performing multiple sealing trials with HRPPD packages. Based on our experience with sealing 20 cm x 20 cm LAPPDs, multiple iterations of 10 cm x 10 cm detector packages will used to find an optimal sidewall geometry and metallization. Sealing HRPPD sidewalls to an entry window will be used to evaluate the designs with a goal of 80% sealing yield. Development of a reliable production process for large area 10-micron pore MCPs. As mentioned above under Phase I project, 108 mm x 108 mm 10-micron ALD-GCA-MCPs have been produced. However, the production yield for these GCA-ALD-MCPs was rather low due to the need to refine the production of large format 10-micron pore. In this Phase II we will increase yields and quality of larger format 10-micron pore MCPs by improving GCA fusing process and optimizing ALD process. Performing sealing trials with a complete MCP stack. Several sealing trials with a complete detector package will be initiated in a dedicated Integration and Sealing Tank. These fully functioning detectors will have a standard bi-alkali photocathode, a pair of 10-micron pore ALD-GCA-MCPs, and a pixelated or capacitively coupled readout. Characterization of HRPPD. In order to characterize the HRPPD, a dedicated readout board will be designed. Quantum Efficiency, gain, timing and spatial resolution, and the high-rate capability of HRPPD will be measured in a dedicated setup. Magnetic Field Tolerance HRPPD performance at high magnetic fields (up to 3T) will be evaluated. LAPPD™ and the HRPPD will enable new techniques in HEP, homeland security (non-proliferation) sensors to screen vehicles and cargo for Special Nuclear Materials (SNMs) and scientific detectors for astrophysics, time-of-flight mass spectrometry and medical imaging products including detectors for positron emission tomography (PET scanning) that are not accessible with conventional small area MCP-PMTs."

Manipulating chemical production through breeding and metabolic bioengineering is a critical strategy to develop crops with higher productivity, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and with optimum design for the biorefinery. To rationally design such crops, we must better understand how natural products are synthesized, expand the catalog of identified plant-derived chemicals, and validate the functions and identities of the genes and enzymes required to synthesize metabolites. There are hundreds of thousands of plant metabolites and individual species are capable of producing greater than 5000 different compounds, yet, only a small percentage are structurally identified. Recent advances permit untargeted metabolomics, experiments in which the presence and abundance of many metabolites can be measured in parallel. These experiments are typically insufficient for unambiguous compound identification and as a result, most metabolites are annotated as &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; in these experiments. Thus, despite recent technical leaps in scientific instrumentation, our current knowledge base does not yet permit a rational design of crops, in large part because we do not know the functions of most genes in plant genomes nor the identities of most plant metabolites. To meet the challenges associated with identifying metabolites and annotating genes within plant metabolic pathways, we have developed a robust approach comprising isotopic labeling, mass spectrometry, and genome wide association (GWA). Whole genome sequencing has identified millions of naturally occurring DNA sequence differences in populations of many plant species. As a result, it is now possible to test all of these sequence changes for association with variation in traits, including metabolite accumulation. We propose that coupling GWA and parallel measurements of metabolites isotopically tagged by pathways-of-origin can uncover novel metabolism and unlock our understanding of multiple metabolic pathways. Most importantly, it is a high-throughput method for generating experimental evidence to enable accurate determination of gene function. As a proof of concept, we identified compounds derived from the amino acid phenylalanine in Arabidopsis, and genes associated with their production. We will now adapt the experimental approach and bioinformatics pipeline to identify all metabolites derived from precursors for which isotopically labeled precursors are available, in a crop and bioenergy species where the applied value of this approach can be realized. In this project, we will apply our labeling pipeline to Arabidopsis and sorghum by feeding tissues with isotopically labeled versions of commercially available amino acids to identify all metabolite features that incorporate the label. This will identify the precursor-of-origin for thousands of unknown metabolites. We will then use GWA to map genes responsible for the synthesis of these metabolites. We will perform untargeted metabolomics on leaf and root tissues from 300 diverse sorghum inbred lines. We will focus on metabolites corresponding to amino acid precursor-of-origin metabolites in our library to identify novel gene-metabolite associations. Finally, we will utilize mutants of sorghum to validate these gene-metabolite relationships. In parallel, we will conduct similar experiments using our pre-existing Arabidopsis metabolite GWA dataset to identify genes required for the synthesis of labeled metabolites with a known pathway-of-origin. This will provide an independent test of gene annotation and pathway involvement, via GWA gene-metabolite associations and by analyzing gene knockouts in Arabidopsis. Genes of particular interest from both sorghum and Arabidopsis will be studied in detail by directly measuring activity of the corresponding enzymes following heterologous expression. In summary, this work will classify as-yet-unknown amino acid-derived metabolites and identify genes involved in their production generated through &ldquo;omics&rdquo; technologies. This information will be used to validate gene function and identify new metabolism in Arabidopsis and sorghum."

While significant progress has been made in addressing the electronic structures of these and other actinide elements from both theoretical and spectroscopic perspectives, definitive, predictive models remain elusive because of the limitations of theory in addressing extended body actinide systems with multi-reference methods, intrinsic difficulties in measuring the properties of molecules containing these elements, and complex spectroscopic and physical properties arising from multiple electronic phenomena. The principal goal of these molecular synthetic and X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies is to disentangle the complex electronic structure of actinide materials. Truncating extended solids to spectroscopically and computationally addressable molecular systems can greatly simplify the development of detailed structure function relationships in actinide materials and complexes. This research program pairs synthetic molecular actinide (Th, U, Np, and Pu) studies with synchrotron spectroscopies and physical property studies to break down the challenge of understanding the electronic structure of f-element systems. These studies will extend established ligand classes from the lanthanides and early actinides to plutonium complexes in order to gain key spectroscopic information about the electronic structure of plutonium materials.

Predictive Integrated Modeling of Tokamak Plasmas,Office of Fusion Energy Sciences,DE-SC0013977,"Rafiq, Tariq",Tariq.Rafiq@lehighuniversity,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Predictive Integrated Modeling of Tokamak Plasmas Dr. Tariq Rafiq, Lehigh University The purpose of the fusion experiments is to contain a sufficiently dense plasma at a sufficiently high temperature for a sufficiently long time to make the fusion power practical. The fundamental issue is the short confinement time due to the multiple plasma losses associated with the transport of energy and particles through the confining magnetic field of tokamak plasmas. Transport refers to the flow of heat, momentum or particles across the plasma. Neoclassical transport is caused by charged particle collisions and drifts, but not by turbulence. Anomalous transport refers to transport over and above neoclassical transport. There is compelling evidence that most of the transport in tokamaks is driven by turbulence. Turbulence is normally simulated by following the motion of billions of individual marker particles or, equivalently, by following the evolution of the particle distribution functions in five-dimensional phase space. These ``gyro-kinetic'' simulations are normally run for a few tens of microseconds of plasma time, in tens to hundreds of hours’ computer simulation (wall-clock) time, before the turbulence settles down to a quasi-steady state. It is therefore not practical to compute transport directly from gyro-kinetic codes during each step of an integrated modeling simulation for the entire duration of a tokamak discharge, which is tens to hundreds of seconds. Simulation on a discharge time scale requires the development of physics-based reduced modules that can be used for predictive simulations and run for a tokamak discharge time to describe anomalous transport driven by turbulence. There is currently an ongoing effort to use this strategy to develop and improve the transport models. Integrated modeling simulations generally consider only the core plasma from the top of the pedestal into the magnetic axis. Since the core and edge temperature profiles are tightly coupled in tokamak discharges it is essential to include models governing both the core and edge temperature profiles within predictive integrated simulations. The theory based multi-species multi-fluid multi-mode anomalous transport module (MMM) will be used in integrating modeling code TRANSP to carry out self-consistent core-edge predictive time dependent transport simulations in order to compute the temperature, density, current, rotation, and other profiles that are measured in existing experiments and, then, to extrapolate to future planned devices. The missing physics in the components of MMM such as isotope, shaping, and impurity effects will be included using a unified fluid/kinetic approach and use gyrokinetic turbulence simulations to test transport models and to validate them using experimental data. Tokamaks have isotopic mass dependency in a variety of confinement characteristics. The effects of isotope mass on transport in tokamak discharges will be investigated in order to understand the interplay between atomic physics processes and thermal, momentum, and particle transport from the separatrix to the magnetic axis. This research will identify the isotope effects on plasma transport and will also gain a deeper understanding of the isotope effects on heating, current drive, H-mode pedestal, and energy confinement time. The impurities that may be present in D-T fusion reaction fuel, including helium formed from D-T fusion reactions, and material emitted from the first wall, have the capability of diluting fusion reaction fuel concentration as well as radiating power from the plasma, thereby decreasing fusion power generation, therefore, impurities effect on heating and transport must be fully understood. The ultimate aim of investigating the effects of impurity on neoclassical and anomalous transport by varying the plasma impurities and plasma parameters is to better understand, control, and predict the flow of impurities in tokamak plasmas of several different conditions. The goal of these studies is to gain a deeper understanding of physics underlying the stability of MHD and drift modes as well as energy and particle/impurity confinement in current and future tokamak fusion reactors. This facilitates the identification of particular transport driving mechanisms and provides a foundation for describing and regulation of transport in current and future tokamaks. Simulations will also be used to analyze interactions between the variety of related physical processes and to model scenarios and to improve the performance of tokamak discharges and to plan new experiments or to extrapolate them to future planned devices."

When the nuclei just bounce off each other, this process is called scattering; when colliding nuclei exchange protons or neutrons, or they stick together, the process is called a reaction. Reactions release the energy that powers stars, and inside stars and the Big Bang they are the processes by which all the elements of the periodic table were assembled from protons and neutrons. Understanding the stars and the origin of the elements requires understanding the rates of nuclear reactions in exotic environments. In addition, most experiments to determine the nature of the forces inside the atomic nucleus are based on reaction and scattering processes. The purpose of this project is to improve computer models of nuclear reactions and scattering. Work focuses on ""ab initio"" models of nuclear reactions, in which the motions of all neutrons and protons inside the nucleus are treated explicitly. Variational Monte Carlo and Green's function Monte Carlo methods have been very successful in computing properties of stable nuclei, and they have been applied in the past to some simple examples of scattering. In this project, these methods will be improved and adapted to more complicated scattering problems. By confining the scattering nuclei to a box of finite size, the scattering problem is transformed into a calculation of the energy of the system, followed by evaluation of the quantum mechanical wave function at the surface of the box. The quantum Monte Carlo approaches are especially well suited to this particle-in-a-box approach. The techniques developed will improve both the construction of particle-in-a-box wave functions and the numerical methods that determine their surface properties and consequences for scattering. Calculations here focus mainly on systems of four particles, like scattering of a proton from a helium-3 nucleus, which feature ""coupled channels:"" scattered objects come out of the collision changed in some way from their initial configuration. In the initial cases to be studied, the nuclear spins come out reoriented or the angular momentum of their motion is changed. This is a first step toward modeling reactions, which can be viewed as a form of coupled channels process in which the change involves transferring particles from one nucleus to the other. Comparing the results of these calculations against experimental data will also help to determine the nature of the strong nuclear force holding nuclei together."
"Harnessing methanotroph-photoautotroph interactions for biogas
conversion to fuels and chemicals using binary consortia",Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0019181,"Wang, Jin",Jin.Wang@auburnuniversity,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste streams containing stranded organic carbon represent a significant and underutilized feedstock to produce fuels and chemicals. With anaerobic digestion becoming deployed at large scales to capture organic waste streams, over 6 million tons of biogas are available today. Several DOE studies have suggested that biogas has immense potential to be used as a renewable feedstock for producing high-density fuels and commodity chemicals. However, the utilization of biogas represents a significant challenge due to its low pressure and presence of contaminants such as H2S, ammonia, and volatile organic carbon compounds. To tap into this immense potential, effective biotechnologies that co-utilize both CO2 and CH4 are needed. Recent studies demonstrated that, in nature, microbial communities have developed a highly efficient way to recover the energy and capture carbon from both CH4 and CO2 through metabolic coupling of methane oxidation to oxygenic photosynthesis. From an engineering perspective, coupling methanotrophic metabolism to photosynthesis offers three major advantages for the design of robust microbial catalysts for biogas conversion to high-density fuels and chemicals. First, exchange of in situ produced O2 and CO2 dramatically reduces mass transfer resistance of the two gas substrates; Second, in situ O2 consumption removes inhibition on photoautotroph and eliminates risk of explosion; Third, interdependent yet compartmentalized configuration of the co-culture offers flexibility and more options for metabolic engineering. Using the basic metabolic coupling principles used by natural consortia, our team has built and tested several synthetic photoautotroph - methanotroph co-cultures that exhibit stable growth under a broad range of cultivation conditions. In this project, we will investigate a robust fast-growing co-culture of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 - Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20ZR as robust platform for conversion of raw biogas into biomass feedstock and value-added products. To facilitate this overarching objective, we aim to develop experimental and computational tools to gain qualitative and quantitative understandings on the interactions and dynamics of the co-culture at both systems and molecular levels, and to validate our findings through experiments and mutants development. The research activities will emphasize a multidisciplinary systems approach, which integrates hypothesis-driven experiments with data-driven transcriptomic analyses, and uses genome-scale metabolic modeling to integrate the findings obtained on the potential interactions within the co-culture from the two routes. Our activities are organized around the following research tasks: (i) identification and validation of the systems-level interactions; (ii) identification and validation of cellular level interactions; (iii) development of co-culture genome-scale metabolic models; and (iv) improvement of co-culture cooperation for enhanced production of fuels and chemicals. The fundamental understanding on the interactions and dynamics of the photoautotroph-methanotroph will lay the foundation for the design and optimization of synthetic binary consortia for production of fuels and chemicals from biogas. We expect the knowledge gained from this project may be generally applicable to other cross-feeding binary consortium, and the tools developed can be adapted to study the interactions and dynamics of other multi-organism platforms. The research performed for this project will include researchers at Auburn University (Drs. Jin Wang and Q. Peter He), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Dr. Alexander S. Beliaev), and San Diego State University (Dr. Marina Kalyuzhnaya)."
Structure and Dynamics of Ion-Containing Nanostructured Ternary Polymer Blends,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0017809,"Lodge, Timothy",Timothy.Lodge@regentsoftheuniversityofminnesota,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","A central challenge in next-generation materials is to develop a broadly applicable strategy to systematically tailor nanostructure, in order to simultaneously optimize two (or more) orthogonal properties. A prime example of this competition is to prepare polymeric membranes that exhibit both (a) high transport for selected small molecules or ions, while (b) concurrently exhibiting superior mechanical, thermal and chemical robustness. For a single component polymeric material, any strategy to improve mechanical strength will impede molecular motion. The key to achieving this goal is to prepare a co-continuous nanostructure, in which one domain is responsible for molecular or ionic transport, while the other imparts mechanical strength. Systems containing at least two polymeric components are therefore required, and their attributes and the mixture composition must be designed to impart co-continuity. We have shown that ternary blends comprising A and B homopolymers, plus an A-B block copolymer surfactant, present a broadly tunable and widely applicable strategy to accessing functional co-continuous nanostructures. We have previously pioneered the development of an equilibrium co-continuous nanostructure, the polymeric bicontinuous microemulsion, in systems with both added ions and with a charged polymer component. The goal now is to build on these initial discoveries to prepare mechanically robust structures, to understand processing dynamics, and to expand the range of applicable chemistries. Successful realization of such polymer-based materials could profoundly impact a diverse range of technologies, including (but by no means limited to) ion batteries, fuel cell membranes, photovoltaics, flexible displays, actuators, sensors, and portable electronics. In all cases the desirable attributes of polymeric materials, including cost effectiveness, low density, low maintenance, and flexible design, could prove transformative. The focus for this proposal is to build on these discoveries, by expanding both the range of molecular variables and the range of the ternary phase prism to be explored. While phase behavior will continue to play a foundational role, there will be a new emphasis on (i) crosslinking the desired co-continuous phases, (ii) understanding the mechanical and transport properties of the materials, and (iii) exploring the effects of shear flow on nanostructured ternary blends. We also anticipate that the majority of our efforts will be directed toward single-ion conductor blends. Our experimental approach will rely on synthesis of model polymers with well-controlled molar mass, composition, architecture, and charge density. Phase behavior will be examined by a powerful combination of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), bolstered by optical transmission and electron microscopy. Ion transport and segmental dynamics will be followed by conductivity, SANS with in situ dielectric relaxation, and neutron spin echo. Structural dynamics will be explored by in situ rheo-SANS. Model systems will be selectively crosslinked, in order to achieve exceptional combinations of mechanical and conductivity properties."

To do so, it converts the energy of the absorbed light into mechanical energy. Efficient and rapid, this process underlies important functions in nature and technology. Examples include rhodopsin, the molecule responsible for initiating the human vision response, and emerging materials that may be used for photovoltaic cells. However, because the light-induced motion of these molecules is so brief (with changes in shape often occurring in under a millionth of a millionth of a second), it has escaped direct experimental detection. As a result, there is still much not understood about how these molecular switches work and why they are efficient. The objective of this research is to use recently developed pulsed laser technology to watch chromophores change shape over their complete range of motion and during the brief span of time while they are moving. These observations will then be used to confirm theories that explain why the energy conversion can be so efficient. The main samples of this research will be rhodopsins and the building blocks of nucleic acids, which will serve to test the new experimental approach and gain a deeper understanding of the physics and chemistry behind chromophore function. If successful, the findings will inform a next generation of research aiming to harness and control light-induced energy flow on a molecular level."

These topics are approached from chemical, biological, physical experimental and theoretical angles. Further, we do so by connecting the divergent foci that have emerged somewhat independently across the US, UK, and EU. Construction and analysis of these complex chemical systems by researchers in universities, government laboratories, and private research institutes will inform the entire diverse research community about the rules of life and will inspire the design of entirely new types of synthetic matter which mimic some of the properties of living systems. Second, the formal presentations, response questions, discussions at poster sessions, and the casual interactions constitute an opportunity for ideas on new topics and future directions to emerge. Young scholars selected from submitted abstracts and scholars form minority serving institutions will be specifically invited. The value of bringing together senior and established scientists with mid-career scholars, graduate students and postdocs will constitute the second foci of achieving greater inclusive excellence. Timely new results from student talks will extend the discussions and open possibilities for mentoring. We will combine responses in the ending GRC surveys with qualitative informal interviews to assess the value of the format. We expect the germination of new ideas and new collaborations among the attendees will lead to new proposals to DOE and other federal agencies and that these new ideas will be of significant value to our communities that span continents."

Barada, Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCLA (Principal Investigator) T. Carter, Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCLA (Co-Principal Investigator) The primary objectives of this research are to: (1) Analyze and understand the role of multiscale transport in the pedestal of ELM-free plasmas from the available dataset of multifield turbulence measurements from recent DIII-D campaigns by comparing these measurements to existing gyrokinetic simulations and motivate new gyrokinetic simulations by providing profile and fluctuation data to identify the different instabilities and their potential role in edge thermal and particle transport; (2) In collaboration with DIII-D scientists, diagnosticians and experimental leaders of future DIII-D campaigns, UCLA will design and lead focused experiments on the role of multi-field/multi-scale turbulence on transport in the transport limited edge regions of ELM-free DIII-D regimes. These experiments will utilize UCLA turbulence diagnostics as well as the full range of DIII-D turbulence and profile diagnostics; and (3) In addition to the above focused effort, UCLA will also actively support an array of research efforts led by other DIII-D scientists and visiting scientists through discussion, data analysis, contributions to journal articles and invited talks, planning of experiments, etc. This research will use the following methods and approach: (1) The existing experimental dataset of the above non-ELMing regimes in DIII-D will be analyzed and compared with predictions from existing gyrokinetic turbulence simulations. This will aid in identifying the nature of the observed instabilities, testing simulations and models, and, most importantly, guiding the designing/planning of future experiments; (2) Identify the gaps in existing experimental measurements required for input to the gyrokinetic simulations and subsequently acquire the key experimental fluctuation and profile data to fill this gap with careful planning of future experiments; and (3) In collaboration with the DIII-D team (including both on and offsite collaborators), UCLA will then utilize the improved understanding of turbulence transport mechanisms to increase the operational space of these regimes and project these regimes to future burning plasmas. This will also strengthen the ability of the US Fusion Science Program by establishing itself as a leader in demonstrating safe and ELM-free scenarios to ITER with confidence. This UCLA effort will directly support several of the current DIII-D 5-year plan goals. The specific goals supported are expanding the operating space of ELM controlled regimes, understand QH-mode edge transport enhancements and determining the role of 3D fields and fluctuations in driving pedestal transport. Complete characterization and understanding of turbulence driven transport in naturally occurring ELM-free (QH- and wide-pedestal QH-mode) high performance plasmas will enable us to reach these goals."

Next- generation associated-particle imaging (API) with emphasis on high-speed, human portability and multi- modal interrogation capability, including transmission radiography and induced emission (fission, elastic scatter, inelastic gamma) imaging, is required. The problem is being addressed by: (1) increasing the output of a neutron generator while simultaneously improving its spot size for sharper imaging, and (2) coupling with high-speed electronics and detection elements in an end-mounted target API configuration for end-user application flexibility. Phase I & II demonstrated spot size, output and pathway for API integration—leveraging recent DARPA investment through the Intense Compact Neutron Source program. Phase IIA will integrate API detectors onto an nGen®-400 human-portable sealed generator for field testing with National Laboratory collaboration for technology readiness assessment and comparative testing. The overall approach takes advantage of Starfire’s grounded target for maximum imaging utilization. Beyond national security needs, the technology has immediate application for soil carbon monitoring for permanence and durability, commercial cargo manifest screening for packages, parcels and unit load air cargo inspection, as well as customs and border patrol applications for illicit drugs, explosives and contraband materials.

However, complexity and cost of deploying applications impedes industrial adoption. Problems include the quality, speed, and flexibility of software tools and the specialized expertise required to adapt solutions given the profusion of hardware configurations. Efficient data reading and writing (I/O) remain a key bottleneck in standard approaches, often limiting the scalability of application codes, reducing the scale and scope of problems that can be addressed with simulation. How the problem is begin addressed: This SBIR/STTR Phase II will support the deployment of PIDX, a high-performance parallel I/O library, which scales efficiently to a million cores on DoE flagship HPC systems. The key innovation enabling high-performance I/O is a proprietary hierarchical space-filling data layout that delivers optimal performance for memory hierarchies. PIDX and the ViSUS framework enables fast visualization and analysis, even for petabytes of data stored on remote systems. This SBIR/STTR will make this technology accessible for commercial use by reducing the time and complexity of installing and using the PIDX library and ViSUS framework. Phase I results and Phase II course of action: Phase I hardening and deploying the PIDX library in the Uintah project resulted in reducing the I/O cost from 49% to 2% of the compute time, effectively dou- bling scientific productivity. With a very conservative estimate of just 2 cents per core compute hour, this simulation was completed with over $3M in savings for the DOE, already returning more than double the investment costs for the proposed Phase II SBIR/STTR grant. This SBIR/STTR Phase II will continue to harden the existing PIDX library and deploy performance improvements. The PIDX library will be lever- aged to enhance post-simulation analysis and visualization workflows. Finally, the breadth of simulations accelerated by PIDX will be expanded by developing support for adaptive resolution meshes. Commercial impact and societal benefit: A simple and efficient I/O ecosystem is a prerequisite component of engineering and industrial use of HPC systems. Removing I/O bottleneck will enable more efficient use of expensive HPC resources, allow larger and higher-fidelity simulations for more accurate modeling, and reduce the cost and complexity of writing scaling simulation codes. The data addressed by this project is already being produced and utilized commercially in reservoir simulations in oil and gas exploration, fluid dynamics studies in aerospace industries, and computational electromagnetics in manufacturing processes. The industrial HPC market saw a 10% growth in the first quarter of 2015, which is further expected to expand as additional applications are adopted. The I/O library supported by this SBIR/STTR will furthermore ease the burden of scaling, as today&rsquo;s scientific research capacity runs become tomorrow&rsquo;s commercial capability processing."

Wood, University of Missouri (Principal Investigator) David Braun, University of Missouri (Co-Investigator) Human civilization depends on plants for the oxygen we breathe, as well as food, fiber, fuel, and innumerable ecosystem services. Global climate change threatens plants and life on Earth. Confronting the challenges posed by climate change is an urgent societal imperative. The plant science community will play a central role in mitigation and adaptation efforts to ensure food, water and energy security. We have developed the 38th University of Missouri (MU) Interdisciplinary Plant Group’s (IPG) Annual Symposium around the theme of Enhancing the Resilience of Plant Systems to Climate Change. This will bring together experts at the intersections of disciplines to educate the community on the opportunities to develop innovative mitigation strategies and to adapt plants to climate change. Fundamental understanding of plants and their responses to climate change from the level of molecular events to ecosystem scales is essential to developing adaptation strategies, and enhancing energy security in a sustainable fashion through bioenergy innovations. Strong interdisciplinary research efforts are essential to solving these grand challenges. The theme of this symposium is intimately linked with DOE’s core mission of ensuring, “…America’s security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions.” This symposium will bring together a range of experts from diverse disciplines working at a broad range of scales to exchange information and stimulate collaborations to address these grand challenges. This symposium will promote systems-level understanding of plants and their interactions with biotic and abiotic factors that supports the development of novel plants with improved yields and/or stress tolerance to provide bioenergy solutions. These aims are tightly aligned with the mission of BER’s Environmental Genomics program, as well as having relevance to Earth System Science programs. One of the primary goals of all IPG symposia is fostering the career development of students, postdoctoral fellows and early career scientists, particularly those from underrepresented groups. These symposia provide learning, networking opportunities and exposure to interdisciplinary research that taken together, will be an invaluable experience. Instilling the virtues of interdisciplinary collaboration extends the benefits to society because we are equipping the next generation of scientists with the mindset and approaches needed to tackle big societal challenges. This symposium will provide a platform for women and underrepresented groups to advance their careers by providing visibility of their work at a world-renowned meeting, attended by numerous distinguished scientists, three of whom are members of the National Academy of Sciences."
Water foraging with dynamic roots in E3SM; The role of roots in terrestrial ecosystem memory on intermediate timescales,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020285,"Berkelhammer, Max",Max.Berkelhammer@boardoftrusteesoftheuniversityofillinois,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Terrestrial ecosystems often display a sustained response to climate anomalies, such as drought, for multiple years after the event has occurred. This phenomenon - often referred to as &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; or &ldquo;memory&rdquo; - is poorly represented in earth system models. This observation highlights the presence of missing dynamics in these models and limits their capacity to provide skillful forecasting information for multiple years. While numerous hypotheses exist to explain the presence of intermediate-scale memory in terrestrial ecosystems, existing work on this topic has largely neglected the role that changes in root profiles play in generating legacy. We hypothesize that as root systems forage for water, the modified depth distribution of fine roots persists for multiple years. The root legacy, in turn, alters ecosystem primary productivity and net exchange of carbon with the atmosphere. These root dynamics are not standard components of current earth system models, which generally use simplifying assumptions about the passivity of root systems including static depth profiles and a fixed period of time for root mortality (i.e. turnover time). These assumptions are in contrast to observations, which have noted highly plastic profiles and turnover times for fine roots that vary between months and years. Theory and observations thus suggest that the addition of dynamic root profiles and both longer and more heterogeneous root turnover times in earth system models would enable multi-year legacy effects to emerge in model simulations. This proposal will use a recently a developed dynamic root model within the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) to explore the role that root dynamics play in multi-year ecosystem legacies for three long term forested AmeriFlux sites in the central United States. One of the challenges in developing and applying a dynamic root model for earth system models is the absence of datasets to validate temporal variability in root systems beyond 1 or 2 seasons. To address this challenge, we will generate a reconstruction of root dynamics for 4-5 decades using a recently developed approach to study root water uptake from high resolution isotopic analysis of tree ring cellulose. This data will provide an empirical constraint on the variability of root dynamics over decadal timescales in response to a wide spectrum of external forcing such as drought and heat waves. This unique observational dataset will then be used to find optimal model configurations for root turnover times and foraging dynamics within E3SM. Using an ensemble of model simulations that include and exclude optimal root dynamics, we will then quantify how modulating belowground roots enhances aboveground legacy effects. By improving the representation of legacy effects in earth system models, this project will improve the capacity for this model to provide near term (1-2 year) projections. The proposed work plan will also provide a general experimental and modeling framework that can be applied more broadly across other AmeriFlux and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites. Lastly, the multi-decadal validation dataset will be available to continue to test dynamic root models in other models such as the Functionally-Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES) and Community Terrestrial System Model (CTSM)."

Such collisions heat up nuclear matter to about two billion degrees, conditions that are believed to have existed a millionth of a second after the Big Bang. Our research is centered on a multifaceted involvement in the 68-institution STAR experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. The ultimate goal of STAR is to understand highly excited sub-nuclear matter, by discovering the role played by quarks and the particles that mediate their interactions. The particular physics focus of our group includes the study of (i) collision fragments containing the relatively rare heavy quarks, a task which calls for extremely accurate calibration and alignment of detectors with unprecedented spatial resolution, and (ii) various patterns and asymmetries displayed by the ejected collision fragments, with a special emphasis on the behavior when the initial energy of the collision is varied. Our current effort has relevance for the possible discovery of a change in the phase of nuclear matter that mathematically resembles the phase change between ice and liquid water. During the upcoming 3-year period, our effort will particularly emphasize the study and publication of data optimized for heavy quark physics, as well as analysis of a recent round of experiments over a broad range of collision energies. In practice, a good fraction of our future effort will continue to be devoted to detector-related software tasks which facilitate the research of the entire STAR collaboration, especially the optimization of upgrade projects that have recently added powerful new measurement capabilities."

In particular, correlated wave function approaches such as electronic structure quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) will be employed and further developed to address many-body quantum effects in systems that are difficult to study with traditional approaches. In particular, we will explore the potential of the recently developed QMC variable-spin approach for nearly-exact treatment of correlation energies. These advances will enable us to calculate very accurately both ground and excited states that are of crucial importance for understanding behavior of materials in various phases and under influence of external fields. Furthermore, we plan to expand QMC calculations to low and ambient temperatures with the full account of complicated many-body quantum effects. This direction will involve both stochastic and traditional approaches and their combinations for sampling of the spectrum domain that is relevant for a given temperature window. Alternatively, we plan to couple Density Functional Theory with subsequent QMC corrections using correlated sampling approaches for calculations of quantities such as electron-phonon couplings and impact of temperature on excitations. These developments will be applied for obtaining insights into quantum phenomena in several classes of materials. One high-value application target is the many-body physics of 2D materials with 5d elements such 5d metal-dichalcogenides that exhibit a number of quantum phenomena with the potential of becoming a new type of promising technological materials. Another important class of applications will involve understanding impacts of spin-orbit effects in 5d bulk materials such as iridate compounds. These research plans are related to the DOE core mission in several ways and they are of significant importance to the current research at DOE laboratories."

The concepts developed in this project feature topics and processes central to solar photochemistry and solar energy conversion, leveraging metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), ligand-field (LF), ligand-centered (LC), and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited states. New classes of visible-light absorbing Cu(I) MLCT-based photosensitizers will continue to be developed intended for driving excited state chemistry. One homoleptic molecular design to be developed includes the exploration of new 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline Cu(I) complexes bearing various 2,9-cycloalkane substituents to expand the inventory of available long-lifetime Cu(I) MLCT photosensitizers. A second approach targets new Cu(I)-based sensitizers designed to possess markedly extended excited state lifetimes (10’s to 100’s of µs) using pendant triplet perinone and thionated perinone acceptors to intramolecularly produce either “pure” organic ligand-localized triplets or equilibrated excited states based on the triplet reservoir effect. Several Cr(III) photosensitizer designs are presented to access their 2E LF excited state. One is focused on ethynyl-arene substitution of phenanthroline ligands whose chemistry is akin to related heterocyclic ligands prepared in the previous funding cycle. Another relates to manipulating phenanthroline ligand structures to sensitize the 2E excited state in Cr(III) using primarily ligand-centered organic-based triplet excited states to generate panchromatic absorbing photosensitizers through diimine coordination chemistry in addition to cyclometalating strategies. Potential doublet-doublet annihilation photochemistry will be assessed using the proposed Cr(III) molecules. Zr(IV) LMCT photosensitizer designs made available through a continuing collaboration are focused on newly conceived ligand structures to produce excited states with extended lifetimes suitable for driving photochemical upconversion reactions.

At ATLAS, the production of such beams is provided via in-flight method and grants access to more than 100 short-lived isotopes in the mass range up to A~60. However, after traversing the production target, the primary beam is energy degraded and acquires a long low-intensity energy tail from the multiple-scattering processes in the target material. At ATLAS, the RF sweeper, operating 6 MHz with maximum voltage of 55kV is used. However, this voltage is not sufficient for a clean separation of many beams such as 37K at 275 MeV, where at least twice as high of a voltage is required. In response to this problem, RadiaBeam is developing an RF sweeper operating at ATLAS fundamental harmonic frequency (12 MHz) with a 150 kV kicks that is triple of the voltage achieved with the existing ATLAS sweeper. During Phase I, we found that for lower energy beams, ~ 5 MeV/u, the frequency of 6 MHz would be preferable because of the flight time, so the design must include two frequencies to cover the whole range of the beam species. The switch of frequency regimes can be performed manually in between the tests. In Phase II we had to completely reconsider the design of the sweeper due to the requirements for two frequency operation with twice higher voltage than planned initially. To date, we resolved all challenges corresponding to these new requirements and finished the engineering design. We started the sweeper resonator fabrication to be completed by the end of the phase. We have also designed and fabricated a 2 kW solid-state generator module, sufficient for initially planned single-frequency 75 kV operation, which is currently being tested. The complexity of the design initially proposed for Phase II has increased significantly due to the requirements for RF power, reliability, fabrication feasibility of the large vacuum vessel, the development frequency switch, and the need for highly efficient solid-state RF power sources for two frequencies. In view of these challenges, we propose the Phase IIA continuation of this project is to successfully complete the originally planned initial Phase II prototype. In this sequential Phase II project, we will finalize the design and fabricate all components that are essential for the sweeper operation, including high power switch and full-power RF power sources for both frequencies. The sweeper prototype will then be delivered to ATLAS for high-power and beam tests. The results of this work will be of immediate benefit to the ATLAS facility. In addition, a similar separator could be used at FRIB for radioactive beam separation. RF sweepers are also of interest for mass- spectrometry as they can provide very precise isotope separation, which is critical for security, defense, and environmental applications."

The discovery, screening, and optimization of quantum defects and emitters are essential for America’s global competitiveness. However, these goals are extremely challenging because of the lack of an integrated instrument for rapid quantum defect characterization of their full set of relevant physical parameters in a multimodal fashion. Advanced Research Systems (ARS) in collaboration with Professor Markus Raschke and Professor Shuo Sun (University of Colorado and JILA, Boulder) will develop a cryogenic quantum optical and spin probe station for high-throughput characterization of solid-state quantum defects. This instrument includes local probe imaging with atomic resolution, nano-optical and confocal spectroscopy, and spin resonance measurement. The instrument provides a new correlative approach and tool for rapid quantum defect spectroscopy, imaging, and screening. The instrument is enabled through an innovative approach by ARS based on the development of 4 K pneumatic drive Solvay cryocoolers and their techniques for decoupling the cryocooler cold head from the sample space using a helium exchange gas interface in combination with a new tabletop vibration isolation structure. During Phase I the tabletop vibration isolation prototype was designed, manufactured, and tested at ARS, then shipped to the University of Colorado for integration and testing with an atomic force microscope (AFM). The noise levels using the tabletop prototype matched those of a permanently anchored AFM benchmark system, paving the way for further development in Phase II. Additional Phase I accomplishments included setup and automation of far-field optical components, which will be integrated with the AFM/near-field components in the proposed Phase II prototype. Phase II will focus on the development of a fully integrated quantum probe station for correlative and automated laser scanning, optical nano-probe, and spin resonance measurements at variable and cryogenic temperature. Automated realignment and measurement at variable temperature, magnetic field, and excitation wavelength will be developed. The Phase II goals are to demonstrate the quantum probe station performance for large-scale screening and discovery of solid-state quantum defects, leading to the commercialization of this system. The quantum probe station product will be manufactured and sold by ARS under the name “Avalanche”. It will feature automated test and measurement, data acquisition and processing, and real-time visualization.

This project seeks to advance our understanding of each of these processes via a modular experimental synthesis, measurement, and analysis strategy that capitalizes on the periodicity, uniformity, molecular-scale porosity, aqueous acid and base stability, very broad chemical compositional versatility, ease of synthesis, ease of integration with electrodes, and ease of chemical elaboration of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Chromophoric versions of these frameworks can function as antennae for capturing visible-region photons and delivering the stored energy to semiconducting electrodes for light-to-electrical energy conversion and to framework-supported/integrated catalysts for light-to-chemical energy conversion, where the chemical reactions of are chiefly reductive and oxidative water splitting to make molecular hydrogen, with molecular oxygen as a mass-balancing byproduct, multi-electron reduction of CO2. They also capitalize on the ability to characterize the structures, arrangement, and organization of these compounds with atomic precision – capabilities enabled, in part, by DOE’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) and National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) facilities. Compelling scientific motivations for obtaining ultra-precise structural information are that the obtained information can be mechanistically revealing, and can render corresponding predictive property computations extraordinarily effective, predictive, and accurate. Three fundamental and practical challenges addressed by the project are: usefully harvesting light across the full visible spectrum; transporting stored energy, in the form of photo-generated molecular excitons, over hundreds of nanometers in pre-determined directional fashion; and transporting electrons or holes over similar distances, through nominally electrically insulating MOFs, and delivering them at rates consistent with driving catalysts fast enough that turnover of the catalyst itself is rate-limiting, even when framework-immobilized catalysts are present at levels equivalent to hundreds of molecular monolayers. In support of this work, the project makes use of MOF-synthesis and elaboration methods previously devised in our lab. It also makes use of a new noncovalent, but chemically and mechanically robust approach to assembling 2D-arrays of molecules – specifically for understanding panchromatic light-collection and coupled chemical catalysis, without resorting to overly complex and time-intensive, chemical synthesis. Notably, the approach is adaptable to selected natural pigments such as chlorophyll a and related accessary pigments. For understanding the chemical nature and down-stream dynamics of complex energy-conversion processes initiated by photo-exciting MOF-linker-based arrays of chromophores, the project: a) exploits methods devised in our lab for synthesis and uniform immobilization of functional metal-oxide clusters of predetermined size, and b) interrogates post-excitation, structural responses via ultrafast time-resolved X-ray spectroscopic methods."
Dissection of Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling in Post-Fire Soil Environments using a Genome-Informed Experimental Community,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020351,"Whitman, Thea","Thea.Whitman@boardofregentsoftheuniversityofwisconsinsystem,operatingasuniversityofwisconsin-madison","['approach', 'method', 'electron', 'new', 'project', 'system', 'plant', 'interaction']","Wildfires are a natural part of many forest ecosystems, with globally important carbon (C) storage and nutrient cycling consequences, and they are increasing in frequency and severity in western North America. Forest fires affect soil C stocks in complex ways. Some C is released into the atmosphere through combustion, while a large percentage of the C is added to the soil in the form of pyrogenic (fire-affected) organic matter (PyOM). Worldwide, it is estimated that 16% of soil organic matter (SOM) is pyrogenic, while in areas with frequent fires, this number may be as high as 80%. Understanding how wildfires affect SOM cycling requires understanding how microbes respond to PyOM and other post-fire soil conditions. However, our understanding of microbial interactions with post-fire soil is in its infancy. Outstanding questions include: Which microbes are capable of degrading PyOM? What are the relevant genes and metabolites associated with this degradation? How does the presence of nutrients such as nitrogen (N) affect post-fire PyOM and SOM degradation? What are the key interactions among post-fire microbes? We have developed resources during our previous DOE grant (DE-SC0016365) that enable us to dissect the post-fire environment. These include: a 13CO2 labeling growth chamber, a &ldquo;charcoalator&rdquo; for producing PyOM, &ldquo;pyrocosms&rdquo; for simulating depth-resolved effects of fire, and a collection of genomic resources including 12 genome-sequenced pyrophilous fungi and more than 80 pyrophilous bacterial isolates (20 of which are about to be sequenced). We will use these in combination with genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and stable isotope techniques to address the following specific objectives: 1) Determine how dominant post-fire soil microbes affect the fate of PyOM; 2) Assess the interaction between N availability and PyOM mineralization by post-fire microbial communities and individual pyrophilous microbes; 3) Define the network of microbial interactions that facilitate PyOM breakdown over time and the key genes involved. The proposed research directly addresses the GSP program goals of achieving a predictive, systems-level understanding of plants, microbes, and biological communities, by improving understanding of mechanisms and processes controlling the impacts of wildfire on C and N cycling in soils. Our approach incorporates hypothesis-driven observations, experimental manipulations, and ecological theory, with the tools of genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics at isolate and community scales. Our findings will be relevant for ecosystem management, post-fire recovery, and fundamental microbial genomics, ecology, and biogeochemistry."

The artificial photosynthesis approach to solar fuels integrates light absorption with interfacial chemistry, thus offering a potential strategy for long-term storage of solar energy as energy-dense liquid fuel. This renewal proposal builds on recent advances made by the PI’s group and others in creating solar water splitting systems based on dye-sensitized semiconductors. New architectures for dye-sensitized photoanodes and photocathodes that will improve their efficiency and stability, and membranes that will enable their use in integrated solar fuel systems will be developed. The principal goals of this project are to develop (1) new solvent systems, polymeric sensitizers, and solid state architectures for more efficient and stable water oxidation at dye-sensitized photoanodes, (2) bipolar membranes based on weak acid polyelectrolytes that can manage proton balance efficiently in CO2 photoelectrolysis, and (3) catalyzed semiconductor photocathodes that can be used in a complete system for solar fuel generation. The photoanode studies in this project will build on prior kinetic and modeling studies, which have shown that light-induced charge transfer at the dye-oxide semiconductor interface is the largest source of efficiency loss. Oligomeric photosensitizers that bind persistently to oxide semiconductors near neutral pH will be modified to promote rapid charge injection, and will be covalently bonded to molecular water oxidation catalysts to study the effects of the sensitizer:catalyst ratio on the kinetics of the four-electron oxidation of water. Mixed solvent systems that can promote rapid charge injection at the photoanode will be studied, and the sources of series impedance in solid-state dye-sensitized photoanodes will be analyzed by transient electrochemical methods. The photocathode study will investigate molecular surface modifiers for nanoparticles that catalyze CO2 reduction in order to understand the effects of reactant preconcentration at the surface. These chemically modified catalyst nanoparticles will be studied on porous p-type silicon photoelectrodes for light-driven CO2 reduction. This project will also build on recent findings that bipolar membranes can address the system-level problem of proton balance in the photoelectrolysis of water and CO2. Conventional bipolar membranes combine strongly acidic and strongly basic ion-conducting layers and function most effectively with cathode processes that operate at low pH. To explore the possibility of electrolysis in more basic media, where CO2 reduction is most efficient, this project will also investigate bipolar membranes that contain weak acid cation-exchange layers and weak base interfacial layers that catalyze the water dissociation reaction. The kinetics of water dissociation, ion transport, and crossover of electrolysis products in weak acid bipolar membrane cells will be studied by steady-state and dynamic electrochemical methods coupled with numerical modeling. The three themes of this project will together inform the ultimate goal of making integrated tandem-absorber systems for the photoelectrochemical production of fuels and fuel feedstocks from CO2, water, and sunlight."

The pulsed power current can produce a slowly rising pressure ramp that compresses a solid material to a high density without significant heating. Material properties of such high density, low temperature plasmas known as warm dense matter (WDM) are critical information in models for the interior of giant planets and laser fusion cores. Most pulsed power WDM experiments are conducted in a planar geometry at a large facility because of a well-established optical diagnostic available and tens of MA of current required for high compression. Alternatively, cylindrical compression is an attractive approach because of its high compressibility than that in the planar geometry and its direct relevance to the magnetized liner inertial fusion concept. However, the dense cylinder shape plasma requires a hard x-ray or energetic charged particle source to diagnose the plasma condition. The objective of this experimental program is to develop and demonstrate short-pulse laser-based diagnostics for pulsed power-driven cylindrically compressed wires using a 50 TW short-pulse laser Leopard and a 1 MA pulsed power generator Zebra at the University of Nevada Reno. A millimeter-diameter metal wire will be cylindrically compressed by the Zebra current with a ~100 ns rise time, while the Leopard laser will irradiate a metal target to produce hard x rays that can penetrate into the high-density wire. In this work, we will specifically focus on development of high-resolution x-ray radiography using broadband and monochromatic x rays. Broadband x-ray radiography (> 20 keV) will produce high quality x-ray images providing information on the diameter and density of the compressed wire. Monochromatic x-ray imaging with a spherically bent crystal will enable more accurate density measurements than the broadband x-ray imaging. The temporal evolution of the wire density will be obtained by varying the laser timing with respect to the pulsed power current. Systematic data sets of the wire plasmas will be collected for various wire diameters, materials, and thicknesses of plastic coating on the wire. This program will produce a variety of invaluable experimental and technical data addressing both the feasibility of short-pulse laser-based x-ray radiography and the WDM creation capability with the cylindrical compression scheme. The experimental data on the compressed density and wire diameter could be used for benchmarking magnetohydrodynamics simulation codes. Successful demonstration of the cylindrical compression to create WDM on Zebra could promote pulsed power-driven WDM research at university scale and next generation repetitive pulsed power facilities combined with high-power lasers. This program will also support local undergraduate and graduate students to gain a variety of hands-on training experience including participation of the experiments, data collections and analyses."

Lin, University of California-Irvine (Institutional Principal Investigator) E. Kolemen, Princeton University (Institutional Principal Investigator) This project aims to leverage the unique research capabilities of international tokamak facilities to develop a unified physics basis, predictive capability, and long-pulse demonstration for the control of edge-localized modes (ELMs) with optimized non-axisymmetric (3D) fields. ELMs constitute a major challenge to the operation of fusion-grade tokamak plasmas such as ITER due to the large impulsive heat loads delivered to plasma-facing components during ELM excitation. US scientists pioneered the development of the 3D field approach to ELM control and have since played a crucial role in exporting the technique to international facilities such as the KSTAR tokamak in Korea, the EAST tokamak in China, and the AUG tokamak in Germany. As a result of this work, 3D fields are now foreseen as the primary ELM control technique for ITER. This project complements active work on US domestic facilities to further understand and optimize the 3D field ELM control technique by enabling access to the unique plasma regimes and long-pulse operation available on the aforementioned international facilities, and thus expands the viability and applicability of this US-pioneered control technique towards the ITER era. The project addresses high-priority research questions and necessary operational demonstrations sequentially, with the ultimate goal of a developing predictive capability for optimized 3D coil and plasma scenario design, culminating in demonstrating long-pulse stationary ELM suppressed discharges in KSTAR. The proposal is structured into six cross-cutting tasks: Task 1 focuses on targeted experiments to resolve open issues in ELM suppression access criteria leveraging the key capabilities of international facilities. Task 2 uses this information to develop empirical and first-principles scaling laws for extrapolation. Task 3 enhances the predictive understanding of the transport changes implicit in the earlier tasks and validates key scaling trends. Task 4 applies earlier results to the prediction and optimization of divertor heat flux profiles in ELM suppressed scenarios. Task 5 develops real-time control of key actuators to enable routine long-pulse ELM suppressed operation. Finally, the scaling laws are further applied in Task 6 to the development of innovative 3D coils to isolate the spectral components of interest for more reactor relevant 3D field ELM control."

Currently used GS20 glass scintillator works well but cannot provide the desired resolution performance due to its low brightness. A bright, fast, high spatial resolution scintillator will improve the spatial resolution and throughput of the single crystal diffractometer at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We propose to address the limitations of GS20 by using an advanced scintillator, made in a large area, microcolumnar film format that heretofore was not possible to grow because of the extreme hygroscopic nature of the material. This choice is based on the known high brightness of the material, which emits a relatively low number of photons/MeV gamma, but is expected to yield as many as 50,000 to 100,000 photons per thermal neutron interaction, a factor ~8 to 16 times higher yield than current GS20 glass. The high thermal neutron efficiency of this material implies that only ~1.0 mm of scintillator thickness is needed to absorb about 60% of 1Å neutrons. The very thinness of the scintillator helps significantly in discriminating against gammas by minimizing the probability of both photoelectric absorption and light conversion efficiency for gammas. Finally, one of the key innovative approaches we plan to pursue is to realize large-area scintillators. In the Phase I, RMD Inc. used physical vapor deposition to make screens of scintillation material, as well as dope or co-dope the material with divalent or trivalent ions to improve the speed. The entire deposition and sealing process was carried out in a moisture free atmosphere using a newly developed technique at RMD. The spatial resolution for neutrons was estimated as less than 300 µm, with better than 1x10-6 gamma rejection, and 60% neutron absorption efficiency. In the Phase II, RMD Inc. will maximize the light output by optimizing the dopant concentration, and scale- up deposition to large sizes. Additionally, we will protect the scintillator from moisture using a unique conformal coating, and a new type of hermetic sealing. The efficacy of the scintillator will be demonstrated at ORNL with less than 300 µm spatial resolution when coupled to the detector, ~1x10-7 gamma rejection and 60% neutron absorption efficiency for a 1 mm thick scintillator screen. The scintillator will be coupled to the existing pixelated readout and the detector will be delivered to ORNL for immediate use. RMD’s scintillator/detector will be an excellent choice for neutron detectors for any facility that runs neutron experiments. For example, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, large-area detectors at the Spallation Neutron Source are used for neutron scattering experiments and in materials research for a variety of applications. Including the U.S. facilities, there are 45 neutron research centers located around the world that will want to take advantage of our technology."

Maintaining high quantum efficiency (QE) avoids laser-induced nonlinearities. State- of-the-art is 100 pC bunches from copper (????,??0.4 ??m). Advances towards 0.1 ??m require ultra- low emittance, high QE, cryo-compatible materials. This proposal minimizes physical and chemical roughness of high QE alkali antimonides to reduce emittance. Single crystal epitaxial growth is planned through novel substrate lattice-matching and ion-beam-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (IBA-MBE). Such cathodes are anticipated to achieve excellent electron transport favorable for high QE and low emittance due to the single or large grain crystal structure with few grain boundaries and minimal crystal defects. It is anticipated that when operated cryogenically at high field, Cs3Sb intrinsic emittance can approach a record 0.1 ??m/mm (5 meV mean transverse energy).Our objective was true epitaxial growth toward large grain or single crystal alkali antimonide photocathodes. We achieved (1) epitaxial growth on a new lattice- matched substrate with stunning 0.157 nm rms physical roughness and 4% QE in Cs3Sb, (2) the first-ever chemical roughness maps of an active alkali antimonide. (3) a near-zero calculated contribution to emittance from the measured roughness, even at higher field (=10 MV/m), and (4) a feasible Phase II design for IBA-MBE. Based on these completed tasks and our innovative solutions we now have a clear path to product development and prototyping in Phase II. In Phase II, cryogenic 20 K gun test at 10 MV/m field and high laser fluence will demonstrate ultra-low emittance of epitaxial cathodes. Single crystal IBA-MBE will measure crystallinity, stoichiometry, roughness, and band structure. A Monte Carlo model of emission will inform analysis. We will assess compatibility with superconducting RF photoinjectors, and open a production capability. Phase II will conclude with demonstrated ability to produce a new class of ultra-low emittance electron sources, well prepared to commercialize in Phase III. The potential market for high QE, low emittance photocathodes is significant. Such sources are of broad interest to light sources and accelerators, including SRF facilities such as SLAC's LCLS-II HE, Fermilab's IARC, and RF linac based FELs for industrial applications, as well as ultrafast UED/UEM."

The system monitors and synchronizes timestamps collected with local timing, and performs the event building of the data chunks from multiple detector sub-systems, front-end (FE) electronics and sensors. All FE signals are transported through optical fiber using our passive optical networks technology. Our miniature, radiation-hard on-detector FE interface modules provide the electro-optical conversion. The timing, event building, trigger/filtering, data reconstruction, and waveform analysis is performed on commercial GPU cards receiving data from IPAGs through PCIe. Both the direct optical transport capabilities, and the IPAG&ndash;GPU PCIe tandem, provide a massive increase in end-to-end data bandwidth, flexibility, and scalability, at a much lower cost. Furthermore, CF-TDAQ performs continuous acquisition, and multilevel triggering and filtering capability, all implemented in software. The foundation of CF-TDAQ is a ubiquitous, passive timing synchronization through our patent-pending General Timing Synchronization protocol (GTS). From a general information theory perspective, both the signals generated by particle detectors, and the network data flowing through the network links are transmission events. Our patent-pending Continuous Asynchronous TDC timestamps any transmission event with a local time reference provided by a free-running, low cost, highly stable oscillator array (OA). Numerical processing algorithms, running on GPU, provide timestamp matching, and determine the relative, end-to-end time relationships as a polynomial correction function, that is updated during every synchronization cycle. Local timestamps are converted to a single absolute time of the experiment with picosecond accuracy. Our approach eliminates the need for a custom, costly, and failure-prone Timing and Trigger Control system (TTC). The BE IPAG board interfaces between high-bandwidth digital data links from FE sensors, like silicon pixel trackers (e.g. CERN&rsquo;s GBT) or FE ADCs, and the data network (NIC function) through embedded transceivers and high-density MTP or minipod multi-fiber connectors. Finally, the IPAG has a daughter card option which provides full waveform sampling analysis and allows for direct interfacing to analog signals generated by FE sensors.

The developments in these architectures have been driven by machine learning/artificial intelligence applications where lower precision computing is frequently used. To properly leverage these advanced architectures, scientific computing algorithms must be able to utilize lower precision computing without sacrificing the needed levels of accuracy. This project seeks to use these lower precision calculations specifically applied to high fidelity, multi-physics flow simulations (e.g., noise, turbulent combustion, convective heat transfer). Progress to date has shown that targeted use of lower precision computing with algorithmic modifications can replicate acceptable levels of accuracy for problems involving turbine blade heat transfer, high speed jet noise, and other problems where subtle flow phenomena (e.g., aeroacoustics, laminar-turbulent transition, boundary layer separation) need to be predicted. These improvements have had significant impact on throughput as well enabling computations on lower cost graphics processing units. Additional work is proposed to make similar algorithmic improvements for a wider class of multi- physics flows including particle-laden turbulent flows and liquid fueled combustion processes. Proposed work will also continue the validation of these approaches against available experimental data. Successful completion of this work scope would establish theoretical and empirical justification on the viability of reduced precision operations for high fidelity flow simulations. The deployment of these mixed precision algorithms will significantly reduce the cost of high fidelity flow simulation allowing more commercial use of these tools in the engineering design process."

The proposed approach will help to enable next-generation nuclear power generation which will have a significant positive effect on power generation and CO2 emissions in the US and worldwide. Reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and increasing the supply of energy produced from nuclear fuels will have an enormous impact on US energy security and US energy demand with abundant emission-free electricity. In addition, the HTRE developed for this application can be used to corrosion monitoring and control in other molten salt systems such as concentrated solar power (CSP)."

Only the lightest elements (H, He, Li and Be) are formed during the Big Bang. The other elements, all the way to Uranium, are created much later during the various stages of star evolution. This proposal aims at studying in the laboratory setting some of the key nuclear reactions believed to be involved in explosive stellar nucleosynthesis processes. Accelerators, such as ISAC at TRIUMF and ReA3 at NSCL, are used to induce the nuclear reactions in conditions similar than found in stars. Our group focuses on the design, construction and operation of special instrumentation used in these experiments. (2) What is the nature of the nuclear force that binds protons and neutrons into stable nuclei andrare isotopes? The detailed study of the nucleus as a collection of protons and neutrons is a very complex endeavor. One of the main reasons is that it is not possible to solve analytically the many-body problem. However, progress has been made recently thanks to the considerable advance in supercomputing. It is now possible to predict some of the properties of light nuclei starting from the nucleon-nucleon interaction using ab-initio approaches. Three-body corrections have already been shown to exist, especially in a class of light nuclei called halo nuclei. In this context, this proposal aims at studying light neutron-rich nuclei, which are well within the range of ab-initio calculations. Most of this work is done at the two ISAC accelerators at TRIUMF (3) Are the fundamental interactions that are basic to the structure of matter fully understood? Neutrinoless double-beta decay is currently a hot topic in fundamental symmetries and neutrino physics given its strong potential for beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics discovery. In one stroke, an observation of this decay mode would discover lepton number violation and determine the Majorana nature of neutrinos. Our group is involved with the nEXO experiment - a next-generation search for this proposed, rare process of neutrinoless double beta decay. Its concept is based on a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with five tons of liquid xenon (LXe) enriched to 90% 136Xe. Our group is involved with the calibration, simulation, outer detector, Ba-tagging, and background control groups within the collaboration."

Existing drivers (pulsers) operate at only a few kilovolts, and most of them utilize high voltage MOSFET switches. However, MOSFETs suffer from residual resistance, which substantially limits their efficiency, and more importantly they do not demonstrate sharp enough pulse edges. Another existing approach is based on a fixed-length pulse forming network with fast ionization dynistor. It provides with good switching speed but has limitation of adjusting the pulse duration. Thus, current state-of-the-art pulsers are not applicable for the EIC kickers system and there are no reliable US- based vendors of such challenging systems. This project is developing and testing a high output pulse generator based on distributed pulser topology that utilizes novel GaN transistors as switching devices. GaN is a rapidly growing technology that enables both high peak and average power operation along with extremely short switching times of nanosecond- scale, which even creates margin on tight rise and fall times requirements for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) kickers. In Phase I, we designed, fabricated, and tested a scalable power unit based on GaN-technology. The prototype delivers 6 kV voltage amplitude (120 A current) with 3 ns rise and fall times and demonstrates feasibility for scaling to the required 50 kV level with even shorter pulse edges than required by the EIC fast kickers systems. In the proposed Phase II project, we will fabricate a full-scale, dual-channel (positive and negative 50 kV) pulse generator, including a reliable control and monitoring system that can be integrated to the end user’s infrastructure. The final deliverable of this project will be a complete prototype that is tested at the required nominal output power level and is ready for shipment to Brookhaven National Laboratory for further testing. The target segment is nuclear physics accelerator labs, as well as free electron laser and advanced light source facilities. Other applications include civil and military electronic components including radars, power conversion devices, Pockels cells drivers for lasers and high-power electro-optics, ozonators, ground penetration radars, and pulsed radiolysis."

They are key drivers of the ongoing revolution in molecular biology and of many areas of biotechnology, including development of pharmaceuticals and of enzymes and light harvesters for bioenergy. Most biomolecular structures are determined by X-ray crystallography using crystallized biomolecules. Advances in synchrotron X-ray sources, especially at DOE laboratories, have reduced data collection times per crystal from tens of minutes to less than one second, and enabled useful data to be obtained from micrometer size crystals. Advances in structure determination methods using X-ray free-electron laser sources (especially the DOE’s LCLS) have driven worldwide efforts to develop serial synchrotron X-ray crystallography (SSX). In SSX, dozens to tens of thousands of crystals are sequentially irradiated, and data from these crystals merged to determine a biomolecule’s structure. Many sample delivery systems have been developed for SSX, but no one system is ideal for all SSX applications, and the diversity of approaches has hindered adoption of SSX methods. Identifying microcrystals on SSX sample holders remains challenging but is essential to maximize the efficiency of X-ray data collection and processing. This STTR project aims to develop a flexible, integrated, cost-effective platform for sample delivery and imaging in serial synchrotron X-ray crystallography. The sample delivery system incorporates elements from published designs and our innovations to accommodate a variety of real-world sample delivery needs and utilizes to the maximum extent possible the large existing infrastructure for sample handling at DOE laboratories. The imaging system draws on advances at Cornell University in the design of high peak power, femtosecond pulse laser sources and expertise in multimodal laser scanning microscopy that could allow large improvements in microcrystal imaging performance and speed while significantly lowering imaging system costs. In Phase I of this project, prototype sample holders and a sample loading station for serial synchrotron crystallography were designed, fabricated, and tested. Two different approaches to generating femtosecond pulse lasers were explored. A laser meeting our core performance specifications was developed and used to image microcrystals by two-photon excitation fluorescence and second harmonic generation. In Phase II of this project, the sample holders and sample loading station will be evolved to final commercial designs. Development of femtosecond pulse lasers based on the Phase I approaches will continue, focusing on obtaining robust, low cost designs suitable for commercialization. A multimodal laser scanned imaging system for imaging microcrystals on SSX sample holders, incorporating the developed laser, will be constructed. Software for automated recognition of microcrystals and generation of coordinates for efficient synchrotron data collection will be developed. These technologies will speed adoption of SSX methods, which will have a significant impact on structural studies of membrane proteins, large biomolecular machines, and other systems for which obtaining large crystals is challenging. SSX will also dramatically increase structure determination throughput, enabling studies of large numbers of variants of a given biomolecule as required, e.g., in functional optimization of bioenzymes, and of interactions of large numbers of ligands with a given biomolecule as required, e.g., in pharmaceutical development. The proposed work will thus support advances in medical treatments, pharmaceuticals, bioenergy, and biotechnology that will be key drivers of US economic growth in the coming decades. This project and the manufacture and sale of the products it generates will provide good paying jobs and support economic development in the Southern Tier of New York State, which includes many of the state’s most economically depressed counties and cities."

LUX-ZEPLIN: This grant will enable the McKinsey research group at the University of California, Berkeley to test components of the LZ cathode high voltage delivery system, characterize LZ photoneutron calibration sources and photoneutron source delivery system, and analyze LZ data. LZ is a ~7-tonne two-phase xenon dark-matter detector to be installed at the 4850-foot level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota. The LZ experiment will have unprecedented and world-leading sensitivity to WIMP dark matter, probing WIMP-nucleon cross sections down to about 2 x 10-48 cm2 within three years of operation, about 30 times better than current results and covering a substantial range of theoretically motivated candidates.This detector will use established liquid xenon time projection chamber technology with readout of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification, together with 3-D position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the liquid xenon, removal of surface artifacts, and calibration of position-dependent response functions. The design also features a Gd-loaded liquid scintillator veto that will hermetically enclose the central Xe detector and provide powerful tagging of background neutrons and gamma-rays. The UC Berkeley group played a central and successful role on LUX design, construction, operations, and analysis. The emphasis of the group has now moved to the LZ experiment. Prof. McKinsey is LUX Co-Spokesperson, and serves on the LZ Institutional Board, the LZ Conferences Board, and has worked on several LZ technical reviews and task forces. Prof. McKinsey is the Level 3 manager for the LZ cathode high voltage delivery system. The UC Berkeley research group works particularly closely with the LZ group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and interacts frequently with other research groups on LZ, particularly in technical topics related to the liquid xenon detector and calibration systems. DESI: The accelerated expansion of the Universe poses one of the most profound questions in the physical sciences today. Even the most prosaic explanations of cosmic acceleration demand the existence of a pervasive new component of the Universe with exotic physical properties. More extreme alternatives include extra spatial dimensions or a breakdown of General Relativity on cosmological scales. An understanding of this phenomenon continues to elude us, and motivates much of the ``Cosmic Frontiers'' Program within HEP. A conservative experimental strategy involves a multi-pronged approach that combines a variety of cosmological probes — Type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background radiation and large-scale structure. Each probe has benefits and limitations, and each provides complementary information and mutual validation. The research outlined in the following proposal is aimed at developing techniques and understanding experimental data within the context of theoretical models, expressly in support of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Prof. White and his student will develop theoretical tools and analysis methods and apply them to the DESI data so that we may go from processed data to the key scientific results: constraints on modified gravity, dark energy and neutrinos. DESI is a key component of the Cosmic Frontier program, with data taking due to commence roughly at the start of the funding period for this proposal (2020). Detector development: We seek to develop technology required to realise the world's first hybrid optical Cherenkov / scintillation detector. This concept could be deployed at scales up to 10s of ktonnes, impacting programs from long baseline neutrino physics to low energy neutrino physics and astrophysics. This project has two thrusts: (1) Synthesis, development, characterization, and modeling of scintillating target media, by UC Davis, Boston University, LBNL and UC Berkeley. For each viable candidate material, bench-top measurements will form the basis for an optical model, which will be used to determine the impact of deployment on a range of detector configuration options. (2) Analog readout of photon detectors, with the goal of providing improved photon counting and hit-time resolution across a wide dynamic range, from single to many thousands of PE, without the need for full waveform digitisation, which is costly in dollars, CPU and disk space. U. Penn will determine the set of features that can be measured via analog processing, and which yield all required information available in a photon sensor signal, and design an ASIC that would cost $-level per channel, without the deadtime or buffering limitations typical of full WFD. The ability to detect Cherenkov light from highly-scintillating media, and wide-ranging concepts for its use has been recognized in the community as a critical technological breakthrough. Several new and ongoing efforts are investigating the use of relevant materials for future experiments, including ANNIE, NEO (formerly WATCHMAN), and in the longer term the potential for a large multi-purpose detector such as Theia. Results from this work will demonstrate critical technical capabilities needed to realize next-generation detectors in neutrino physics."
Multi-GeV Laser-Plasma Acceleration Physics,Office of High Energy Physics,DE-SC0011617,"Downer, Michael",Michael.Downer@theuniversityoftexasataustin,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Energetic particles from accelerators probe into nature's deepest subatomic secrets, irradiate cancerous tumors, and generate powerful x-rays that measure the structure of molecules essential to life. Nearly all of the world’s 30,000 particle accelerators, which serve industry, hospitals and discovery science, are based on radio-frequency technology developed in the 1930s. The escalating cost of scaling this technology to meet today’s industrial and scientific needs is now prompting a worldwide search for new concepts for accelerating particles to high energy more cheaply, and with smaller machines, than conventional approaches. Accelerators based on pliable, microscopic structures made of ionized gas, or “plasma”, have emerged as promising candidates. Recently several laboratories, including the PI’s, have accelerated electrons to several giga-electron-volts (GeV) in a laser-driven plasma cell only a few inches long, a task that requires a conventional accelerator a third-of-a-mile-long. Nevertheless it remains a challenge for tabletop plasma accelerators to produce electron bunches with the consistent single energy, the reproducible well-defined shape, and the low divergence that practical applications demand. To address this challenge, this project is developing new optical methods to diagnose these key electron bunch properties, and to control the plasma-based accelerators that produce them. The diagnostic methods will reconstruct the 3-dimensional shape and internal energy distribution of electron bunches by analyzing visible and x-ray radiation that they emit on interacting with metal films thinner than a human hair. The control methods aim to improve and stabilize the electron bunch’s properties by using auxiliary laser pulses to manipulate accelerating electrons and to generate a plasma channel that guides the accelerator’s propagation. Experiments are being carried out at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin and at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) in Germany, in close collaboration with laser-plasma simulation experts. The research plan consists of two interwoven activities: 1. Advanced diagnostics of plasma electron accelerators. The extremely short duration and micrometer transverse size of plasma-accelerated electron bunches demand diagnostics beyond those needed for conventional accelerators. The goals are: (i) to measure the complete structure of plasma-accelerated electron bunches in one shot; (ii) to characterize the spectrum of inverse Compton x-rays from laser-plasma accelerators compactly and at low cost, while developing new applications for these x-rays. The methods and facilities to achieve these goals will be, respectively: (a) to capture multi-color images of coherent optical transition radiation that electron bunches generate upon passing through a thin metal film, and to reconstruct the electron bunch from these images using an iterative algorithm (HZDR); (b) to reconstruct the spectra of MeV inverse Compton x-rays from particle cascades that they generate in a custom-designed, inexpensive calorimeter stack, and to use inverse Compton x-rays to measure internal structure of hard materials (e.g. concrete, bones) by x-ray acoustic tomography (UT). 2. Optical control of laser-plasma accelerators. We will explore new optical methods to control the performance of laser-plasma accelerators actively. The goals are: (iii) to increase electron energy beyond the standard dephasing limit; (iv) to overcome diffraction limits to single-stage, multi-GeV laser-plasma accelerators, which must operate in plasmas of much lower electron density (~ 1% of atmospheric density) than previous generation plasma accelerators. The method and facility to achieve these goals will be, respectively: (c) to introduce a “control” laser pulse that transversely modulates electrons that are accelerating within a laser-driven plasma wake, in order to delay their drift into the wake’s decelerating phase (HZDR); (d) to generate and characterize plasma waveguides in helium plasma by optical field ionization, a method well-suited to low-density plasmas (UT). Potential impacts of the project are new insight into optimizing and controlling the properties of electron bunches from plasma accelerators, and development of a bright, compact source of coherent X-rays with new applications. Diagnostic and control techniques developed here will be applicable to a wide cross section of advanced accelerator science. Proposed funds will support several graduate students, including a woman and an under-represented minority. They will also promote an international collaboration between a US and German laboratory."

Harlingen, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Co-Investigator) Alex Levchenko, University of Wisconsin-Madison (Co-Investigator) The most important practical applications of superconductors and many studies of their fundamental properties rely on interfaces with other materials. This project focuses on interfaces and devices made from superconductors and topological insulators; these materials are insulating in terms of their bulk transport characteristics but possess conducting surface states that have very special properties encoded by locking between electron momentum and spin. Specific structures made from these materials via the mutual proximity effect can cause the formation of elusive excitations known as Majorana fermions (MF), which in contrast to ordinary Fermi and Bose particles have so-called anionic exchanges statistics that protect information encoded in them. Thus quantum circuits harboring these excitations potentially allow for quantum information processing in a protected way that enables error-free quantum computing. The experiments to be performed will create and detect Majorana fermions in superconductor/topological insulator structures and devices. Advanced cryogenic scanning probe methods will be developed to detect and image them based on their unique magnetic and electronic signatures. Specifically, advancements will be made for three closely-related experiments: (1) Probing Majorana states in Josephson-junction devices; (2) Electronic and magnetic imaging of Majorana fermions; and (3) Development of Scanning Majorana Microscopy. For experiments (1) and (2), cryogenic Scanning Charge Accumulation Imaging, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Scanning SQUID Microscopy will be applied to measure the local signatures of MF states in topological-superconductor proximity systems, including in the barrier of topological insulator Josephson junctions. In conjunction with experiments, a comprehensive analytical approach based on the scattering circuit theory and semi-classical methods of superconductivity to model Andreev and Majorana tunneling density of state and conductance spectra will be developed. With regard to experiment (3), the development of Scanning Majorana Microscopy, the most obvious way detect MF states is to probe for the emergence of the zero-energy resonances. However, the main challenges of such experiments are to exclude the other false-positive contributions to zero-energy peaks that are ubiquitous in condensed matter systems. Theoretical calculations will be applied to predict unique signatures in the counting statistics for electrons entering quantum dots and if the quantum dot electronic states are hybridized with nearby MF states. Based on insights derived, a new scanning probe microscope will be developed and used to probe for the signatures of Majorana states."

In carbon storage operations, reliable characterization of the in-situ stress state in the complex storage reservoirs and the cap rock formations is critical for safe storage of CO2 and minimizing potential environmental hazards related to fluid leakage and induced seismicity. Also, the integrity of the borehole is directly dependent on the stresses profile along the well trajectory and appropriate design of the drilling and stimulation operations. In-situ stresses are notoriously difficult to determine. Several methodologies have been used to date to estimate in-situ stresses. Seismic-based methods offer the advantage of covering a larger volume of subsurface formations, but do not provide sufficient vertical resolution for the required subsurface characterization, especially for carbon storage purposes. Log-based methods that are commonly used for stress estimation rely on the use of costly well logs such as image, density, porosity, sonic etc., together with oversimplified models or correlations to estimate stresses. Another drawback is the typical absence of the required logs (e.g., dipole sonic) and the lack of them outside the pay zones. Logs are also rarely available in unconventional horizontal wells, where the lateral changes in the state of stress is crucial to optimize the stimulation design. These limitations and shortcomings identify an essential requirement for new methodologies and sources of data for stress evaluations, which provide full coverage of the well length at a higher resolution. This project investigates the use of downhole drilling dynamic data together with advanced signal processing, data analytics and machine learning techniques to calculate subsurface in-situ stresses along vertical, deviated, or horizontal wells in real-time. The promising results of the Phase I study successfully proved the concept behind the proposed technology. We found the frequency band of the signals carry information about the stress field and used it to generate reasonably accurate 1-D profiles of the principal in-situ stresses. Building on our findings in Phase I, our main objectives for the Phase II are: (i) validating the findings over a wider range of data acquired in different rock types, bit types and well trajectories, (ii) exploring alternative signal processing approaches, (iii) extending the model to estimate rock mechanical properties as well, (iv) upgrading the machine learning regressor model to deep neural network, and (v) developing and commercializing a software platform hosting this technology."

The sensitivity of conventional photoconductive terahertz detectors is limited due to the trade-off between ultrafast operation and quantum efficiency, which restricts the number of photogenerated carriers that can efficiently contribute to terahertz detection. Another problem of conventional photoconductive terahertz detectors is the necessity of an extremely precise optical alignment. This tight optical alignment requirement also prevents researchers from realizing terahertz detector arrays since it is very challenging to align the optical beam on multiple detectors simultaneously. As a result, conventional THz-TDS systems use single-pixel detectors and raster scanning to capture the image/spectrum of an object, which requires significantly long measurement times. To address all of the limitations of conventional photoconductive terahertz detectors, Lookin, Inc. proposes to develop terahertz focal plane arrays (THz-FPAs) that offer large field-of-view and high-sensitivity operation. The company plans to build two different THz-FPAs; (1) a one-dimensional THz-FPA consisting of 1024 pixels for line scanning, (2) a 256×256 THz-FPA for two-dimensional scanning. To realize these products and demonstrate their capabilities, Lookin, Inc. will adapt new nanofabrication techniques, design read-out circuits/boards, and take terahertz images of various objects with the fabricated THz-FPA prototypes at high scan speeds. Lookin, Inc. will also develop a software that can process the output of the FPA pixels in real time to generate terahertz images and videos. The building block of the proposed THz-FPAs will be the high-performance photoconductive terahertz detector, which was developed by Lookin during the Phase I SBIR program. The detector uses an array of photoconductive nanoantennas integrated with a plasmonic nanocavity, which is specifically designed to increase the optical absorption around the nanoantennas. This approach enabled boosting the efficiency of photoconductive terahertz detectors by three orders of magnitude. As a result, high-SNR THz-TDS operation was achieved even at very low optical pump power levels. In addition, by using nanoantenna arrays and distributing them over a large area, Lookin’s detector requires a much less demanding optical alignment compared to conventional photoconductive detectors. The area of this novel detector based on nanoantenna arrays can be easily scalable to build multi-pixel terahertz detector arrays. Broadband THz-FPAs with high sensitivity and high efficiency would revolutionize the terahertz technology market by addressing the most crucial needs of practical THz-TDS systems. They not only improve the performance of THz-TDS systems in their current applications, but they also enable new applications. Such THz-FPAs would transform THz-TDS systems from a metrology tool with a slow scan speed and limited field-of-view to a high-throughput instrument that can be used in industrial settings for various quality control applications."

On Earth, PAH are largely produced in incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and are considered as critical precursors to unwanted soot particles leading to combustion inefficiency and causing air pollution along with detrimental health effects. Simple PAH molecules, such as naphthalene, indene, phenanthrene, pyrene, initially formed in the gas phase, are further involved in a build-up process in combustion flames leading to larger PAH, fullerenes, bowl-shaped nanostructures and solid-phase species including carbonaceous dust, graphene particles, and soot. In deep space, with up to 20% of the galactic carbon budget suggested to be locked in PAH-like molecules, PAH and their offshoots are potential key intermediates and nucleation sites leading eventually to carbonaceous nanoparticles (“interstellar grains”). Therefore, the understanding of the key processes in the synthesis of PAHs along with their precursors and their degradation mechanisms in combustion systems and in interstellar, circumstellar, and planetary atmospheric environments will provide critical insights into how complex aromatic structures and possibly graphenes and fullerenes are formed and destroyed. Achieving this understanding is an important step in the development of the efficient combustion processes and of the ecofriendly devices with reduced environmental pollution. Also, the understanding of the key processes of PAHs growth will help in our comprehension of chemical evolution in the universe. Detailed information on the mechanisms and reliable rate constants of the key elementary chemical reactions involved in PAH formation and destruction processes is often missing, with the main deficiencies being the absence of temperature- and pressure-dependent rate constants for the broad range of conditions occurring in various combustion processes and the lack of data on the reaction products and their branching ratios. Complementary to experimental studies, these gaps in knowledge can be filled by using quantum chemical calculations of reaction potential energy surfaces providing us with accurate energies of reaction products, intermediates, and transition states, revealing the reaction mechanism, and giving the molecular properties required to compute rate constants for relevant reaction steps and product branching ratios using the RRKM-Master Equation (ME) method. In the new three-year project period we will employ this ab initio/RRKM-ME approach to study key reaction relevant to the formation/growth and oxidative destruction/degradation of PAH, and to soot nucleation, which have taken the center stage in the present quest by the combustion-research community. We will focus on the following systems: 1) reactions forming large multi-ring PAH including complete pathways to coronene and coranullene from the smallest prototype PAH naphthalene and indene; 2) comprehensive oxidation mechanism of the first aromatic ring and its extension to an aromatic ring within PAH; 3) chemical dimerization of PAH with the formation of E-bridged PAH structures playing a critical role in soot nucleation. The information derived from our theoretical calculations will contribute to a better fundamental understanding of mechanisms of chemical reactions in combustion and astrochemistry, provide missing critical data for the current kinetic models, and improve flame models of hydrocarbon fuels and astrochemical models of the growth of carbonaceous molecules and particles in cold molecular clouds, circumstellar envelopes and planetary atmospheres."

Our system enables low pressure drop, high volumetric utilization and high mass transfer, and is suitable for the rapid heat transfer and low temperature swing regeneration operating modes needed for cost-effective carbon capture. Capital and operating costs are reduced based on lowered energy demand. Our approach to regenerable CO2 capture eliminates 75% of the energy cost required for operation of methylethanolamine (MEA) based systems. In Phase II this approach has been demonstrated at the laboratory level and will be further tested at the National Carbon Capture Center with live flue gas from a 900 MW coal-fired power plant. Our work also included an economic model for integration with a coal-fired power plant that demonstrated our approach can meet the DOE cost- goals related to effective carbon-capture. Our primary benefit will be a new technology for substantially reducing the cost of CO2 capture, offering energy savings and economic advantage to industries that may need to reduce carbon emissions. Worldwide, carbon emissions are forecasted to grow dramatically, with fossil fuel combustion and industry accounting for substantial CO2 emissions and with competing industries and economies worldwide seeking to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon capture technologies provide a path to reduce net carbon emissions while also supplying CO2 for integration with value-added chains of several industries, including enhanced oil recovery and an emerging industry of converting CO2 to value added chemicals such as fuels and plastics. Technologies that capture CO2 emissions at lower cost offer potential for American global economic advantage and energy independence, both for domestic industries that save energy using the technology and as the basis for export products that deliver the technology to others. Phase IIA work will build on the Phase II success to further develop and optimize our sorbent and substrate properties, demonstrate performance and durability testing with coal-derived flue gas, and produce a refined techno-economic analysis model based on CFD and process modeling and a fully integrated economic analysis including balance of plant components. Our product’s essential value proposition is that it enables lower cost post-combustion carbon capture, with potential for further cost reductions with further technology development, experience and scale. The critical need it will fulfill is to provide carbon capture at lower cost than other technologies, offering energy savings and economic advantage to industries and plants that need to actually remove carbon emissions from their post-combustion exhaust."
Physics at the Cosmic Frontier: Direct Detection of Dark Matter with SuperCDMS,Office of High Energy Physics,DE-SC0012294,"Cushman, Priscilla",Priscilla.Cushman@regentsoftheuniversityofminnesota,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","Physics at the Cosmic Frontier: Direct Detection of Dark Matter with SuperCDMS Professor Priscilla Cushman, Principle Investigator Professor Vuk Mandic, Co-PI The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) looks for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). WIMPs are the most likely explanation for the dark matter that makes up 80% of the mass in our Universe, as demonstrated by motions of stars and galaxies, the cosmic microwave background, and large scale structure. However, a dark matter particle has never been detected in a terrestrial experiment. Understanding the nature of dark matter, measuring its mass, and determining its distribution in the Universe is a primary goal for particle physics over the next decade. CDMS will provide a crucial part of the puzzle. The CDMS detectors are germanium and silicon crystals about the size of a hockey puck, which are cooled to 40 milli-degrees above absolute zero. At this temperature, heating caused by WIMP interactions can be read out by the thousands of tungsten thermometers (called transition edge sensors) which coat the top and bottom surfaces of the detector. Our detectors come in two formats. The iZIP detectors (standing for interleaved Z-sensitive Ionization and Phonon ) can determine the position of the interaction (depth Z, as well as X and Y), the vibration caused by the bumped nucleus (Phonon) and the charge released by the interaction (Ionization). It is the signature advantage of CDMS technology that by comparing the phonon and ionization signals, background rejection of better than one in a million can be achieved. In addition, we have pioneered a new form of our detector which is operated at high voltage (HV detector). These detectors can search for WIMPs with very low mass since the high voltage lowers our energy threshold, making us sensitive to even smaller energy depositions. CDMS consists of three stages, each experiment with a larger and more advanced detector design. This proposal outlines the work that the University of Minnesota will do to ensure the success of all three stages. The first experiment to run underground at the Soudan Lab in northern Minnesota was called CDMS-II. Dark matter experiments must run underground in order to escape the confusing flux of cosmic rays. It held the lead in WIMP sensitivity for more than a decade. The CDMS-II data also provided new limits on axions, inelastic dark matter, and annual modulation, as well as a refined energy scale for nuclear recoils in solid state crystals. The Minnesota group has played major roles in all these analysis efforts and still uses the legacy data for specialized jobs, such as benchmarking the Geant4 simulation and refining the nuclear recoil scale in silicon. The next stage, called SuperCDMS-Soudan, ran from 2011-2015. It deployed larger iZIP germanium detectors within the old CDMS-II cryostat at Soudan. The Minnesota cryogenic lab was one of the two SuperCDMS facilities that evaluated these improved detectors and identified the optimal Soudan detector payload. Data acquired by SuperCDMS-Soudan gave world-leading results in its first data set, including a demonstration of three orders of magnitude better electron recoil background rejection with iZIP detectors, a blind analysis of new low threshold data, and an ultra-low threshold running mode at high voltage, called CDMSlite. Minnesota was the main analysis center for CDMSlite and wrote the paper that provided unsurpassed sensitivity at very low WIMP masses. We continue to be the lead institution modeling and simulating background sources at low energies for the HV detectors which are the successors to CDMSlite and developing calibration schemes. Analysis of the third and final run of CDMSlite is led by a Minnesota graduate student and will include a novel salting scheme to remove human bias, combined with a new likelihood analysis technique. The third stage, called SuperCDMS-SNOLAB, is in the process of installing larger iZIPs and the new HV detectors in a shield and cryostat at the deeper SNOLAB site in Sudbury, Canada. These changes will ensure an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to WIMPs. A co-located underground test facility called CUTE is already taking data using SuperCDMS R&D detectors and our students are analyzing these very low threshold devices (called HVeV and PD2). The Minnesota cryogenic lab is using early versions of the SNOLAB detectors to develop new algorithms for optimal analysis of data from these information-rich detectors. A new in-situ source driver can remotely position a radioactive source anywhere on the surface of the detector to create data sets that will allow us to understand the complicated phonon and charge transport physics within the detector. With that data we can develop the detector simulation tools needed to model our signals and discriminate them from background. This data is also part of an interdisciplinary study on machine learning (together with data from CMS and proto-DUNE) that will boost our pattern recognition analysis. Other on-going efforts include designing new cold hardware, screening of shielding and tower materials using our high purity germanium detector, shield and neutron veto design, background estimates in the new environment, and a new data acquisition system. The Minnesota cryogenic lab also supports integration of different subsystems (detectors, cold and warm electronics, MIDAS data acquisition) into a well-functioning system."

Matter under such extreme conditions resembles the early universe when the nuclear strong force confined fundamental and nearly massless particles, quarks and gluons, into massive nucleons (protons and neutrons), which are the building blocks of all matter around us. Although in principle, the strong force is well described as a quantum field theory, Quantum Chromo Dynamics or QCD, in practice the dynamics that led to the creation of nucleons remains largely a mystery. Studying the QGP and its transition to regular matter in the laboratory holds the promise to better understand how the strong force confined quarks and gluons into nucleons. The PI’s Drees and Hemmick use collisions of heavy ions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to create droplets of QGP and study its properties. Their approach is twofold. For one, they are engaged in the construction of sPHENIX experiment, a new state-of-the-art detector to study the QGP that will fully exploit the capabilities of the upgraded RHIC facility at BNL. Here they lead the construction, installation, and commissioning of the TPC particle tracking system for seamless first data taking in 2023. In addition, they focus on the completion of the mission of the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. PHENIX terminated data taking in 2016, but extensive data sets recorded by PHENIX from 2014 to 2016 as well as others with unique colliding systems or energies remain to be fully analyzed. Particular emphasis is on measuring the temperature of the QGP and unraveling its time evolution using thermal radiation emitted during the collisions. The research and development work on this project will also directlybenefit the first generation detector for a future electron-ion collider, the next big construction project considered by the DOE."
Carbonate Management to Enable Energy- and Carbon-Efficient CO2 Electrolysis,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0021634,"Surendranath, Yogesh",Yogesh.Surendranath@massachusettsinstituteoftechnology,"['material', 'phase', 'high', 'energy', 'technology', 'approach', 'research', 'system']","The rapid growth and plummeting cost of solar energy have created great interest in using CO2 electrolysis to produce chemical feedstocks and fuels such as carbon monoxide, ethylene, ethanol, and propanol. While research in CO2 electrolysis has yielded substantial progress in both fundamental understanding of the requisite electrocatalytic reactions and design of prototype devices, the energy efficiency (electrical energy-to-product) and carbon efficiency (CO2-to-product) of CO2 electrolysis remain far too low for large-scale deployment. A preponderance of evidence indicates that the principal reason for these low efficiencies is the rapid and thermodynamically favorable reaction of CO2 with hydroxide (OH–) to form carbonate (CO32–), which forces CO2 electrolysis cells to operate under conditions that result in large voltage and CO2 losses. This “CO32– problem” presents a fundamental scientific barrier to creating a viable electrochemical option for converting solar energy into chemicals and fuels. The objective of this collaborative research project is to establish a fundamental science of CO32– management in CO2 electrolysis and advance new strategies for mitigating the voltage and CO2 losses that result from the “CO32– problem”. The research will aim to develop new catalysts and electrolytes featuring microenvironments tailor-made to minimize CO32– formation and facilitate its rapid release, while also minimizing voltage losses in the cell. The target outcome for the project is to demonstrate viable approaches for addressing the CO32– problem and establish a roadmap towards high efficiency CO2 electrolysis. The CO32– problem provides an ideal use-inspired testbed for addressing long-standing knowledge gaps in fundamental solar energy conversion and catalysis science. Understanding how to manage CO32– fluxes across all cell components will reveal the design principles for using microenvironments to control interfacial catalysis and ion transport. Thus, in addition to addressing a central impediment to CO2-to-fuel catalysis, the proposed work is poised to establish a foundational basic science of CO32– management with wide-ranging implications for diverse energy technologies including air batteries, fuel cells, electrochemical CO2 concentrators, and alkaline water electrolysis devices."

When pipeline infrastructure is not available, the gas is either compressed or liquefied for storage and transport or flared. Often distribution of remote natural gas or use of it for power production cannot be economically justified. This type of gas reserve is typically considered as stranded natural gas and represents billions of dollars in unutilized assets. One approach to utilize these gases is to convert them to high energy density liquid hydrocarbons. A compact GTL process can be deployed at the well head but must overcome product yield and economic issues related to use of extremely small-scale processing equipment. Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) addresses these issues through development of high yield processing technology taking advantage of novel catalysts for the conversion of ethane into intermediates, which are then upgrading to liquid transportation fuels. Phase I showed highest reported to date performance for GTL-intermediate catalyst, enabling a lower energy pathway to olefins and a corresponding lower cost path to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. PCI showed that the GTL reactor and catalysts enables product yields higher than any previously reported, 64% vs. 40%, minimizes side reactions, and enables economically viable production of liquid transportation fuels for small, 1 MMSCF/day natural gas wells (w/10% ethane) to potentially very large installations. PCI shows that a ~35% reduction in energy consumption for ethylene production alone is possible by shifting manufacturing from the industrially important but highly endothermic ethane steam cracking to our novel exothermic process. Phase II will further optimize the reactor and catalyst for yields and costs needed to reach $3/gallon gasoline target, using a combination of experimental studies, reaction rate, reactor, and process modeling, and techno-economic assessments. The process is applicable to remote, stranded or excess natural gas, as well for GTL applications, as well as to facilities looking to reduce costs of olefin manufacturing."

Molten salts enable more economic operation due to higher temperatures (>600°C), thermal energy storage, and ability to dissolve fuel in the coolant. Coolants require the development of new corrosion resistant materials that meet or supersede existing standard codes for these systems. Reactors require validation and testing of material systems that produce robust component structures enabling them to withstand corrosive environments. The Phase I/II objective is to develop and demonstrate a scalable, low-cost nuclear reactor bimetallic overlay electrodeposition process that can improve the lifetime and durability of molten salt reactor components. State-of-the-art overlays and diffusion bond processes based on a scalable approach will further improve corrosion resistance to high temperature operation. Demonstrated efficacy of a manufacturing process for overlay deposition onto certified materials for improved lifetime and durability of molten fluoride salt reactor components by: developing electrodeposition conditions to apply nickel-molybdenum overlays; performing diffusion bonding of the overlay to substrate via hot isostatic pressing; 500 hour molten fluoride salt corrosion trials at 700°C; preparing a preliminary economic analysis. Studies showed: ability to grade overlays; hot isostatic pressing of overlay without delamination or debonding; reduced mass loss during molten fluoride salt corrosion trial by over 80%; reduced substrate intergranular attack; estimated cost for overlay on 3-ft 316H pipe of $92 compared to $146.39 for Hastelloy N. Optimize control of bimetallic nickel-molybdenum overlay application (electrodeposition, diffusion bonding) process to improve overlay microstructure and achieve lower mass loss and less intergranular attack during static and continuously flowing molten fluoride salt reactor trials. Process scaling-optimization will provide understanding required to apply overlays onto the internal pipe diameter enabling simulated molten salt reactor heat exchanger trials. Phase II will establish the potential commercial readiness of the overlay and down-selected /optimized the parameters required to improve the lifetime and durability during molten salt reactor operation. This approach could be used to apply low cost high value corrosion resistant overlays to a wide range of substrates for pre-use and repair applications within the high temperature corrosion community. This not only includes nuclear reactors but concentrated solar cell systems, supercritical carbon dioxide systems, and many others."

Therefore, methods that generate such structural models are highly significant to research and development efforts in industrial and governmental laboratories. Cryo-electron microscopy single particle reconstruction (cryo-EM SPR) is a powerful technique that can generate highly accurate structural models. In cryo-EM SPR, features of micrographs are analyzed and classified to enable alignment and signal averaging from thousands to millions of particle snapshots – each showing a molecule of interest in a single orientation. Success of a cryo-EM SPR experiment depends on the accuracy of alignment between single images of molecules, and for macromolecules having smaller masses, the amount of information in each snapshot is frequently insufficient for accurate alignment. Our project addresses this major barrier to cryo-EM SPR progress by developing and implementing new and powerful algorithms that use graphical processing units (GPUs) to recover and combine information present in cryo-EM images in the most optimal manner. In Phase I, we developed and implemented algorithms using GPUs that perform the early steps of cryo-EM SPR data analysis – classification and image alignment for macromolecules. Our solutions have definite superior aspects that we plan to leverage in Phase II, where we will incorporate our methods into an integrated software application. Our integrated application will include not only superior algorithmic and numerical approaches, but also elaborate management of a complex hierarchy of calculations, a graphical user interface providing fast, thorough, and informative feedback on project progress. This user-friendly package will be commercially distributed (Phase II and III). We expect that our novel algorithms and new approach to resource management will contribute to cryo-EM SPR’s fast expansion and will enable studies of macromolecules and their complexes that are currently inaccessible to the technique, either due to their size or their structural heterogeneity. These benefits are of high significance for the field, so the potential for successful commercialization is high."

Specifically, the PIs have proposed to elucidate the limits to energy conversion at the molecular scale by tuning the electronic structure of molecular junctions (MJs) and probe non-equilibrium distributions of hot carriers in nanostructured plasmonic systems by leveraging MJs’ unique transport characteristics. In order to experimentally address critical open questions in MJ- based transport, the group has recently developed several novel techniques that enable systematic studies of thermoelectric properties and thermal transport in MJs. Further, their preliminary experiments have also demonstrated that transport measurements across molecular junctions that bridge the plasmonic nanostructure and the tip of a scanning probe can be employed to quantitatively ascertain the distribution of hot carriers. Using these tools and additional approaches to be developed in this work, the investigators will seek to answer the following key questions: Can the electronic structure of MJs be controlled to achieve thermoelectric energy conversion efficiencies at thermodynamic limits? Can phonon quantum interference effects strongly influence the heat transport properties of MJs? What are the non-equilibrium distributions of hot carriers in plasmonic nanostructures? These studies will provide novel insights into reversible and irreversible charge and energy transport processes in nanoscale devices and non-equilibrium carrier distributions. Such insights will help advance nanoscale control of energy conversion and are, in the long term, key to the creation of novel, cost-efficient energy conversion devices, where nanoscale processes play a key role.

Of the different encoding methods, time-bin encoding is both common and advantageous for quantum networks, however, scaling time-bin-based quantum networks poses two key challenges. First, these networks require identical phase-locked delay lines within each networking node to handle the time- encoded quantum information. Increasing time-bin count requires more delays that must also be phase locked throughout the network, increasing complexity. Second, combating low rates arising from fiber losses—even with quantum repeaters—requires higher bandwidths. As laying additional fibers to increase bandwidth is cost prohibitive, multiplexing becomes necessary, particularly, spectral multiplexing to utilize the full capacity of fiber. An ideal scalable quantum network should avoid the complexities of delay-line phase locking and exploit multiplexing to increase optical bandwidth. To solve this challenge, this program will develop photonic chip-based time-to-frequency multiplexers to convert time-bin quantum information to frequency-division multiplexed signals within a single time-bin— effectively ‘stacking’ multiple time bins—that will be transmitted efficiently through fiber and demultiplexed using a complimentary chip. To achieve time-to-frequency multiplexing, our chip contains three stages. First, a time-bin combiner uses 1×2 switches and delays to separate and retime the quantum information pulses into one time slot on different physical channels. Next, RF-driven resonators shift the frequency of each channel. Lastly, a series of add/drop filters spectrally combine the channels onto a common bus finishing the time-to-frequency multiplexing. This frequency-stacked quantum information could be further multiplexed using time-division multiplexing on the same chip. In Phase I, we will leverage our ongoing chip-based time-bin entanglement work as well as telecommunications-wavelength frequency shifters to create time-to-frequency multiplexing chips. We will design, fabricate, and evaluate prototype devices to demonstrate this capability, showing both multiplexing and demultiplexing at classical and quantum light. Phase I will target a pair of frequency bins offset by 5 GHz to pave the way for a Phase II effort that will target 8 or more time bins. Our time-to-frequency multiplexing technology will enable multiplexing of quantum-entanglement data over current fiber-based networks, greatly increasing the capacity of near-term quantum networks without the burden of laying additional dedicated fiber. This approach will reduce initial quantum-network infrastructure to expedite some of the first quantum networks. These devices will become a key component for every node within a quantum network, which will enable advanced quantum computing, secure communication, and quantum sensing."

For most next-generation accelerator systems relevant to high energy physics (HEP), the construction cost associated with the RF power system is a substantial driver of the overall cost of the accelerator facility. The cost per peak kilowatt of RF power must be improved by an order of magnitude; one way of achieving this is to develop novel RF amplifier topologies that can take advantage of scalable, mass manufacturing. Since a significant cost driver for high power RF sources is the thermionic cathode, this project seeks to reduce the risk of adoption of CNT field emission cathodes to reduce cost while maintaining or improving overall performance. To achieve this aim, this project takes a three-pronged approach to develop CNT cathodes that will ultimately be demonstrated and characterized in a compact klystron electron gun. First, CNT forest materials will be fabricated by thermal chemical vapor deposition, with attention paid to developing promising forest morphology in processes scalable to large-scale manufacturing. These CNT forest materials will then be rapidly tested in a high voltage diode designed for DC and variable pulsed operation, to fully characterize the cathodes in realistic voltage and vacuum environments and to correlate forest morphology with field emission performance and material resilience. Promising cathode materials will be integrated with a SLAC-designed compact klystron electron gun, modified to accommodate the CNT cathode, enabling characterization of beam uniformity and life testing. These tests will take place at SLAC, on an upgraded facility that will be dedicated to evaluating CNT-based and other novel emitters in the future. By the end of this project, three important outcomes will have been achieved that will significantly reduce the risk of adoption of CNT field emission cathodes in the electron guns of RF sources. The most promising CNT forest morphologies for field emission cathodes, producing the highest peak currents and current densities with the least susceptibility to damage in an electron gun environment, will have been demonstrated. The process parameters resulting in the best combination of cathode resilience, current density, and beam uniformity will have been identified. Finally, the CNT field emission cathodes will have been extensively proven in a compact klystron electron gun under realistic operating conditions, reducing the barriers to adoption of CNT field emission cathodes for RF sources, enabling the next generation of high-power RF amplifiers and HEP accelerators."

The separator facility is based on the ISTF-2 and will be used to develop and test high throughput ion sources to produce high-specific activity radioisotopes for research and therapeutic medical applications. This facility will also be used to train graduate and undergraduate students in the nuclear sciences, chemical, electrical and nuclear engineering, as well as in radiochemistry. Project Description: Reactor- and accelerator-borne radioisotopes will be electromagnetically enriched to yield high specific activity products suitable for research applications. To achieve this goal, the ISTF-2 instrument will be modified to meet the specific requirements of the proposed work and recommissioned at the University of Missouri, where it will be located in close proximity to the MU Research Reactor (MURR) Center. The ISTF-2 instrument is a mass spectrometer that employs a specialized ionization source to produce radioactive ions. The daughter products of enriched metal targets irradiated in the MURR flux trap will be evaporated in a surface ionization source specifically designed for the project and accelerated through the ISTF-2 90&deg; sector magnet with low momentum spread. After exiting the sector magnet, the isotopes from the original target material will separate based on their mass-to-charge ratio; twin carbon foils positioned adjacent to each other and in the path of the ions accumulate the two isotopes with high specificity. Once the accumulation is complete, the carbon foil with the radioactive isotope is pyrolized and the resulting product is made available for research. Similarly, the non-radioactive isotope is pyrolized, however it is to be converted back to metal for re-use in a future experiment. The production goal for the modified ISTF-2 is to recover up to 250 mCi of high specific activity 153Sm over a 12-hour separation period. Potential Impact: The goal of the proposed work is to fulfill an important national need for research-grade radioisotopes of high specific activity identified in a 2015 report produced by the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee. This facility, when co-located with a research reactor such as the MURR, has the potential to produce a wide variety of short lived, high-specific activity lanthanides, including 153Sm, 177Lu, 166Ho, 169Er and 175Yb. With the recent FDA approval of Lutathera (lutetium 177Lu dotatate), this production capacity is particularly important and complements DOE efforts in providing capacity for producing stable and long-lived isotope separation. The successful recommissioning of the ISTF-2 instrument with modifications to efficiently produce high specific activity radioisotopes will avail new and exciting research into emerging therapeutic and diagnostic methods for targeted oncological treatments."

For example, better understanding and predicting contaminant fate and transport in natural and engineered systems obtained from advanced modeling and simulation are crucial for designing cost-effective remediation. In general, the introduction of advanced modeling and simulation practices over the last several decades have proven to produce better products, more quickly, and at a reduced cost. Despite these successes, there are significant barriers to the widespread adoption of these tools. By its dependency on high-performance computing (HPC), advanced modeling and simulation is complicated to use, need in-house expertise, and involves large capital expenditures. Cost is a significant factor, but, to a greater extent, the underlying problem is the complexity required to employ advanced modeling and simulation. It’s this complexity that has made the return on investment, based on the initial and recurring costs, an argument against using advanced modeling and simulation at most small- to medium-sized firms. Many environmental engineering and environmental consulting firms, or other manufacturing and engineering firms with equally complex workflows, cannot afford to contend with the overarching complexity nor deal with the capital outlays. Our proposal intends to simplify advanced modeling and simulation of surface and subsurface science with a turnkey HPC cloud/web-based environment, which leverages ParFlow, to enable the seamless exploration of issues related to water resources without complications. We plan to blend a mixture of existing and new components into a value-added, HPC cloud/web-based environment that leverages our simulate-as-you-go approach to guide end-users through complex HPC workflows for surface and subsurface science. Simple and effective advanced modeling and simulation processes can reduce costs and improve productivity for environmental engineering and environmental consulting firms, and other manufacturing and engineering firms with equally complex workflows."

Because geothermal environments can be extremely corrosive, managing the corrosion of alloys used in geothermal system through a combination of proper alloy selection and operational practices is essential. Unfortunately, materials selection and operational guidance for geothermal systems at present are qualitative and provide mainly lagging indication of performance. The proposed project will develop a fully physics-based model to enable predictive approach to managing corrosion of geothermal systems. The overall objective of Phase 1 is to extend the mixed solvent electrolyte model to model electrochemical kinetics and localized corrosion of alloys and chemistries encountered in geothermal systems. The effect of scale formation on corrosion will be considered. Limited laboratory data will be developed by California Polytechnic Pomona to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. Validation of the model will be performed using existing geothermal corrosion data. In Phase 2, the model will be further extended to include a variety of non-aqueous/mixed solvent systems that may be used in Enhanced Geothermal Systems and additional alloys that may be considered either as monolithic or coating applications. An advisory module will be created to convert the detailed model predictions into implemental action items/recommendations. The model will be incorporated in a cloud platform. Broader benefits of the project will include the ability to model electrochemical kinetics in non-aqueous environments involved in energy storage and metal separation applications."

Various imaging modalities are required to span the complete spatiotemporal landscape for bioenergy and environmental bioimaging needs. The high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, imaging, and sensitivity of new high-purity germanium (HPGe) instruments provide a unique opportunity to complement and enhance these research goals. The HPGe-based Gamma-ray Imager for Plant Research (GIPR) to be developed here will provide non-invasive, in vivo measurements to dynamically track the uptake and distribution of multiple gamma-emitting radioactive elements simultaneously as they move from the soil microbiome into living plants. The hand portable GIPR will utilize commercially available radioisotopes to provide spatial and temporal imaging of plant microelement exchange for the broader scientific community. During Phase I, new gamma-ray imaging hardware and software were developed and evaluated for plant research applications. A weeklong measurement campaign was held at the plant biology laboratories of our University collaborators to assess the viability of two modified imaging systems for dynamic measurements of radioactive elements moving into and within living plants. The results of this campaign were very encouraging, particularly with the coded-aperture imaging modality, and solidified the concept of a prototype GIPR system for the Plant Research community. Phase II will see the manufacture and evolution of several prototype GIPR systems with new advanced gamma-ray imaging modalities to provide vastly improved sensitivity and resolution for Plant Research. These prototype imagers will be used to observe the real-time transport and allocation of important resources in bioenergy- relevant plants and the local microbial community. The Gamma-ray Imager for Plant Research will provide a versatile bioimaging device in a small, portable form factor for the larger scientific community to enable new Plant Science research using commercially available radioisotopes. The technology developed in this project will naturally contribute to other DOE security-related fields including nuclear weapons non-proliferation, treaty verification, nuclear materials holdup, nuclear safeguards, and diagnostics."

Ongoing work is focused in two areas: on the search for signatures of an epoch in the early universe of exponential expansion that could explain many of the observed properties of our universe; and, on the measurement of neutrino mass and searches for other very light particles. In the future, the mm-wave sky may be used to test for whether dark matter interacts with itself and what is the cause of the observed acceleration of cosmic expansion. To exploit this potential, however, detector counts must increase enormously from the 100,000 scale necessary for CMB-S4 to the 1,000,000 scale needed for the potential future CMB-HD project to the 10,000,000 needed for a mm-wave spectroscopic survey. Our DOE-funded effort to develop microstrip-coupled kinetic inductance detectors to meet this need has made excellent progress. This approach can afford the ability to read out of order 1000 detectors on a single pair of wires, an utter necessity for these future projects. With prior funding, we demonstrated high yield of fundamental-noise-limited detectors with very low direct stimulation systematics. The continued funding afforded by this award will enable a full end-to-end demonstration of optical efficiency and requisite sensitivity under typical operating conditions, and we will also develop designs appropriate for spectroscopy."

Unraveling the Mechanisms of Below- And Aboveground Liana-Tree Competition in Tropical Forests,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0020344,"Medvigy, David",David.Medvigy@universityofnotredamedulac,"['model', 'system', 'energy', 'research', 'approach', 'climate', 'community', 'project']","Lianas, or woody vines, are abundant throughout forests worldwide. However, their effect on total forest biomass is puzzling from ecological and biogeochemical perspectives. Lianas are thought to directly contribute much less to total forest biomass than trees because lianas are typically more slender than trees. However, recent experiments have established an indirect effect of lianas on tropical forest biomass. In one case, tropical forest plots were intentionally cleared of lianas; tree growth rates in these cleared plots were monitored for several years, and then compared to tree growth rates in uncleared plots. The results were staggering: tree wood production was 75% greater in plots cleared of lianas than in the uncleared plots. To make this extra wood, the cleared plots absorbed 75% more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than the uncleared plots. The exact reasons for this large indirect effect on biomass are still under debate. A mechanistic, predictive model can, in principle, trace the essential lines of cause-and-effect and explain why lianas so strongly affect forests. Vexingly, however, lianas are not represented at all in current-day models, and so the modeling approach has not yet been leveraged. Indeed, current models cannot address how lianas affect the strength of the intact tropical forest carbon dioxide sink, which has helped buffer the Earth system against changes in climate, nor can they answer why liana infestation has been observed to have increased in intact tropical forests in recent decades. In order for these gaps to be filled and for accurate liana-predicting models to be developed, better knowledge of liana-specific morphology and allocation, both above- and belowground, is required. This project has three overarching objectives related to observations, modeling, and synthesis. Observations: Field measurements will be made in tropical dry forests in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. First, excavations of entire trees and lianas will be carried out to enable measurement of belowground (coarse and fine root) and aboveground (woody stem, branch and leaf) biomass of co-occurring trees and lianas, as will coarse and fine root vertical distribution and lateral spread. Second, liana trait measurements will be made including xylem vessel diameter and length, turgor loss point, hydraulic conductivity, vulnerability to embolism, wood density, and specific leaf area. Third, above- and belowground productivity will be measured, and fine root productivity will be assigned to species using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Fourth, a throughfall exclusion experiment (designed to generate drier-than-usual soils) will be used to distinguish the responses of lianas and trees to drought. Fifth, additional measurements will be carried out in the latter part of the project to reduce model uncertainty and improve model quality. Modeling: Lianas will be incorporated into a mechanistic, individual-based forest dynamics model that includes both trees and lianas. The model will simulate the unique features of lianas, accounting for their structural parasitism and their different (with respect to trees) allocation strategies and morphology. The simulated trees and lianas will compete aboveground for light and belowground for water. Thus, the model will integrate above- and belowground processes and couple the carbon and water cycles. Organism traits measured as part of this project will be used to parameterize the model, and parameter sensitivity will be assessed. Measurements of below- and aboveground productivity and liana colonization and shedding will be used to evaluate the model. Once model biases and trait sensitivities are identified, additional measurements will be planned to further improve model quality. Synthesis: A working group will be established to plan for the incorporation of lianas into Earth system models (ESMs). About 25 participants are anticipated, with expertise thoroughly covering ESMs, modeling, lianas, roots, and tropical ecology. In summary, this project includes tightly coupled, synergistic modeling and measurement campaigns. Novel measurements of liana below- and aboveground allocation, productivity, and function will allow the development of an unprecedented liana-simulating forest dynamics model. By tying the coupled model-measurement approach proposed here to the synthesis working groups, this project will achieve better representation of tropical forests in ESMs is essential for simulating global carbon cycle dynamics. Given the recent increases in liana abundance, inclusion of lianas in ESMs will be necessary to achieve a robust, predictive understanding of coupled biogeochemical processes and cycles. This project will also generate publicly-available (via ESS-DIVE) products, including ecological field measurements, DNA barcodes, model source code, and model simulations."

Burch, Boston College The PI proposes to continue to explore the nonlinear and inelastic optical responses of topological semimetals (TSM), towards understanding their dynamics and unleashing their potential for plasmonics, nonreciprocal photothermoelectrics, high speed interconnects, efficient nonlinear optoelectronic elements, and magneto-resistive sensors. Topological semimetals possess an array of novel transport and nonlinear responses, including ultrahigh mobilities, chiral anomalies, extreme magneto-resistance, and nonlinear responses. These properties’ origins remain controversial, such as whether the nontrivial topology is responsible for the ultrahigh mobility and enormous nonlinearities. In this proposal, the PI will use his unique combination of expertise in optical spectroscopy and device fabrication to uncover the mechanisms governing the dynamic and topological properties of Semimetals. This will require deciphering the intertwined roles of the band dispersion, symmetry, phonons, and quantum geometry. In particular, one must controllably tune one of these components and observe the effects on various physical responses. It is also highly desirable to expand nonlinear techniques to provide more detailed information about the quantum geometry from particular momentum regions of the band structure. To this end, the PI proposes to develop and perform nonlinear photocurrent measurements in magnetic fields, along with new angular resolved, current-induced photocurrents. The scattering and role of phonons will be disentangled through Raman experiments, performed on a series of well-chosen materials, that tune either the Fermi level or phonon spectra. Lastly, the PI will perform these experiments in a magnetic field to uncover what role, if any, the quantum geometry plays in the novel phonon-electron scattering."

MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory, East Lansing, Michigan 48824 The capture and conversion of sunlight into chemical energy by photosynthesis is the basic biological process driving life on earth. Photosynthesis sustainably provides food, feed, and energy-rich molecules, and it has led to the formation of fossil fuels over geological time. An interdisciplinary and diverse team of 11 lead investigators with complementary expertise, as well as talented scientists at all levels, is exploring photosynthetic processes covering the scales of biological organization ranging from photoactive compounds, enzymes, protein complexes, organelles and bacterial micro compartments (BMC), the thylakoid membrane, to the overall integration of photosynthesis in cells and organisms in their environments. The long-term goal of these scientific endeavors is to explore basic mechanisms of energy storage by oxygenic photosynthesis, at scales ranging from primary capture of light energy and carbon fixation to the building and maintenance of the biological solar panels in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. By increasing our mechanistic knowledge of photosynthesis across scales, we will be better poised to not only improve photosynthetic efficiency and productivity, but also develop photosynthetic modules that can be recombined in innovative ways to produce novel photosynthesis-based products. This Project integrates complementary strengths of the participants to allow for cross-disciplinary interactions enabling novel approaches that would not be otherwise possible in individual labs. The three Subprojects are: A. Primary capture, storage and regulation of light energy, and avoidance of deleterious side reactions; B. Integrating energy supply and demand in the biological solar panel; and C. Characterizing, engineering and integrating subcellular and cellular modules for photosynthetic productivity. Subproject A focuses on understanding the photosynthetic mechanisms that effectively balance the needs for efficient light capture, production of the correct forms of energy and the avoidance of damaging side reactions. An integrated model, which explains how light and assimilatory reactions of photosynthesis are coordinated through control of the thylakoid proton motive force, will be tested and expanded over ranges of conditions and species. In particular, the processes that limit the ability to productively use rapidly increased light availability, and the structural factors—especially the thylakoid lipid environment—that allow photosynthesis to operate under extreme conditions, will be investigated using novel spectroscopic methods, together with natural and introduced genetic variations. Under Subproject B, studies of the assembly and turnover of the photosynthetic membrane with a focus on lipids will continue. The mechanisms required of photorespiration in extremophiles and dynamic environmental conditions will be studied, particularly under high light and in response to biotic stress. The carbon supply to photosynthesis will be investigated focusing on stromal carbonic anhydrase and its possible function as an inorganic carbon sensor in stochastic environments. Carbohydrate exchange and partitioning effects on photosynthesis and underlying sensing mechanisms will be further explored with the goal to “raise the roof of photosynthesis”. The integration of photosynthetic fluxes with central metabolism starting with the integration of carbon and electron budgets will be investigated. Under Subproject C, the natural cyanobacterial carboxysome, a BMC allowing CO2 enrichment at the site of photosynthetic carbon fixation, will be explored in detail. The cellular and subcellular environmental tuning of carboxysome morphology and function will be investigated. Building on our increasing knowledge of BMC shell assembly and structure, carboxysome shell permeability for ATP, O2, and electrons will be probed. This will require in vitro assembly of shells and the encapsulation of specific sensor proteins. The role of cyanobacterial rubisco and rubisco activase-like proteins in carboxysomal core regulation, assembly, and function will be further studied. It is anticipated that the diversity of interdisciplinary research conducted under the Subprojects will lead to unique outcomes. Synergy will derive from the exchange of ideas among participants in the Subprojects, and this exchange will be fostered through monthly Subproject meetings to which all are invited, weekly student and postdoc presentations at the PRL Tuesday Noon Seminar, and annual retreats."

The most versatile approach involves the acquisition of intrinsic spectra of molecular ensembles from regions of interest with the sensitivity and discrimination necessary to identify target analytes from within complex cellular environments. To date, all such approaches fail to achieve the ultimate bioimaging goal: dynamic in situ detection and imaging of key metabolic processes in and among living plant and microbial systems, non-destructively and in real-time. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the most powerful non-invasive methods for identification and characterization of molecules. Conventional NMR instruments permit rapid, quantitative, and reproducible discrimination of biomolecules in complex biologic fluids but require large and expensive superconducting magnets to increase signal. Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can “hyperpolarize” nuclear spins at levels that are orders of magnitude greater than thermal polarization allowing operation at lower magnetic fields. Extending the recently discovered optically enabled DNP of 13C in nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy color centers, we aim to develop novel three-dimensional, in-cell, NMR sensors using targeted nanodiamonds (NDs). 13C nuclear spins, abundantly present in the targeting ND particles, will be employed as NMR sensors of the analyte nuclei in cellular and sub-cellular systems. The ND sensors can be brought in close proximity to sample analytes, allowing amplification of the NMR response by optical hyperpolarization of 13C, while simultaneously spatially localizing the NMR signal sources. Sensor hyperpolarization would allow direct 3D radiofrequency readout from NDs located at up to cm-depth. Hyperpolarized 13C diamond nuclei, multiply dipolar-coupled to each other, open a ready pathway to exploit nuclei entanglement, allowing access to large entangled 13C cluster states in ND to be exploited for NMR sensing. This approach will be integrated into a fluorescent microscope and scanning microcoil employed for RF readout of NMR signals to allow correlation to structural features along with direct optical hyperpolarization. Diamond nanoparticles will be functionalized to target cell surfaces for demonstration of detection of metabolic processes in real time in yeast cells."

This conversion to renewable energy sources has accordingly turned the focus of research from renewable energy generation to energy storage. Whereas truly disruptive improvements in energy storage technologies are limited by energy density, fuels possess the energy density needed for large-scale deployment of renewable energy. Indeed, society has intuitively understood this disparity in energy density beginning at the turn of the 20th century, as all large-scale energy storage in our society is in the form of fuels. The first step in driving the historic restructuring of the U.S. energy infrastructure from a carbon fuels base to one that is renewable begins with the solar-driven generation of hydrogen and oxygen from water. The solar-produced hydrogen may be used directly or combined with carbon dioxide to deliver any number of liquid fuels. As light does not directly act on water to engender its splitting into its elemental components, catalysts are needed to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The OER and HER catalysts lie at the nexus of the light and dark chemistries of photoelectrochemical water splitting as it provides the conduit through which the one electron-hole generation attendant to light capture and conversion is aggregated and discharged via the four electron, four-proton OER transformation. OER catalysts integrated to photoabsorbers in the working environment are not crystalline solids and they invariably become amorphous owing to the disorder that develops during catalytic turnover. The objective of the proposed project is to develop tools and methods to study amorphous OER catalysts. The particular class of catalysts that are the target of the proposed studies is metallate oxygen evolving catalysts (M-OECs), which are composed of molecular metallate clusters aggregated in a disordered heterogeneous environment. Research is designed to uncover the chemical principles that underlie the OER mechanism of M-OECs and the role of metal ion dopants in enhancing catalyst activity and stability. Because M-OECs are amorphous, distinctive approaches will be undertaken to overcome the challenges presented by the amorphous environment. As the heterogeneous M-OECs comprise molecular metallate clusters, molecular compounds that are faithful models of the metallate building blocks will be examined to help in the construction of structure-function-activity relationships. A second important element of the program is the enhanced utilization of major DOE facilities at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The Advanced Photon Source at ANL will be used to characterize the structural and electronic properties of amorphous M-OECs by undertaking measurements of high energy X-ray scattering for Pair Distribution Function analysis and for metal edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy analysis. A final important element of the project’s workplan is to combine electrochemistry and photochemistry to define the OER mechanisms of M-OECs that are associated with equilibrium and non-equilibrium processes, respectively. By combining these different elements, the potential impact of the proposed DOE project is to provide the community with atomistic details of structure-function-activity relationships of amorphous catalysts. Such an atomistic level of understanding of an amorphous catalyst system is unusual and thus the approaches and methods developed in this project should be useful to other researchers targeting the development of next-generation catalysts in a working OER environment."

Aizenberg, Harvard University (Principal Investigator) A. Balazs, University of Pittsburgh (Co-Investigator) Living organisms have the ability to grow by taking in nutrients and thus, continue to increase in size and change shape. While various methods have been developed to create new stimuli-responsive polymeric materials that can swell, change geometry or physical properties, these materials ultimately return to their initial size and shape. The development of novel materials that can be programmed to expand on-demand to larger sizes and various actuatable and morphing shapes would transform manufacturing processes, providing new methods that capitalize on the remarkable growth abilities of living organisms. Inspired by growth in biological systems, we will design a new type of growing synthetic polymer material that encompasses “living” chain ends and can continually incorporate nutrient, i.e., monomer and cross-linker. The interactions between the reactive chain ends and “nutrients” enable the material to either grow in a controllable isotropic or anisotropic manner into programmable shapes and sizes, or self-destruct. Moreover, we propose to incorporate modular, environment-responsive units into the network of the growing polymeric materials. The objectives of these studies are well aligned with the mission of the Basic Energy Sciences (BES) program: 1) to support fundamental research to understand, predict, and control matter and energy to provide the foundations for new energy technologies and 2) advance fundamental experimental and theoretical research to provide the knowledge base for the discovery and design of new materials with novel structures, functions, and properties. In order to carry out such fundamental studies, we will take advantage of the extensive expertise of Aizenberg (Harvard University) in the development of new adaptive materials coupled with computational models devised by Balazs (University of Pittsburgh) and supported by advanced materials characterization capabilities available at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Together we will pursue the following research objectives: - We will develop synthetic routes to a new family of “self-growing” polymers that permit simultaneous and unprecedented levels of control over the mechanical properties, size and shape of the growing sample; - We will build a theoretical model that captures key features of the growth modes observed experimentally and predicts the effects of varying key experimental parameters; - We will design and introduce into our system, in a modular fashion, various components that respond to environmental stimuli, thus endowing the resulting materials with a variety of energy transduction modalities, encoded morphologies and deformabilities, as well as responsiveness to temperature and light; - We will close the loop by further developing our computational modeling tools, in order to be able to predict the behavior of environment-responsive growing polymers to external stimuli and thereby guide the synthetic effort along fruitful paths, not yet explored experimentally. This highly integrated fundamental research program will provide much-needed insight into physicochemical factors and energy-transduction mechanisms that control the behavior of new-generation active and adaptive materials systems. It will also open up applications in the areas of programmable morphing of life-like materials, capable of both growth and self-destruction, self-regulated light–material interactions, as well as microfabrication, advanced additive manufacturing, and soft robotics. The proposed research encompasses several innovative concepts that can lead to the emergence of a new class of bioinspired materials systems, which mimic organisms’ ability to absorb nutrients and grow into predetermined shapes, to respond to environmental stimuli, such as temperature and light, either in an encoded or self-regulation mode. The modeling and simulation approaches that we will develop will both capture the essential features of the experimentally created systems and motivate synthesis and characterization of new materials that will permit multiple modes of actuation necessary for executing complicated dynamic actions. This vital new area of research spans many disciplines that are of fundamental importance for the DoE and energy technologies. An especially unique aspect of this work is its modularity: the systems we will develop provide a toolbox for manipulating material’s growth and decomposition, its morphology and deformability modes, and responsiveness to external stimuli. It will expand the boundaries of the field of adaptive and responsive energy-transducing smart materials into the yet unexplored realm of polymeric materials systems capable of either growth into desired sizes and shapes or on-demand self-destruction. This research program is well aligned with the grand challenges and the mission of the Biomolecular Materials Division of DOE BES because we will be performing “fundamental research in the discovery, design and synthesis of functional materials and complex structures, and materials aspects of energy conversion processes based on principles and concepts of biology”. We fully expect that the development and study of the proposed complex, modular bioinspired systems will provide the knowledge base for discovering, designing, and synthesizing unconventional material systems “with totally new properties for next-generation energy technologies”."

CABBI will conduct innovative research in feedstock development, conversion, and sustainability that integrates recent advances in genomics, synthetic biology, and computational biology to increase the value of biomass crops. The Center represents a transformative research model designed to accelerate bioproduct development while retaining the flexibility to assimilate new disruptive technologies. CABBI is founded on the &ldquo;plants-as-factories&rdquo; paradigm, in which biofuels, bioproducts, high-value molecules, and foundation molecules for conversion are synthesized directly in plant stems. This plants-as-factories approach circumvents the challenges of developing efficient lignocellulose deconstruction methods, while still retaining residual biomass for deconstruction by traditional or emerging methods. CABBI will focus on sorghum, energycane, and Miscanthus, which are high-yielding throughout the rain-fed eastern U.S., including on marginal soils. Foundation molecules from feedstocks will be efficiently converted to diverse, high-value molecules such as biodiesel, organic acids, jet fuels, lubricants, and alcohols using technologies developed in a versatile and automated biofoundry for rapidly engineering microbial strains. Using the design-build-test-learn framework, CABBI research will overcome the challenges associated with driving biological systems to produce non-naturally occurring compounds. The Center will employ a data-driven and integrated modeling framework to develop predictive capability on which feedstock combinations, regions and land types, market conditions, and bioproducts have the potential to support the ecologically and economically sustainable displacement of fossil fuels. Key areas of emphasis will be to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the plant, soil, microbe, and climate interactions that underlie the productivity and ecosystem services of different feedstocks, and on investigating the technological and economic pathways to a sustainable and resilient bioeconomy. This work will result in an overarching framework for viewing the research through an environmental and economic lens - and for designing a closed-loop and integrated program for CABBI."

The goal for this program is to develop new bimetallic structures for radio frequency devices and polymers for gate valves that survive krad levels of radiation over a 2-year period. The objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate advanced, cost-effective, high radiation tolerant bimetallic materials and polymers through additive and scalable manufacturing methods. The proposed innovations for this program involve a novel metal forming technique to eliminate beam welds via binder jet printing and the reactive extrusion of rad hard polymers for peripheral components. In Phase I, a novel technique for binder jet printing will be used with an ExOne system to yield new bimetallic coupons for a radiation exposure study. An innovative approach shall be used during the depowdering and hydrogen sintering steps in the bimetallic structure process to achieve high densities close to that of bulk metals to reach a Technology Readiness Level 4. Additionally, new radiation tolerant polymers for use within metallic gate valve housings shall be produced via reactive extrusion to replace o-rings that currently degrade through radiation induced brittle failure. Mechanical properties of the new bimetallic radio frequency structures and gate valve polymers shall be tested before and after irradiation for a benchmark study to reach TRL 5. Three dimensional bimetallic structures and polymer o-rings would be formed as part of the manufacturing feasibility plan. A strategy to reach Technology Readiness Level 7 in Phase II shall be established with integration partners to ultimately integrate the gate valves within a particle accelerator at a national laboratory. The bimetallic structures formed via binder jet printing offer the potential for significant cost reductions by simplifying cavity dumbbells and end groups and may eliminate the need for electron beam welds. The rad hard polymer o-rings would be used in peripheral components for superconducting structures, such as gate valves, as discussed with members of the accelerator community."

So, it’s no surprise that hydrocarbon extraction processes in the US often produce some waste materials that contain some level of these metals of interest. Both the rapidity and the extent of the U.S. natural gas drilling boom have brought heightened scrutiny to the issues of produced waters containing radioactive materials and/or metals of strategic importance, and there are particular concerns regarding their waste management. For example, produced waters (PW) from the Marcellus Shale hydraulic fracturing operations have shown high uranium content. Fortunately, the risk of this contamination posed to employees or the general public from the NORM is widely held to be minimal. Uranium is considered a “critical mineral” by the US DOE and is an active area of research in the Critical Minerals Sustainability (CMS) program. As are the 17 REEs (La through Lu plus Y and Sc) due to their importance in military, high-tech, and green-tech applications. Recent volatility in global trade has renewed efforts to challenge China’s dominance for both uranium and REEs by establishing a domestic supply and the associated processing facilities. GlycoSurf proposes to focus on the recovery of both uranium and REEs from PWs generated from fracking operations and is collaborating with Pilot Chemical to extract value from PW. GlycoSurf has identified a class of glycolipid molecules, known as rhamnolipids, which exhibit high capture efficiency and selectivity for both uranium and REE, even in the presence of competing ions that are orders of magnitude more concentrated. In Phase I, GlycoSurf intends to combine its proprietary process for the synthetic production of rhamnolipids with ion flotation methods that are well known. In fact, flotation processes are commonly used to treat produced water using conventional treatment trains, but their primary purpose is for removing small size droplets of oil contained within the PW. The potential to combine our unique surfactants with microbubble-enhanced ion flotation for the economic extraction of valuable minerals from PW wastes, represents a new paradigm shift in the development of a low-cost, efficient extraction technology to recover metals from these non-traditional sources. However, there are challenges posed by the chemistry of PW for the extraction and recovery of these elements. The complex composition of PW is highly variable by region; however, GlycoSurf is working with a Marcellus field fracking operation (through Pilot Chemical) to evaluate its specific chemistry. If successful, GlycoSurf in Phase II and beyond, will work with our project partners to implement a new treatment process that will result in an environmentally friendly process having lower costs than are current U and REE separations. Our commercialization strategy will enable this team to work with its industry partners to demonstrate the large-scale deployment of this technology, which will ensure a domestic supply of uranium and critical REEs for industrial."

This contamination can have significant effects in sensitive areas such as the terrestrial aquatic interfaces (TAIs) where the flux of nutrients can change over a relatively short period of time leading to hypoxia and the formation of harmful algal blooms. Researchers and other stakeholders have not been able to adequately monitor these potentially dangerous nutrient fluctuations because of limitations in the monitoring equipment currently available. This knowledge gap will be addressed with the development of a phosphate monitoring system that is robust, accurate and capable of making frequent measurements. Our approach is to adapt cutting edge technology from different aspects of instrument development and integrate them into a micro-fluidic based platform. With a micro-fluidic based system, the resulting device will be extremely portable and require minimal resources for long-term operation. In Phase I of this project the individual components of the instrument will be developed and tested for performance. These components include a specially designed filtration system and will allow the instrument to operate in high sediment conditions which is novel for this type of system. Other components include a unique module to remove chemical interferents and an optical sensing module. These components will be integrated to form the Phase I instrument. Parties from the private sector that would be interested in the development of the proposed instrument include environmental researchers in both academia and in industries that must conduct continuous water/process monitoring. Ultimately, we believe that the proposed product is both highly marketable by and has a high likelihood of attracting further funding from large instrument companies already involved in water monitoring in a variety of situations."

Finding suitable geological storage sites, demonstrating effective CO2 containment, and establishing long-term monitoring of storage reservoirs are key to the safe storage of CO2. The risk of CO2 leakage can be reduced through real-time monitoring and early prediction of possible leaks. Early prediction of leaks involves identifying the onset of a leak and immediately visualizing the migration pathways. The traditional seismic imaging method has some disadvantages: (i) seismic imaging data is not always available, and it is expensive to conduct seismic acquisition and imaging; (ii) the application at larger depths is limited due to the attenuation of sufficiently high frequencies; and (iii) given the expense of seismic acquisition, processing, and analysis, it may be important to record repeat seismic surveys only at critical times. In this proposed research work, we plan to use the large amount of multiscale and multimodal data available in EDX for various formations to create machine learning-aided rock physics models. The aim is to use the data in the EDX platform to develop an end-to-end mapping between the rock and seismic properties. Based on the change in rock properties, the CO2 plume migration path can be visualized. Key parameters from these models will also be used to reduce the uncertainty in the ultimate reservoir storage cost and capacity by integration with reduced order models of dynamic CO2 injection. Rock physics modeling (RPM) development is driven by data availability: X-Ray Diffraction, PVT, and core measurements to provide rock and fluid properties, well logs to calibrate the model, and real-time seismic data to validate RPM-derived synthetic seismic. Therefore, this study is only possible because of the wide variety of data available in EDX for various storage formations. Data mining, therefore, will be an integral part of our proposed project. The biggest hurdle in RPM is the many uncertainties present in the model. While rock physics modeling forms the skeleton of what connects rock and seismic properties, supervised machine learning models become an essential component to reduce the uncertainties between the properties’ mapping and improve the accuracy of the models. Thus, we advocate a physics-based machine learning approach to RPM. The proposed CarbonWatch technology has huge benefits in both the economy and technology, and in minimizing an adverse environmental impact."

When platforms are upgraded with new hardware architecture features to be supported, appropriate extensions to the generator should enable efficient code to be readily regenerated. Very few program generators currently exist because they are difficult to build. The main difficulty stems from the problem of designing an extensible approach to perform all the optimizations that compilers are unable to do. Furthermore, the actual implementation of the program generators often results in ad-hoc collections of stand-alone programs that are hard to extend, reuse, or further develop. The main research objective is to devise programming models and supporting tools that greatly simplify the development of specialized high-performance program generators.

However, a significant hurdle to reaching the full potential of cryo-EM facilities, including those associated with the DOE, involves difficulties with sample preparation. The requirement to vitrify ultrathin samples, especially those associated with single particle analysis (SPA), makes it challenging to reliably produce and easily identify usable cryo-EM sample grids. This project will address these difficulties by developing a novel tool to rapidly screen cryo-EM grids and provide critical information on the thickness of the vitreous ice/sample layer. This information will enable real-time optimization of vitrification procedures, to increase the success and yield of sample production, and improve subsequent biomolecular structure determination using advanced electron microscopes. The technology being developed could be used in either standalone instruments or incorporated into full robotic vitrification systems. A proof-of-concept device will be designed and constructed to validate our approach for rapid and precise screening of cryo-EM sample grids. Its performance will be quantified using realistic vitrified samples on standard cryo-EM grids. Lateral spatial resolution will routinely be below 1?m, and ice-thickness measurement targeted for a precision of a few nm. Several different embodiments of the tool will be evaluated for planning the more sophisticated Phase II prototype instrument. Cryo-EM has experienced explosive growth in recent years, with projected worldwide annual revenue for just electron microscopes to exceed $1B before 2030. Improved sample preparation equipment represents a substantial percentage of this market sector. Cryo-EM data has become central for many areas of basic and applied science, including drug discovery in the huge biotech and pharma industries.

This proposal aims to address manufacturing shortfalls and utilize state-of-the-art metrology to mature the manufacture of precision x-ray mirrors within the United States. Through comprehensive attention to each step in the manufacturing chain and novel smoothing techniques, this project’s approach proposes systematic prevention and mitigation of detrimental mid-and high-spatial frequency errors that typically result from tool signatures during manufacturing. By merging process control during single point diamond turning and research using a novel smoothing technique, troublesome errors can be reduced and subsequent mirror surfaces can move towards sub- nanometer level error. The Phase I goals include 1) quantify and optimize the parameters in the generation and diamond turning steps to reduce subsurface damage and subsequent mid-spatial frequency errors and reduce production time, while evaluating success with relevant metrology such as stitching interferometry, white light interferometry, profilometry, and deflectometry; 2) use a data-driven, deterministic approach and relevant metrology tools to apply a novel smoothing-magnetorheological fluid polishing cycle for surfaces readying them for ion beam figure finishing to achieve final, sub-nanometer form error. A metrology round robin will be performed both internally among various metrology instruments, as well as with the Optics and Metrology group at Brookhaven National Laboratory to quantify surface quality and help determine the required direction for a subsequent Phase II effort. Successful completion of a Phase II plan will lead to domestic production of long x-ray mirrors for needs in the synchrotron community, which will help meet public energy and other scientific research goals. In addition, the techniques developed for smoothing mid-spatial frequency errors can be directly employed for many other optics manufacturing applications, including imaging systems for space telescopes, freeform optics for small satellites, directed energy applications, and optics for semiconductor industries."

Our approach uses x-ray microcalorimeters, a detector technology that was originally driven by the needs of astrophysics missions, where pixels with few-eV spectral resolution are required. We propose to develop this capability for magnetic fusion energy (MFE) devices. Completion of the proposed work will resolve critical issues and establish a path for implementation on fusion facilities, including ITER. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE In MFE devices, x-ray spectroscopy has been a standard diagnostic for measuring fundamental plasma parameters. Two complementary types of x-ray spectrometers are widely used to diagnose MFE plasmas: pulse-height analysis (PHA) systems and crystal spectrometers. PHA systems have a wide bandwidth (~1– 20 keV) with moderate spectral resolution (100–200 eV), while crystal spectrometers typically provide very high resolution (better than a few eV) albeit over narrow energy ranges. X-ray microcalorimeters combine these characteristics and are non-dispersive spectrometers, providing several other advantages: the energy resolution does not degrade with source size and the calorimeters are easy to align, have a high quantum efficiency, and are straightforward to calibrate. An x-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer will require only an ~25 mm diameter radial sightline through the core of a high-temperature fusion plasma, an important advantage over crystal spectrometers, and can be placed tens of meters from a burning plasma. PROJECT APPROACH Our current measurements innovation project has been successful in proving the operation of an x-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer in the pulsed-plasma environment. We installed our instrument on the Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) facility and recorded x-ray photons emitted by the helium-like Al11+ impurity ions in a majority deuterium plasma in 2019. We propose to continue our successful work at MST by developing microcalorimetry for application as a fusion diagnostic using two existing microcalorimeter spectrometers. We plan to perform three experimental campaigns, one per proposal year. The first two campaigns will use the silicon-thermistor microcalorimeter that is currently deployed at MST. Tests include verifying our approach for avoiding neutron irradiation damage (campaign 2). For the final campaign, we will deploy a TES-based spectrometer to prove this technology is compatible with MFE devices, as such an instrument is more suitable for the high count rates produced at MFE facilities. We will also begin laying out conceptual designs for systems optimized to meet the requirements for ITER. IMPACT Our research will transform MFE x-ray spectroscopy for current and future devices by combining broad spectral coverage with high energy resolution to measure Be to W impurity line emission, ion temperature and plasma flow, and electron temperature and density while viewing the plasma through a small diameter (~25 mm) porthole. This development is consistent with the needs of the fusion and plasma science community as highlighted by recent plasma physics community planning process report: “High-resolution x-ray imaging spectroscopy of impurities is critical ... The needed instrumentation advancements include improved spectral resolution, broader spectral coverage, and higher time resolution, ideally with small port access requirements and small equipment footprint.”"

The plasma membrane pump, carrier, and channel proteins together convert the chemical energy of ATP into gradients of organic and inorganic solutes. Other plasma membrane proteins, including receptors and protein kinases, help regulate the transporters in a coordinated fashion to respond to environmental changes. Plants cannot move away and escape from harmful environmental conditions and instead have evolved proteins, such as these transporters, that help minimize the negative impact. My laboratory has developed approaches that allow us to reveal the molecular details of these unique coping mechanisms. These studies have allowed us to investigate a uniquely evolved means of regulating an energy transducing protein, the plasma membrane proton pump, found only in plants and fungi. We will use these tools to study how the chemical energy of ATP is transduced into the electrochemical energy of a transmembrane proton gradient by the plasma membrane proton pump (abbreviated AHA, for Arabidopsis H+-ATPase). In yeast, this protein is encoded by one highly expressed gene known as PMA1, and can be replaced by the plant gene, allowing us to heterologously express the plant protein in higher yields, and to perform a more comprehensive analysis of structure and function.

However, mainstream software requires extraordinarily complex procedures to prepare computer-aided design data for simulation. Even today’s best methods for high-profile problems like simulating automotive crashes require millions of dollars of manual labor to prepare each simulation. After the analysis model is laboriously constructed, it often fails to perform robustly and instead produces low-fidelity or erroneous results, while also consuming vast amount of high-performance computing resources. This limits the opportunity for simulation to actually help create optimal designs. The company is leveraging its significant domain expertise to introduce a fundamentally new approach to computer-aided design and finite element analysis. Its patent-pending approach to isogeometric analysis allows design data to be transformed into a simulation far faster than traditional approaches and introduces a spectrum of ways for engineers to prepare simulations. With this technology, a simulation can be prepared with minimal input or some or all of the simulation mesh can be precisely controlled to allow for optimal computation. The method shifts the burden of providing the required accuracy onto computers.

In these regimes various transient radical species such as HO2, ROO&middot;, &middot;QOOH, HCO, NO2, HOCO, and Criegee intermediates play important roles in determining the detailed as well as more general dynamics. A clear understanding and accurate representation of these processes is needed for effective modeling. Given the difficulties associated with making reliable experimental measurements of these systems, computation can play an important role in developing these energy technologies. Accurate calculations have their own challenges since even within the simplest dynamical approximations such as transition state theory, the rates depend exponentially on critical barrier heights and these may be sensitive to the level of quantum chemistry. Moreover, it is well-known that in many cases it is necessary to go beyond statistical theories and consider the dynamics. Quantum tunneling, resonances, radiative transitions, and non-adiabatic effects governed by spin-orbit or derivative coupling can be determining factors in those dynamics. This project combines developments in the areas of potential energy surface (PES) fitting and multistate multireference quantum chemistry to allow spectroscopically and dynamically/kinetically accurate investigations of key molecular systems (such as those mentioned above), many of which are radicals with strong multireference character and have the possibility of multiple electronic states contributing to the observed dynamics. In addition, new methods and approaches to electronic structure theory will be developed and tested through applications. This project will explore limitations in traditional multireference calculations (e.g., MRCI) such as those imposed by internal contraction, lack of high-order correlation treatment and poor scaling. Methods such as DMRG-based extended active-space CASSCF and various Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods will be applied (including VMC/DMC and FCIQMC). Insight into the relative significance of different orbital spaces and the robustness of application of these approaches on leadership class computing architectures will be gained. Computational thermochemistry will be another aspect of this project. A workflow framework that allows community driven expansion of the ATcT thermochemical database will be further developed. Synergy with other components of this research program such as automated PES fitting and multireference quantum chemistry will be used to address challenges encountered by the standard approaches to computational thermochemistry (those being single-reference quantum chemistry and perturbative treatments of the anharmonic vibrational energy, which break down for some cases of electronic structure or floppy strongly coupled vibrational modes)."

This will require new chemically sensitive imaging methods to be developed. In this SBIR/STTR, we will develop a new coherent Raman-based microscopy technique called Doppler Raman that will improve sensitivity over existing stimulated Raman microscopy techniques by up to three orders of magnitude or more and use this technique to perform functional metabolic imaging of plant and microbial systems non-destructively. In Phase I, label-free imaging of metabolites in crude tobacco cell lysates was demonstrated by Doppler Raman. Compared with a current Raman approach, Doppler Raman’s detection sensitivity was orders of magnitude higher, and the detection was immune to fluorescence in highly autofluorescent tobacco plant cell lysates. We detected the endogenous biomarker nicotine in crude plant lysates and observed another peak that is consistent with heme. Both of these markers are implicated with stress signaling in response to insect attack, drought, heat and nutrient deficiency, making them ideal markers for plant health. In Phase II the sensitivity of Doppler Raman will be improved using the approaches conceptualized in Phase I. A Doppler Raman microscope will be assembled and the biomarkers nicotine and ATP/ADP will be imaged in live tobacco plant cells. The future commercial application and public benefits are a technology that is the first able to detect several metabolites simultaneously in crude lysates or intact cells without the use of fluorescent, radioactive, or Raman signal-enhancing tags. This new imaging approach and instrumentation will naturally contribute to other fields, such as the medical diagnostics and pharmaceutical fields."
Position-specific carbon isotope analysis via a novel proton NMR tool and its application to organic molecules,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0022524,"Rasmussen, Cornelia",Cornelia.Rasmussen@theuniversityoftexasataustin,"['system', 'high', 'energy', 'research', 'new', 'approach', 'investigator', 'material']","Position-specific carbon isotope analysis via a novel proton NMR tool and its application to organic molecules Cornelia Rasmussen, University of Texas at Austin (Principal Investigator) David W. Hoffman, University of Texas at Austin (Co-Investigator) The goal of the proposed research plan is to develop novel proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) methods for determining 13C/12C isotope ratios for the individual carbon positions within molecules, and apply these techniques to key organics of different origin and complexity. For over 60 years, 13C/12C isotope ratios have been used to correlate organic carbon with its source. However, traditional analyses are obtained as averages across bulk samples or whole molecules, masking the wealth of information contained within the intramolecular isotope distribution. Position-specific analysis uncovers these untapped layers of information, greatly increasing the power of carbon isotope analysis as an investigative tool, with potential applications in a wide range of fields, including the (bio)geosciences and forensics. We have the following specific aims: (1) Develop accurate and precise one- and two-dimensional tools that exploit the advantages of 1H NMR for position-specific 13C/12C isotope analysis, such as applying our technique to molecules of various complexity within organic mixtures. Furthermore, we will establish protocols for extracting organic molecules from biomass, suitable for our 1H NMR technique; (2) Intercalibrate the method across multiple NMR instruments and with mass spectrometry techniques using standard materials that have been developed for validating position-specific carbon isotope analysis by the United States Geological Survey (consisting of glycine and valine amino acid standards); and (3) Apply our techniques to molecules that are of interest to the (bio)geosciences as they are key building blocks for life and/or represent important biomarkers, such as amino acids and isoprenoids of known origin. This will allow us to make first order observations of the effects of biosynthetic pathways or modular synthesis on the position-specific isotope information. Our 1H NMR method is fundamentally different from other approaches for measuring the relative abundance of 13C and 12C in samples of organic carbon. 1H NMR provides absolute 13C/12C isotope ratios, without the need to fragment the molecule for analysis, or correct for the presence of different oxygen isotopes. Our preliminary results have demonstrated that our 1H NMR approach is capable of obtaining accurate position-specific 13C/12C isotope ratios in a range of complex organics, including amino acids, carboxylic acids and nucleosides, which have been found to preserve an isotopic fingerprint within their intramolecular isotope distribution. Position-specific carbon isotope analysis has the potential to become an information-rich and robust tool for distinguishing molecules that are otherwise chemically identical. Ultimately, the field of position-specific isotope analysis will provide new insight into the fundamental rules that govern the origin of intramolecular carbon isotope variability, such as how isotope fractionation propagates throughout biosynthetic pathways and the relative effects of kinetic versus equilibrium isotope fractionation. Relevant to the geosciences, position-specific isotope analysis has the potential to link organic carbon to its source with greater precision than traditional methods that are limited to bulk or whole molecule analysis. The new 1H NMR methods that we develop will produce new and unique data that will contribute to the understanding of the fundamental basis of carbon isotope distribution within bioorganic molecules, thus providing an important step toward testing hypotheses about the interpretation of intramolecular carbon isotope distributions."

Wyslouch (PI), I. Stewart (Task Supervisor) Center for Theoretical Physics, Laboratory for Nuclear Science Massachusetts Institute of Technology Project Summary The MIT High Energy Theory Group proposes a broad research program in theoretical high energy physics. The proposed research ranges from dark energy, cosmology, quantum gravity, and string theory at the highest energy scales to questions in particle physics phenomenology and field theory at lower energies and includes research that connects with quantum information theory. The proposed grant would help support the research of eight principal investigators — Netta Engelhardt, Alan Guth, Daniel Harlow, Hong Liu, Tracy Slatyer, Washington Taylor, Jesse Thaler, and Barton Zwiebach — and also approximately eight graduate students and two postdocs. Objectives of the proposed research program cover almost all fields of current research in high energy physics. On the string theory front, the proposal includes investigations of foundational aspects of string theory and work towards characterizing the variety of string and supergravity vacua. The proposal includes research on the rapidly developing connections between quantum gravity and quantum information theory, which are relevant for understanding black holes, cosmology, and the fundamental nature of gravity theories. It also includes the application of techniques that arise in string theory to understand strongly-interacting quantum systems and transport in quantum hydrodynamic systems, as well as research on fundamental questions in quantum field theory and general relativity. For phenomenology and beyond-the-standardmodel physics, this proposal is aimed at understanding how to extract hints of new physics from new data from colliders and astrophysical observations. Parts of the proposal focus in particular on questions about how to identify and characterize dark matter, which may have already given rise to astrophysical signatures, including developing new models of dark matter. Dark energy presumably indicates a nonzero vacuum energy density, and explaining the small value of this constant is a key challenge for fundamental physics. The proposal includes work on eternal inflation, which is one approach of resolving this issue, as well as more concrete phenomenological questions about cosmology and inflation. The proposed work will make use of a variety of physics techniques, including perturbative and nonperturbative methods in quantum field theory. Computational methods will play a significant role not only in understanding phenomenological data from the LHC and other experiments, but also in systematically analyzing string theory solutions and in understanding connections between quantum information systems and gravity theories. Recent developments in mathematics, particularly geometry, also play an important role in parts of the project related to quantum gravity and string theory. The use of many of these methods involves interactions and collaboration with other faculty at MIT and elsewhere in the physics, math, and computer science departments. The direct impact of this research will be an improved understanding of the nature of fundamental forces, quantum systems, and the large-scale structure of our universe, leading to a deeper understanding of the theoretical structure describing physical phenomena. Indirect impacts include the development of physical, mathematical, and computational tools with broad applicability, and the training of students and postdocs in theoretical physics."

Rogers, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Co-Principal Investigator Christopher J. Lister, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Co-Investigator The discovery potential of present-day Low Energy Nuclear Science lies at the edges of nuclear stability. The upcoming Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) in the USA promises to produce thousands of heretofore unobserved isotopes far from the valley of stability. This proposal is for continuing research towards FRIB science, through studies that span the range from the lightest to the heaviest nuclei, from the proton drip line to neutron-rich fragments of heavy primary beams. Modern ab-initio calculations are tested through precise measurements of electromagnetic transition rates in light nuclei at NSCL and TRIUMF. The fragile balance at the limits of Coulomb stability in the heaviest nuclei are studied at the ATLAS facility at Argonne, using techniques of recoil-decay-tagged gamma-ray spectroscopy. Fundamental questions concerning the origin and evolution of nuclei are addressed, through studies of proton-rich nuclei critical for understanding explosive nucleosynthesis, such as the rapid proton-capture (rp) process, as well as nuclei along the N=Z line which exhibit the exotic decay mode of proton radioactivity. Long-lived metastable states in extreme neutron-rich nuclei are populated via fragmentation reactions of heavy beams at NSCL, the highest-Z elements are studied using the Argonne Gas-Filled Analyzer at ATLAS, and beta-decay of neutron-rich medium-mass fission fragments are studied at the CARIBU facility at Argonne, both from nuclear structure as well as nuclear astrophysics perspectives. The proposed research at national accelerator facilities is augmented by synergistic equipment development projects that will be important in the FRIB era where new technologies are needed to reach the science goals."

Zhang, Jefferson Lab, Newport News, VA We propose a novel approach for detecting charged particles based on their interaction with atoms prepared in a special quantum superposition of states. We will take advantage of the enhanced sensitivity of the highly excited (Rydberg) states of alkali metal atoms to the electric field created by a charged particle to track its motion and recreate an image of its trajectory. Atoms will be prepared in a so-called “dark” superposition of an electronic ground state and a Rydberg state that inhibits fluorescence and enhances optical transmission. A passing charged particle will disturb this quantum state, creating a ""shadow"" in the transmitted laser beam, thus enabling direct optical imaging of the particle trajectory. Moreover, by using a quantum-correlated optical fields in a so-called two-mode intensity squeezed state, we will be able to further increase the sensitivity of this method and thus enhance the quantum tracker performance. Based on the success of the initial R&D this project will move to the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility where we will increase the physical size and improve tracking rate and resolution for use in accelerator and nuclear physics research."

While these amorphous films were normally considered as a homogeneous system, recent powerful characterization and computation technologies have uncovered the existence of multiple intermediates which may possess unique local bonding and short- or medium-range periodicity in their crystal structure. However, study of the possible intermediates in oxide materials and their corresponding structure-property relationship is still mostly missing. Many kinetic factors associated with the synthesis processes and the application environment may create substantial impact on the formation of intermediates and introduce unexpected heterogeneity in the amorphous oxides, resulting in dramatic performance variation. We recent discovered the record long lifetime of TiO2/Si photoelectrochemical (PEC) cathode has provided a clear demonstration of how intermediates in amorphous TiO2 thin films can impact device stability. Driven by these intriguing research discoveries, this research project aims to understand the structure and properties of hidden intermediates in amorphous oxides grown by ALD, and apply what is learned to achieve predictive phase and property control in the ALD synthesis of amorphous oxide thin films. This research project is designed under one overarching hypothesis that the hidden intermediates have distinct local atomic order that yields distinct properties from locally disordered amorphous and crystalline phases in ALD oxide films; and their appearance is essential to the film&rsquo;s macroscopic properties, which can be controlled by a number of kinetic factors in the synthesis process and application environment. The proposed research will address three critical questions in the science and synthesis of amorphous ALD oxide materials. (1) What are the structures of the intermediates? (2) How do the intermediate&rsquo;s structures correlate to their properties? (3) How do we control the formation of intermediates? By using amorphous ALD TiO2 thin films as a model material system, three main research tasks are proposed in this project to answer these questions. In task I, we will use a series of state-of-the-art characterization approaches (particularly ex-situ and in-situ nano-diffraction and fluctuation electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and neutron diffraction) combined with advanced structure determination that aim to obtain quantitative knowledge of the atomic structure of the intermediates. In task II, we will study properties that are mostly relevant to energy applications, including electronic properties, ionic conductivities, and chemical stabilities, and correlates these properties to the structures of intermediates. In task III, we will investigate various ALD synthesis conditions and application environmental factors and gain the knowledge and ability of controlling the formation of intermediates during ALD synthesis. The outcome of this project will be transformative knowledge of intermediates that have been overlooked through the pathway of crystallization of ALD amorphous oxide films. It will help developing a predictive synthesis science for functional amorphous materials with precisely designed properties for next-generation energy harvesting and storage devices."

It is anticipated that disease threats for new crops will arise from contact with similar crop species. Setosphaeria turcica (syn. Exserohilum turcicum) can infect both maize and sorghum, yet isolates are host specific. Sorghum leaf blight (SLB), caused by S. turcica, is widespread and can decrease yields, reduce forage quantity and quality, and predispose plants to other diseases such as anthracnose (causal organism: Colletotrichum sublineolum). Host resistance is one of the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective methods of disease control, and resistance can be conserved across different plant species. By leveraging the knowledge of resistance in maize, we will accelerate the improvement of resistance to S. turcica in sorghum, while also developing this as a system to understand how microbes evolve to become pathogens of bioenergy crops. Furthermore, genes can confer resistance to other pathogens when tested in new systems, and we will assess the relationship between resistance to sorghum leaf blight and anthracnose. Our overall objective is to improve biotic stress resistance in sorghum, and to achieve this we will use a paired strategy of identifying plant genes that will confer resistance and identifying fungal genes that are key deterrents of a host jump from corn to sorghum. The identification of the genes involved in this interaction will enhance the prospects for strategic deployment of sustainable host resistance-based approaches in bioenergy crops."

The goal of this hypotheses-driven research program is to elucidate the role of the microstructural scale, morphology and interphase boundary structure and crystallography in enabling plastic co-deformability in high-strength metallic composites containing disparate phases. The proposed work aims to fill the gaps in knowledge in the fundamental understanding of plastic flow in metallic composites with soft/hard phases: - Is plastic co-deformability favored as the interphase boundary spacing is reduced to nanoscale? - Does the morphology (e.g., continuous vs degenerate lamellae or rods) of the hard phase influence plastic co-deformability? - Can plastic co-deformability be achieved in composites with cubic/non-cubic phases? - What is the role of the defect structure and crystallography of the interphase boundary in promoting plastic co-deformability? Al-Cu, Al-Ni and Al-Cu-Si based eutectic systems will be used as model systems of metal-intermetallic composites with a range of sizes, morphologies and interface crystallography needed to test the proposed hypotheses. Suction casting in water-cooled Cu molds and laser surface re-melting will enable refinement of eutectic microstructures from a few hundreds to a couple tens of nanometers. Nanoindentation, compression and tensile testing, and in situ nanoindentation and tension in high-resolution transmission electron microscope will be used to elucidate the mechanisms of slip transfer across and dislocation nucleation at interphase boundaries, and to quantify the local stresses that lead to plasticity in the intermetallic phase. To gain fundamental understanding and develop predictive capability of the plastic co-deformation mechanisms, the experimental findings will be integrated with multi-scale modeling involving atomistic modeling, meso-scale and crystal plasticity. Defect and interface-level properties obtained from atomistic modeling will be the input in the meso-scale model to compute strain hardening and local stress-strain response in a unit bi-crystal that will then be fed into the crystal plasticity finite element method to compute the macroscopic stress-strain response. The integrated R&D approach of laser processing, nanomechanics (in situ, high-resolution, quantitative) and multi-scale modeling is crucial gaining new insights in the nucleation and propagation of plasticity across interphase boundaries in nanoscale confined soft/hard multiphase metallic materials. The final results will be presented in the form of maps that show trends for plastic co-deformability in high-strength composites as a function of microstructural length scales (includes interphase boundary spacing, diameter or thickness of the hard phase and the ratio of the metal to hard phase thickness, and aspect ratio of the hard phase), hard phase morphology, interface crystallography and ratio of flow stresses of the metal and hard phases. The research will provide the scientific underpinning crucial to the design of ultra-strong metallic alloys (e.g., Al alloys with > 1 GPa strength levels) that exhibit significant plastic deformability at room temperature."

Anlage, Physics Department, University of Maryland (Principal Investigator) Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities have great utility in particle accelerators, intense light sources, and medical applications. It is desired to increase the accelerating gradient of these cavities to facilitate even more applications of benefit to society. The high-RF-magnetic-field performance of SRF cavities is sometimes limited by breakdown events below the intrinsic limiting surface fields of the superconductor (typically Niobium, Nb), and there is abundant evidence that these breakdown events are localized in space inside the cavity. Also, there is need to develop a detailed understanding of the causal links between surface treatments and ultimate RF performance at low temperatures. An understanding of these links would provide a clear roadmap for improvement of SRF cavity performance, and establish a cause-and-effect ‘SRF materials science’ of Nb. We propose a microscopic approach to addressing these issues. We have established a spatially-resolved local microwave-microscope probe that operates at SRF frequencies and temperatures to discover the microscopic origins of breakdown, and produce quantitative measurements of RF critical fields of coatings and films. A second generation microscope is planned which will give additional insights into the superconductor under extreme conditions. The microscopes will be used in conjunction with surface preparation and characterization techniques to create definitive links between physical and chemical processing steps and ultimate cryogenic microwave performance. We propose to develop scanning microscopy of small-sample Nb pieces to establish surface-processing / RF performance relations through measurement of RF “extreme linear” and nonlinear response on sub-micron-length scales and low temperatures. This work will help establish direct causal links between surface processing and SRF behavior of Nb. It will identify those defects in Nb that limit the high field performance, and also identify those defects that are relatively benign. It will illuminate the basic physics of RF surface breakdown. It will also test the ability of novel surface coatings to enhance the SRF cavity accelerating gradients. The results of this research will help to reduce the cost of a superconducting particle accelerator by improving the surface properties of Nb and enabling SRF cavities to be reproducibly built with higher accelerating gradient. The work will be performed by PI Steven Anlage and one graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park, along with essential interactions with collaborators in the SRF community."

Under this award a number of applications of the SMF approach are carried out, as summarized below: In the basis of the SMF approach, a quantal diffusion description for multi-nucleon transfer in deep-inelastic and quasi-fission reactions was recently developed for low energy heavy-ion collisions. Transport coefficients for nucleon exchange include the quantal effects due to shell structure, take into account full collision geometry and Pauli blocking effects. Transport coefficients, which describe the fluctuation dynamics, are entirely determined by the mean-field properties in terms of the Time Dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) wave functions of the occupied states. This fact is consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Numerical calculations of transport coefficients in central collisions of several systems were carried out employing a three-dimensional TDHF code with some modification. The multi-nucleon transfer mechanism in the 48Ca+238U and 58Ni+60Ni collisions were analyzed and compared to the result with the measured fragment mass distributions. The analysis of the nucleon exchange mechanism in 239U+238U, which is currently under investigation at GANIL, France, is in progress. In addition, the quantal transport description based on the SMF is being extended for the energy dissipation and angular momentum transfer in deep-inelastic and quasi-fission reactions. The quantal transport description is expected to provide a very useful basis for understanding gross properties of the fragment mass and charge distributions, the energy dissipation-fluctuation, and the angular momentum transfer in collisions with radioactive nuclei. In another application, the spontaneous symmetric fission mechanism of 258Fm was analyzed by direct simulation of the SMF beyond the saddle point in terms of a truncated particle-hole basis. A good description of the total kinetic energy and the mass distribution of the fission fragments was obtained. Under the present award, the spontaneous and induced fission mechanism of heavy nuclei beyond the saddle point is studied as a diffusion process, and the macroscopic quantal transport description outlined above is applied to calculate the total kinetic energy and mass distribution of fission fragments. The fission mechanism in the microscopic basis of the SMF is also being examined by specifying the initial fluctuations in terms of the zero-point quantal and the thermal fluctuations of the low-frequency dominant collective surface modes. Since symmetries in the initial state are broken by the quantal zero-point and thermal fluctuations, it may be possible to fission the compound nucleus in the microscopic framework of the SMF approach. In yet another application of the SMF, employing the linear response treatment, the early growth of density fluctuations and the initial condensation mechanism in the spinodal region of charge symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter are studied in the semi-classical approximation, more recently in the quantal framework. For a complete description of spinodal decomposition of the unstable system and the dynamics of liquid-gas phase transformation, it is necessary to investigate large amplitude density fluctuations. The spinodal decomposition of a finite nuclear system is examined by carrying out long-time simulations of the SMF approach by employing the practical simulation method indicated above. We carry out these investigations in the non-relativistic SMF approach by employing existing TDHF and RPA codes, and modifying these codes in a manner suitable for our calculations."

The new pilot plants are sized for a 10 MW net power output; a good size to gain valuable data for larger utility scale power plants. This is also a very good size for the smaller, distributed power applications. The distributed power application is envisaged as the primary application for the roll out of the technology. The reliability of the plants during the introductory phase will be very important. A panel of power plant executives at the recent DOE conference on sCO2 has made it clear that the initial cost, operating cost, and up-time reliability must be demonstrated before any significant investment at the public utility level is seen. Pursuant to this point, the reliability of the system will be the next great focus for the sCO2 systems. When a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is done at a system level, machinery design with fault tolerance will be a priority. Machinery up-time and system contamination effects will be high on the list of risks. The new machines proposed for the pilot plants use oil bearings and gas seals. A turbocompressor with two gas seals and another machine with integral gear and 4 gas seals will be installed in the plants. It is well understood that reliability for turbomachinery is highly dependent upon the bearing and sealing systems. Upsets, surges, fluid-driven instability, start-up variations, and variation in thrust loading are all acceptable if the bearings and seals can tolerate them. Concepts NREC has proposed a design approach to improve reliability by addressing the bearing and seals. This approach includes: 1) Reduce the number of seals down to one seal. 2) Eliminate the oil entirely with magnetic bearings. Elimination of the oil removes a source of seal distress, and also serves to eliminate the possibility of fouling of the heat exchangers. The magnetic bearings will provide improved monitoring capability and can be used for active fluid force measurement in a machine."

The proposed program encompasses four primary topics: (1) Magnetohydrodynamics and Disruption Physics, (2) Confinement and Transport (including energetic particles), (3) Boundary and Pedestal Physics, and (4) Integrated Simulation and Modeling (including sources and current drive). Substantial progress in theoretical understanding, numerical tool development, and model validation with experimental data has been made across each of these topics in the prior three-year grant period. Highlights of recent progress include (a) development and testing of a capability to predict confinement time and plasma stored energy using coupled core-pedestal physics models, (b) theoretical predictions of Super H-Mode access which facilitated achievement of record pedestal pressure on Alcator C-Mod and high fusion performance on DIII-D, (c) development and simulation of dispersive shell pellets for efficient inside-out disruption mitigation, (d) development and implementation of a numerically efficient and massively scalable anti-symmetric method for solution of general hierarchies of fluid equations (ALMA), and (e) major enhancements to gyrokinetic (CGYRO) and neoclassical (NEO) simulation capability including sonic rotation, comprehensive collision operators, and multiscale/multi-species capability which have identified important poloidal asymmetry effects on heavy impurity transport and novel isotope effects on turbulent transport. The proposed plan for new research builds upon this progress, and incorporates guidance from the 2015 and 2017 community planning process, the DOE FES ten year strategic plan (2015-25), and the 2018 National Academies Burning Plasma report, including increased emphasis on integrated simulation (moving toward whole device modeling), transients, and boundary physics, and focus on advanced high fusion power density regimes.

The proposed research will enhance and apply these existing tools to key problems in fusion plasma physics, as well as develop potentially transformative new approaches (e.g. ALMA). The research will leverage advanced computational capabilities developed within the SciDAC program, and comprehensively validate theoretical predictions against measurements on DIII-D and other experiments. As understanding and simulation tools in multiple areas continue to advance, we will further enhance integrated simulation capabilities, and apply these toward the prediction and optimization of existing and future devices such as ITER. In addition, we plan to further study and optimize paths toward commercial fusion energy, including studies of high power density and compact pilot plant scenarios."
Overcoming optical selection rules in materials by extreme localization of light,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0020101,"Harutyunyan, Hayk",Hayk.Harutyunyan@emoryuniversity,"['quantum', 'material', 'energy', 'state', 'system', 'new', 'university', 'project']","Overcoming optical selection rules in materials by extreme localization of light Hayk Harutyunyan, Department of Physics, Emory University The optical properties of materials are typically determined by their electronic band structure. Thus, in the quest to achieve controllable modification of the optical properties of materials, the most widely used approach is the engineering of their electronic structure. The ability to tune these material properties enables novel functionalities in optical and photonic applications. This is typically achieved by tailoring the material properties and geometry on the nanoscale which control the electronic states and transitions. In general this approach is limited by materials' constraints and the ability to control their geometry. In this project we aim to tune the optical properties of the materials by modifying the properties of light itself. This will be achieved by tuning the momentum of the photons through spatial confinement of the electromagnetic fields. Typically, the momentum of a free-space photon is negligibly small compared to electron momenta which results in &ldquo;near-vertical&rdquo; transitions in energy-momentum space, with no change in electron momentum. Extreme, nanometer-scale localization of electromagnetic fields can remove this fundamental constraint and create &ldquo;large momentum photons&rdquo;. In this program we will utilize metal plasmonic nanoparticles to achieve nanometer scale light confinement enabling efficient &ldquo;non-vertical&rdquo; optical transitions. The spatial confinement of the fields results in large field wavevectors in the momentum space opening up new pathways for plasmon-assisted optical transitions in materials. By effectively creating &ldquo;large momentum photons&rdquo; using our metal-dielectric nano-architectures and we will induce novel quantum mechanical processes that will result in &ldquo;non-vertical&rdquo; electronic transitions in materials. Several forbidden electronic transitions will be studied in this project, including intraband transitions in noble metals and interband transitions in Si and 2D semiconductors. The successful completion of this project will enable the tuning of absorption parameters in materials. This will allow to control the optical properties of materials in a unique manner, leading to novel applications in optical energy control. For example, boosting the efficiency of intraband transitions in metallic nanoparticles can lead to efficient hot electron generation in these systems that can be used in photochemistry and photodetection. Another area of possible applications are efficient ultrafast, nonlinear elements and devices for photonics such as photodetectors, LEDs and ultrafast optical switches. In this program we will harness the high losses of metal plasmonic systems that often hamper the performance of metal-based optical devices and will use them for the exploration of new efficient optical processes."

Abbott, Cornell University (Principal Investigator) Juan J. de Pablo, University of Chicago (Co-Investigator) Biological systems function out of equilibrium, with structure and dynamics that arise from dissipative processes involving the interplay of advective and diffusive transport. The complex dynamic behaviors found in biology often reflect highly non-linear phenomena that lead to surprisingly localized responses to delocalized fields. In this project, we will explore an emerging class of dynamic, cooperative phenomena that have recently been observed in liquid crystals (LCs) – solitary waves, or “solitons”, as the basis of new designs of active soft matter for achieving rapid and directed transport processes and new modes of energy transduction. These localized responses have analogies to many other physical and biological phenomena and have only recently been shown to occur in LCs. Solitons consist of waves of localized orientational perturbations that can travel at high speed and over long distances. They can interact with particles and form a variety of organized, non-equilibrium assemblies, thereby offering exciting opportunities to achieve new forms of active matter. Through closely coupled simulations and experiments, this project will address open questions regarding the mechanisms by which solitons form and move, with the long-term goal of manipulating them for applications. Key questions regarding the mechanism and formation of solitons in nematics will be addressed, with a focus on how to create solitons in a predictable and controlled manner, and how to guide them through programmed trajectories. The scope of the effort includes studies of the interactions of solitons with inclusions in LCs and how motion of solitons drives colloidal transport processes. Additional, longer term goals of the project extend to combined experimental and simulation-based studies of soliton dynamics in chiral nematic systems and the use of laser and acoustic fields to create and interfere solitary waves in nematic materials. These latter aspects of the program of research are high risk and highly exploratory; they offer the intriguing possibility of conceptual, paradigm shifting breakthroughs in non-equilibrium LC systems. Overall, this research is expected to lead to designs of active soft matter that provide new modes of energy transduction, opening up the possibility of new approaches to active transport with applications, for example, to nanoscale separations and assembly processes."
Towards the development of rare event simulation methods for improved mechanistic understanding of mineral surface reactivity,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0018439,"Wallace, Adam",Adam.Wallace@universityofdelaware,"['energy', 'research', 'material', 'high', 'reaction', 'new', 'approach', 'plasma']","Many of the energy related challenges facing the nation depend upon the nature of interactions between geological materials (i.e. soils, sediments, and rock formations) and fluids in subsurface environments. These include: mitigation of organic and inorganic contaminants associated with mining operations, hydraulically fractured oil shales, and nuclear materials; evaluation of potential sites for long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide and spent nuclear waste; and utilization of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery. The inherent challenges involved in accessing the subsurface necessitates the use of theoretical models to investigate the potential response of these settings to changing environmental conditions. In this regard, molecular scale simulations are particularly valuable tools because they provide mechanistic insights into chemical processes that cannot be inferred from macroscale observations or continuum scale models alone. However, at present the applicability of molecular scale simulations is generally limited to short time and length scales. There is therefore, a critical need to develop simulation methods that can circumvent these timescale limitations and provide mechanistic insights into reactive events using existing high-performance computing resources. In this research, we advance the development of unbiased rare event simulation methods to investigate the kinetics of mineral surface reactions on nano- to micro-second timescales. We will validate our methods through a series of benchmark studies on ligand exchange reactions, whose mechanisms, kinetics, and energetics are relatively well-constrained by previous experimental measurements and simulations. Further, we will extend our approach to investigate the kinetics of ligand exchange reactions at the mineral-water interface; namely, ion attachment/detachment reactions on ionic crystals, and transitions between inner and outer-sphere surface complexes on oxide and silicate mineral surfaces. These studies will both inform upon the nature of reactions taking place at the mineral-water interface and provide the feedback necessary to identify and rectify deficiencies in our simulation protocols. This research program will: (1) expand upon existing simulation capabilities to facilitate analysis of more complex dynamic processes; (2) improve the ability to identify and observe transitions between important stable and metastable states; (3) extend the simulation accessible timescale to facilitate more direct correspondence with experiment; (4) provide constraints for upscaling to more coarse-grained modeling approaches; and (5) provide and maintain open source computational tools."

Despite significant research activity, our understanding of charge-transfer processes at nanoparticles remains incomplete. The long-term objective of our work is to use nanoelectrochemical experimental techniques in combination with mathematical modeling to attain quantitative understanding of charge- and mass-transfer processes at single metal and semiconductor nanoparticles relevant to solar energy conversion processes. This proposal represents an extensive effort to develop high-resolution nanoelectrochemical techniques for probing heterogeneous reactions at single nanoparticles. The scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) will be used as a tool for nanoscale mapping of charge-transfer reactions in the dark and under illumination. The tunneling mode of the SECM operation developed in our laboratory during the last two years with the DOE support will be used to investigate charge-transfer processes between the SECM tip and a semiconductor NP and between a metal NP and underlying semiconductor surface with the atomic scale vertical (z-axis) resolution. We will develop an experimental setup for photo-SECM measurements on the nanoscale in which a glass-sealed SECM probe will simultaneously serve as a nanoelectrode and a light guide to carry out electrochemical experiments within a microscopic light spot produced on the sample surface. This technique will be used to map local rates of water splitting on atomic steps and terraces of rutile TiO2 single crystals. The substrate generation/tip collection mode of SECM will be employed to measure the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction at individual co-catalyst nanoparticles electrodeposited on the semiconductor photocathode. This approach will be combined with the complimentary feedback-mode SECM imaging to enable size and shape characterization of a NP prior to photo-electrochemical activity measurement. Further progress will allow us to study electrochemical processes at individual facets of a NP. The proposed experimental studies and modeling will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of physicochemical processes in nanoelectrochemical systems, which is essential for the progress in solar photochemical energy conversion. The expected major products of the proposed research are (1) new experimental methodology for quantitative studies of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes at single metal and semiconductor nanoparticles; (2) nanoscale maps of photocatalytic reactivities of atomic steps and terraces on semiconductor surfaces; and (3) determination of hydrogen evolution kinetics at single co-catalyst nanoparticles. The developed techniques will impact the important BES technologies, including the photocatalytic or electrocatalytic splitting of water, and contribute to research efforts of other groups within Solar Photochemistry program."

We will apply imaging methodologies at the core of medical MRI to efficiently map shallow groundwater and hydrogeologic properties at improved resolution. Conventional surface NMR has been proven as a powerful non-invasive technique for coarse groundwater imaging. The method is limited, however, by simplistic imaging protocols. To enhance sensitivity and spatial resolution, we will introduce “switched-field” NMR. This new paradigm combines gradient and prepolarization fields to allow localization of signals based on their frequency and phase response and will increase the signal-to-noise ratio for shallow water. In addition to improving resolution, these approaches will also accelerate measurement speed allowing the technology to be applied in a wider range of environments and markets. Having established feasibility in Phase 1, the Phase 2 work will fully develop and commercialize the use of switched fields for groundwater imaging. In the first task, we will complete a comprehensive framework for the forward modelling, processing, and interpretation of switched field data. These simulations will also be used to evaluate novel acquisition and processing methodologies improving upon those explored in Phase 1. In the second task, a complete system will be developed for commercial sale, including robust, modular, and lower cost power electronics, next-generation data acquisition interfacing and control, as well as customer-facing software for user-friendly survey planning, data acquisition, and data interpretation. In the final task, the developed technology will be validated and demonstrated in a large number of field project, including local test sites, government environmental research projects, and commercial geotechnical projects. Completion of this technology will deliver a powerful groundwater imaging product for commercial sale, rental, and/or services in the environmental, geotechnical, and subsurface research markets. This technology will be of value to companies, governments, and public agencies facing problems such as groundwater contamination, dewatering for geotechnical engineering, and permafrost mapping. The ability to image at high-resolution in with reduced survey times will improve the reliability of subsurface models, reduce site characterization costs, support informed decision making.

Davidson, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, Appalachian Laboratory (Co-Investigator) P. Megonigal, Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (Unfunded Collaborator) M. Weintraub, University of Toledo (Unfunded Collaborator) The Terrestrial Aquatic Interfaces (TAIs) with dynamic hydrological exchange represent the most biogeochemically active and diverse systems. Frequent hydrological oscillations due to tidal inundations and storm surges regulate oxidation-reduction(redox)-driven biogeochemical transformations and fluxes of carbon and nutrients across TAIs. Soil microsites, the most biogeochemically active soil components, further complicate such hydrological dynamic-driven redox biogeochemistry by creating spatial heterogeneity and variations in reaction kinetics. The functional forms of the interactions among water, carbon and redox sensitive compounds may differ at microsite-, plot- and ecosystem-scales. How microsite-scale processes manifest into plot-scale and ecosystem-scale functions will control long-term dynamics of GHGs in these dynamic interfaces. These complex interconnected processes across TAIs are underrepresented in current ecosystem and Earth system models (Bailey et al., 2017)because we lack a dynamic modeling framework that (1) captures the heterogeneity of soil microsites driving non-normal distribution of microbial activities and (2) integrates interconnected processes across scales. We propose a new modeling framework to capture the heterogeneity of soil microsites to enable dynamic predictions of redox processes and associated GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions across the Terrestrial Aquatic Interfaces (TAIs). Our overall goal is to predict GHG dynamics in the TAIs by incorporating probability distributions of redox processes at soil microsites using a coupled modeling-experimental (ModEx) approach. We will build a new modeling framework merging the capabilities of microsite Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the DAMM-GHG (Dual Arrhenius and Michaelis Menten-GreenHouseGas, Sihi et al., 2020a, b) model with a redox reaction network model (Zheng et al., 2019). The new model framework contains three key components: (1) Microsite PDFs, (2) PDF-constrained redox reaction networks, and (3) Redox reaction networks within soil pore-network informing diffusion-limitation of substrates related to productions and consumptions of GHGs. We will test our modeling framework by synthesizing long-term field data, coupling laboratory (and field) manipulation experiments, and leveraging potential activities in the COMPASS program. Specifically, we will focus our study on a tidal wetland site (Global Change Research Wetland, GCREW, in MD) and a freshwater wetland site (Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve in OH). The proposed exploratory work closely aligns with the COMPASS program goal to advance understanding of the interactions of the ecology and biogeochemistry of microbes, water, soils, and plants within coastal TAIs, and to improve representations of coupled TAI processes in site/regional scale models and ultimately Earth system models like E3SM. Soil heterogeneity represents an important yet unresolved component in biogeochemical models. This project, building and validating a microsite PDF function based computational tool, represents a great advance in generating transferrable modeling capabilityfrom fine-scale processes to ecosystem-scale functions (Sihi et al., 2018), directly supporting BER priorities of understanding multi-scale Earth system dynamics and processes. The proposed ModEx work is tightly aligned with DOE-BER missions supporting robust development of models that examine the feedback between biosphere and Earth’s climate system."

While solutions for managing individual aspects of EE programs exist, they are disjointed and do not easily integrate with DoE tools that offer valuable, data-driven insights for improving EE. Furthermore, they are cost-prohibitive when applied to portfolio scales, and require costly customer relationship management platforms to distribute insights to building owners. As a result, municipalities, utilities, and private organizations are resorting to ad hoc approaches to EE program management that are costly and less impactful. PBER will enable the next generation of EE programs to leverage cutting-edge data integration, analytics, and outreach capabilities to spur EE improvements across large building portfolios. By uniquely facilitating portfolio- level management of building assets, measures, and energy data, PBER will accelerate market adoption of energy benchmarking and auditing programs through which data collection and analytical tools developed by the Department of Energy will be applied. The centralization of EE programs will generate efficiencies that reduce program costs and enable a new class of more insightful analytical reports. Finally, PBER will enable these insights to reach an unprecedented number of building owners through novel public profiles. Maalka successfully deployed a fully functioning proof-of-concept that integrates data across DoE services to allows users to monitor the collection of BuildingSync-compliant asset and measure implementation data and understand building performance trends across portfolios. The platform also integrates building, asset, and performance data into reports that can be published to publicly accessible URLs. Maalka also conducted a dozen structured interviews with prospective users to inform development, successfully deployed pilots for two customers, and established new partnerships through which PBER can scale in Phase II. In Phase II, Maalka will deepen PBER’s integration with BSXML and AssetScore, more fully integrate energy benchmarking and auditing program management workflows, integrate Phase I feedback to optimize portfolio-scale dashboards for managing assets, measures, and performance data for thousands of buildings, and significantly expand the capabilities of Public Profiles to revolutionize how EE programs engage building owners with actionable insights and information. Maalka will also establish new partnerships through which to scale PBER. Beyond the previously covered use-cases, PBER will facilitate more flexible, bulk purchasing strategies at the portfolio-scale, enable more targeted engagement with building owners to offer specific financial incentives, empower governments to optimize climate policies based on actual data, and facilitate new building technology financing and investment frameworks."

However, expanding our understanding of these systems will help us gain insight into interesting emergent phenomena, including exotic material properties such as superconductivity, as well as the spectra of complex nuclei, which are composed of quarks and gluons at a fundamental level. In nuclear physics, extensive efforts are devoted to computing the properties of increasingly large interacting systems, which requires an exponential amount of resources on classical computers. With the recent advances of quantum information processors, the potential of controllable quantum systems could be harnessed for simulating these complex problems. This work will develop a system consisting of 20~100 singly-charged ions, which are among the leading technologies for quantum computing and simulations.

The topics this project will investigate include non-equilibrium phenomena, for example in heavy-ion collisions, where the rapid generation of entanglement could lead to thermalization. Investigating toy models of these mechanisms on a quantum information processor will shine light on their details with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Current state of the art catalyst design has not directly targeted transition metal complexes capable of mediating the multi-electron redox processes necessary to reduce the overpotential (energy loss) required achieve efficient activation of small molecule substrates. In this vein, a new strategy has been developed for the assembly of polynuclear architectures; allowing for the construction of tunable polymetallic centers that assemble easily within a pre-organized template (conferring stability, selectivity and tunability) that can effect multi-electron redox processes for reactions. Catalyst development has commenced with the following target design elements: (1) catalysts featuring multiple transition metal ions in the same reaction space to greatly expand accessible molecular redox capabilities; (2) catalysts are assembled in a polynucleating ligand framework that permits control over the cluster morphology as well as the local steric and electronic environment of the transition metal ions within the cluster. The high-tunability of the catalyst composition (metal content) and geometric flexibility has permitted a rigorous assessment of electronic-structure-to-function relationship to be developed, further guiding synthetic efforts to realize more potent catalysts. The numerous permutations possible showcase the high degree of generality to this approach with many synthetic handles to tune redox and reaction chemistry. Trinuclear complexes have been synthesized featuring homo- and hetero-trinuclear cores featuring a variety of first row transition metal ions (Cr-Ni). The molecular clusters have been shown to successfully mediate multi-electron redox processes in a cooperative fashion without requiring strong chemical reductants or oxidants. The reactive molecular complexes are being utilized to activate and breakdown the robust bonds within typical waste stream small molecules and convert them into value-added commodity chemicals.

While it is commonly observed that there is a trade-off between the two properties, mechanical deformation studies have shown that it can be achieved by changing the deformation mechanism from slip to twinning if twin boundaries could be induced in the microstructure. On the one hand, twin boundaries act as barriers to dislocations, whereas on the other hand, they provide long and smooth pathways that promote glide of dislocations. Recently, some compositions of multiple principal element alloys (MPEAs), including high entropy alloys (HEAs), are found to possess the unique combination of high strength and high ductility and seem to break away from the normal trade-off trend. In these alloys, the formation of large number of twin boundaries is correlated to their low stacking fault energy (SFE). This lowering of SFE has been further tied to the formation of specific local atomic-level chemistries via segregation at the stacking faults. The objective of this work is to understand the underlying key features at the atomic level that result in lowered SFE. Based on recent results, we hypothesize that the increase in charge density at the stacking fault due to specific atomic chemistry results in reduced SFE. In this proposal, we will focus on Ni-based MPEAs whose deformation twinning and segregation responses have been studied recently. Using atomistic calculations including density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported by machine-learning data-science methods, we will elucidate the effect of specific local nearest-neighbor chemistries that could lower SFE and facilitate twin boundary formation in MPEAs. The successful completion of this project will lead to a fundamental understanding of the correlation between alloy chemistry and twinning. In addition, a machine-learning-based computational approach will be formulated to predict accurate SFE from DFT, which is currently a major bottleneck in DFT. Finally, this work will advance data-science methods applied to materials science, which is a rapidly growing area of national interest."

Martin Bollinger, Jr. and Amie Boal, Penn State University This project aims at an atomistic description of the so-called “ethylene-forming enzyme” (EFE), which catalyzes a unique reaction, wherein the common metabolite, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), is converted to the important commodity chemical, ethylene. EFE is being vigorously leveraged within the biotech industry for novel, solar-driven, carbon-neutral bioprocesses to produce ethylene, one of the most important building blocks of the chemical industry. Insight obtained from the proposed studies could guide the rational design of microbial bioprocesses employing EFE and could therefore impact the world's energy infrastructure and economy. Ethylene is one of the most versatile and broadly used building blocks in polymerization reactions carried out in the chemical industry. It is used for manufacturing of textiles, plastics, solvents and gasoline in the C5-C10 range. Currently, ethylene is produced by steam cracking of fossil fuels in a process that requires vast amounts of energy and has a negative carbon footprint. Therefore, alternative approaches for production of ethylene are being vigorously pursued. An attractive alternative approach for ethylene production involves biotechnology, specifically the use of genetically engineered microorganisms in which the biosynthetic path for ethylene production is imported. The so-called ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE) is an attractive target for these endeavors because it catalyzes the conversion of the common metabolite of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, 2-oxo-glutarate (2OG), to ethylene. EFE belongs to the large group of Fe(II)- and 2OG-dependent oxygenases that couple the decarboxylation of 2OG to succinate and CO2 to the oxidation of their prime substrates, but it is unique in the sense that it is the only Fe/2OG oxygenase which can convert 2OG to ethylene. During the previous funding cycle, we dissected the mechanism of the unusual reaction catalyzed by EFE. Our experimental evidence reveals a hybrid radical-polar mechanism with a second, previously unrecognized branchpoint. The key propionate-3-carbonate intermediate can break down either to ethylene and CO2 or to 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP). 3HP is also an important monomer for the polymer industry. Our observation that EFE can be enticed to generate 3HP from the common metabolite, 2OG, affords the opportunity for synergistic engineering of bioprocesses for both 3HP and ethylene. We will use a combination of biochemical, kinetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic approaches to provide additional knowledge of how EFE controls its reactivity. These experiments could provide important insight for the design of microorganisms for the production of important commodity chemicals."
Functional-Type Modeling Approach and Data-driven Parameterization of Methane Emissions in Wetlands,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,89243020SSC000054,"Ward, Eric",Eric.Ward@usgeologicalsurvey,"['model', 'system', 'material', 'approach', 'new', 'quantum', 'research', 'data']","The role of natural wetland emissions in the recent sharp increase of global methane atmospheric concentration is hotly debated. Difficulties in modeling methane emissions are driven, to a large degree, by the spatially heterogeneous nature of wetland ecosystems and by the high temporal and spatial variability of methane fluxes. This variability in fluxes is a result of the underlying heterogeneity of the wetlands, combined with the complex and interconnected belowground and aboveground processes of methane production, consumption, and transport. Eddy covariance (EC) and chamber flux measurements, and remote sensing of wetlands and atmospheric methane concentrations are routinely used to parameterize and improve land-surface models that predict methane fluxes. However, model optimizations are typically done against observations of the net site-level flux, or coarse atmospheric methane concentration and do not independently address within-wetland heterogeneity or the various processes that add up to the net flux. Therefore, even models that make accurate CH4 emission predictions may be right for the wrong reasons. The goal of this project is to improve simulation of methane emissions from coastal wetlands in the E3SM Land Model (ELM). We will improve ELM along three spatial and conceptual axes: (i) Patch resolution – expand the subgrid surface-tile approach, currently widely utilized in representation of upland vegetation, to represent ecohydrological patch types, such as open-water, mudflats, emergent/floating vegetation, swap forest, etc. (ii) Vertical resolution – provide vertically detailed observations of belowground dissolved methane concentration gradients and utilize ELMs patch-level vertical soil column to resolve methane production, oxidation, and transport at high vertical resolution. (iii) Process resolution – increasing the number, type, and accuracy of independent process representations that combine within the soil column and interact with plants to affect net CH4 emissions. To support these model developments, we propose to expand an already extensive dataset of observations in 4 coastal wetlands along salinity and tidal influence gradient. Observations include flux measurements at multiple scales: whole-site EC fluxes (in 3 sites, already reporting to AmeriFlux), chamber flux measurements at each ecohydrological patch type, bubble accumulations, and methane transport through plants. These measurements will allow us to directly test and parameterize the model at multiple scales, including specific processes resolved at the patch level, and go beyond the typical whole-site parameterization. Observations also include vertical profiles of methane, dissolved organic carbon, oxygen, and temperature in the soil of each patch type, using in-situ dialysis samplers (peepers). Soil cores for chemistry, metagenomic and metatranscriptomics, and methane, and carbon isotope analysis, will provide estimates of the presence and relative importance of the rates of particular microbial processes of production and consumption of methane. We will conduct sets of parameterization, validation, and sensitivity analyses simulations using the PEcAn workflow. After the optimization of the model at our demonstration site, we will use the framework of the Global Carbon Project methane reanalysis simulations to test the sensitivity of global methane emission forecasts to resolving sub-site ecohydrological patches. Our project will significantly improve ELM coastal-wetland methane simulation capabilities by implementing the sub-site ecohydrological patch-type approach, improving process representation, and careful testing and calibration against multi-scale observations. We will demonstrate the process-level multi-scale parameterization approach and provide direct observations to determine and directly constrain parameters within the multiple methane biogeochemical and plant processes represented in ELM. We will demonstrate the need for global within-wetland patch characterization and delineation, and patch-level flux and vertically detailed concentration observations."

Improved design and fabrication methods are needed to reduce cost and allow joining of nuclear-grade SiC-SiC composites for use in gas-cooled and liquid fluoride salt-cooled reactors at high temperatures. Limitations of the existing nuclear grade SiC composites as applied to high- performance nuclear systems include difficulty joining complex geometries and instability of those joints under irradiation, poor initial thermal conductivity and significant conductivity degradation after irradiation, matrix microcracking, and difficulty in producing complex shaped components at low cost. The proposed SiC/SiC composite utilizes a low-cost approach incorporating a combination of SiC nanoparticles with TiC and Y2O3 to enhance joint strength, thermal conductivity, and radiation resistance. During processing, the nanoparticles are infiltrated into a SiC fiber preform, decreasing porosity and increasing conductivity. The fabrication process, consisting of a combination of nanoinfiltration and transient eutectic-phase and chemical vapor infiltration, directly addresses the requirement for low-cost manufacturing, by allowing full net shapes and the capability to be joined. During Phase II, the best fabrication method for creating SiC composites for use in nuclear reactors was developed. These materials and methods resulted in a joined composite material with higher thermal conductivity than currently reported and high mechanical strength and bonding properties. Flat samples were joined and machined into hourglass specimens to be irradiated and tested at an outside laboratory. Simulations were conducted, and the prototype was evaluated for scalability. Based on research and results from Phases I and II, the fabrication method will be optimized and repeatability established. Samples will be irradiated and tested at a partner laboratory. Nuclear tie-rods or other complex shaped and joined parts selected by the project team will be created using the method developed, and tested for irradiation stability. The manufacturing methods will be refined and prototype upscaling will be considered. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits The proposed technology will result in a high-strength, radiation- and temperature-resistant SiC composite able to be joined, and produced at low cost. It will have commercial applications in areas such as structural components and blanket structures for nuclear power plants and fuel cladding (in particular, Generation IV gas-cooled and liquid fluoride salt-cooled reactors), aerospace, and other industries. Finally, a large commercial market is envisioned in aerospace rocket and engine components, which require high-strength, high-temperature, and lightweight materials."

Electrical links, while inexpensive, push against fundamental signal integrity limits and cannot achieve >100Gbps in line rates over a few meters. At the same time, optical solutions remain expensive, making them undesirable in the volumes that data centers and supercomputers require. Silicon photonics is a disruptive technology with the ability to enable >100Gb/s line rates at a cost&shy;effective price point. However, traditional silicon photonic approaches will fall short of the required bandwidth, power, and cost requirements needed for a >1Tbps optical interconnect module. In this program, Ayar Labs is developing a 1.6Tbps optical module technology based on a new approach to silicon photonics developed at MIT, UC Berkeley, and CU Boulder via the DARPA POEM program. This approach uses optical ring resonators as an alternative device to mach zehnder interferometers, to overcome the bandwidth density, power, and cost barriers faced by traditional silicon photonic approaches to network interconnects. In Phase I, Ayar Labs explored new device and circuit designs to bridge the gap between university research devices and a customer&shy;driven technology demonstrations, leading to a link prototype chip sent for manufacturing at the end of Phase I. In Phase II, we will push the performance of the transceiver components, in particular that of the photodetectors and receivers, to the specifications required for the 1.6 Tbps optical transceiver module. In order to achieve this goal, we will perform in&shy;depth parameter extraction of new and existing device designs to foster a deeper understanding of the performance limits of our current devices and develop simulation models for enabling electrical circuit and optical device co&shy;simulation. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits Ayar Labs, Inc. will sell its 1.6Tbps optical module to the owners of supercomputers and warehouse&shy;scale data centers, to enable significant reductions in energy use of these data center systems and higher performance as systems become able to support bigger networks with more connectivity between data center components. In the longer&shy;term, Ayar Labs will sell its technology for high&shy;performance, energy&shy;efficient optical solutions to partner companies to integrate into their products such as switches, routers, processors, memory, and ultimately even mobile and internet&shy;of&shy;things devices."
