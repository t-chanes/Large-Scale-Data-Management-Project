NV Diamond Sensing for Neutron Electric Dipole Moment Experiments,Office of Nuclear Physics,DE-SC0023666,"Beck, Douglas",Douglas.Beck@boardoftrusteesoftheuniversityofillinois,"['learning', 'new', 'thermodynamic', 'system', 'photonic', 'computing', 'network', 'memory']","The electric dipole moments (EDMs) of elementary particles have never been observed experimentally. However, we know the values they would have—so far, we do not have the experimental precision to observe their small size. Nevertheless, we continue to make improvements in EDM experiments because of what they could potentially teach us about the elementary science of the very shortest distance scales. For example, the existence of the EDM implies a rare violation of time reversal symmetry—simply the idea that a “movie” of a subatomic process sometimes looks different when played in reverse. We know nothing about the origin of this property, although it seems to be a natural effect when looking at nature on the very smallest length scales. Furthermore, it appears to be a necessary part of the early universe mechanisms that led to the preponderance of matter over anti-matter in our current observations of the cosmos. With one notable extension, EDM experiments are performed in much the same way as an MRI at a hospital where a precession frequency is determined. In addition to the magnetic field in a standard MRI measurement, we add a strong electric field. If the particle in question has an EDM in addition to the magnetic dipole moment that most particles possess, the EDM will change the precession rate ever so slightly (at roughly the one in 10 billion level). In such experiments, we place strong emphasis on the statistical precision, but also on systematic errors that could creep in. This is where the electric and magnetic field sensors come in. They are critical tools for monitoring changes in the fields that can generate false EDMs. The sensors we will develop as part of this project are based on synthetic diamonds that have a certain type of impurity. The structure of this defect allows us to prepare, in effect, an “artificial atom”. In addition to responding to magnetic fields, which many atoms do, these artificial atoms also respond to electric fields allowing us to make use of them to monitor both electric and magnetic in the vicinity of the measurement cells. The best resolution that we can obtain in our simple setup is by utilizing a quantum mechanical interference phenomenon. The quantum state so-produced has a relatively long lifetime which in turn implies that the width of this line in the energy space is relatively very narrow, allowing for very precise measurements. There exist numerous suggestions in the literature to advance even this favorable situation—including dynamical decoupling, spin squeezing, use of isotopically pure carbon to manufacture diamonds These represent some of the directions we will consider in this project."
Elastic Emission Machining of Optics for Structural Biology Imaging Using Fluid Jet Polishing,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0023605,"Rinkus, Michael",Michael.Rinkus@optiprosystems,"['learning', 'new', 'thermodynamic', 'system', 'photonic', 'computing', 'network', 'memory']","Elastic Emission Machining of Optics for Structural Biology Imaging Using Fluid Jet Polishing-OptiPro Systems, 6368 Dean Parkway, Ontario, NY 14519 Rinkus, Michael, Principal Investigator, mrinkus@optipro.com Apolito, Nancy, Business Official, napolito@optipro.com Amount: $250,000 Synchrotron light sources have continuously and impressively grown in brightness and beam quality since their inception in 1947 at General Electric in upstate New York [1]. Indeed, we are at the point where X-ray synchrotron light sources have been optimized to the Diffraction Limit and Free Electron Lasers (FEL) have been fully developed. Nonetheless, ongoing manufacturing and metrology challenges associated with beamline focusing mirrors prevent the light sources from reaching their full potential. While the average brightness of synchrotron radiation sources is increasing, the utilization of this increase in brightness is held back by the quality of the beamline optics [2]. Currently, OptiPro has a Phase I SBIR underway for increasing the surface quality of specific beamline optics utilizing Elastic Emission Machining (EEM) to polish Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) mirrors. In this proposal we present an exciting ultra-precision optics polishing method based on the EEM method that, we believe, will greatly improve the surface figure and roughness of the other X-ray mirrors used in those beamlines, specifically the interior surfaces of the Wolter Mirrors. The current EEM method is not capable of polishing these interior surfaces, but a novel Fluid Jet Polishing Elastic Emission Machining (FJPEEM) system proposed herein, will be capable of just that. By improving the surface figure quality and roughness of all types of X-ray mirrors in the system, more accurate experimentation can be done for studying the structural biology of microbial and plant systems, especially those relevant to bioenergy."
Ultrasonic Imaging of Mechanical Degradation In Superconducting Magnets,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0022701,"Borigo, Cody","Cody.Borigo@fbs,inc.","['magnet', 'training', 'computing', 'superconducting', 'energy', 'neuromorphic', 'analog', 'task']","Ultrasonic Imaging of Mechanical Degradation In Superconducting Magnets-FBS, Inc., 450 Rolling Ridge Dr, Bellefonte, PA 16823-2503 Borigo, Cody, Principal Investigator, cborigo@gwultrasonics.com Miller, Jaimie, Business Official, jmiller@gwultrasonics.com Amount: $199,697 Superconducting magnets are a key component in particle accelerators and other devices. However, a phenomenon of “training” has baffled superconducting magnet designers for over 50 years. Training usually refers to a process of gradually improving maximal current that the superconducting high-field magnet can sustain. At the maximal current the magnet would develop resistance and quickly release is stored energy in a process called “quenching”. Repetitive quenching typically leads to a gradual increase of the quench current. Since in practice dozens of quenches may be needed to reach the magnet design current, training is a costly and time-consuming procedure that every newly constructed magnet has to undergo prior to its intended use. Reduction of training is thus one of the key standing problems in the field. It is believed that mechanical degradation of coil materials such as epoxy impregnation cracking and de-lamination along the conductor interfaces play a crucial role in defining length of training and performance limitations. An ability to non-destructively localize and identify these mechanical flaws in magnets would provide a valuable insight for magnet designers and help them to better understand and mitigate training. Present project aims at developing such diagnostic capability using ultrasonic diagnostics. Ultrasonic testing is a proven technique for non-destructively evaluating and imaging flaws within a wide range of complex structures, and the proposing small business has extensive experience solving challenging NDE problems using novel ultrasonic methods. For this project, the proposing firm will partner with a national research laboratory to explore various ultrasonic approaches including high-frequency, conventional, “bulk wave” ultrasound as well as lower-frequency “guided wave” ultrasound in both pulse-echo and through-transmission test configurations scanning from the outside of the magnet and from within the core. The proposing team will leverage superconducting magnet specimens with known mechanical flaws as well as the subject matter expertise available at the research institution to develop practical solutions for this application. The primary objective of the proposed SBIR/STTR effort is to develop an ultrasonic scanning method(s) applied from within the magnet core and from outside the magnet shell that is capable of characterizing the presence, location, extent, type, and severity of the mechanical degradation. The research institution will provide access to superconducting magnet specimens with varying degrees of mechanical degradation as well as invaluable subject matter expertise on the design and operation of the magnets. The small business will utilize a variety of bulk wave and guided wave scanning methods to identify the best solution for imaging the degradation in the magnets; this will include synthetic aperture focusing scans, phased array scans, and through-transmission guided wave scans. The research institution will conduct pre-/post-test visual imaging to characterize the mechanical degradation and compare this to the ultrasonic results. A prototype scanner will be developed based on the most successful technique(s). The proposing team has used a similar approach to successfully solve various non-destructive testing challenges in previous SBIR/STTR projects. The phenomenon of “training” has baffled superconducting magnet designers for over 50 years and is a costly and time-consuming procedure that every newly-constructed magnet must undergo prior to its intended use. Reduction of training is thus one of the key standing problems in the field. An ability to non- destructively localize and identify these mechanical flaws in magnets would provide a valuable insight for magnet designers and help them to better understand and mitigate training. Reducing superconducting magnet training could yield significant cost reductions for manufacturers. This benefit would not only be applicable to DOE applications in high- energy physics, such as fusion reactors and particle accelerators, but also to the many applications of superconducting magnets in the public sector. These applications include medical MRI machines, NMR equipment, mass spectrometers, magnetic separation processes, and superconducting maglev trains, among others."
Non-Invasive Imaging of Nitrogen Assimilation in the Rhizosphere via Quantum-Entangled Hyperpolarized Spin States,Office of Biological & Environmental Research,DE-SC0023334,"Theis, Thomas",Thomas.Theis@northcarolinastateuniversity,"['technology', 'quantum', 'non', 'metabolic', 'imaging', 'study', 'plant', 'chemical']","N-fertilizer synthesis for agriculture sustains about half of the human population. Recent studies show that nitrogen input from N-fertilizer synthesis and river runoff will pose a serious and growing problem with intensifying climate change. Excessive fertilization also leads to the release of considerable amounts of nitrous oxide into the atmosphere posing additional aggravating challenges to the bioenergy balance of modern society. To address these major societal challenges, improvements to today’s agricultural strategies are necessary. Here we aim to develop a new, non-invasive quantum sensing approach to directly observe metabolic transformation in the rhizosphere to acquire currently inaccessible knowledge. We propose a quantum spin technology to image biochemical pathways in the rhizosphere with unprecedented chemical detail and sensitivity. Specifically, the proposed technology transfers the quantum entangled nuclear spin order of hydrogen gas, to metabolites, including nitrate, amino acids and pyruvate, to enable molecular imaging of their metabolic transformations without any penetration depth limitations such that molecular turnover and metabolism can be observed directly in soil. We will conduct proof-of-concept demonstrations of our quantum sensing approach to study nitrogen assimilation of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula). M. truncatula is a model legume for biological nitrogen fixation mediated by rhizobia and symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi which transport nutrients, including nitrate, to the plant. In return, rhizobia and AM fungi receive fixed carbon from the plant. However, there is no technology to date that can track individual metabolic events non-invasively in unperturbed soil to answer some of the most important questions about which metabolic pathways the molecules actually follow. After establishing this new quantum sensing approach to molecular imaging on roots, it can be applied to any plant of interest to study their molecular machinery. Current technology designed to non-invasively monitor the metabolic turnover of naturally occurring biomolecules in plants, roots or smaller model systems faces major obstacles. In case of optical techniques, obstacles include optical penetration depth limitations and chemical specificity. In contrast to optical techniques, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are well-established non-invasive techniques that easily report on small changes in chemical structure and perform non-invasive imaging. However, NMR, and even more so MRI, are notoriously insensitive, require large samples and high concentrations, therefore the study of low-concentration metabolites remains out of reach. With quantum entangled sources of nuclear spin order, parahydrogen in particular, we overcome current technological shortcomings and achieve sensitivity gains of up to seven orders of magnitude, which promise tracking of low concentration metabolites and their chemical transformations deep inside soil. With succesfull completion of our aims we will have established a new quantum technology for non-invasive imaging of nitrogen assimilation in the rhizosphere. This implies that the same technology can be used to understand many other metabolic pathways that are not easily accessible today. Ultimately, this technology will help produce crops that increase carbon uptake in soil, helping to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and decreasing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions."
Photonics at Thermodynamic Limits,Office of Basic Energy Sciences,DE-SC0019140,"Dionne, Jennifer",Jennifer.Dionne@boardoftrusteesofthelelandstanfordjunioruniversity,"['learning', 'new', 'thermodynamic', 'system', 'photonic', 'computing', 'network', 'memory']","Thermodynamic cycles interconvert heat and mechanical work and provide the foundation for many energy conversion and computing processes. While most thermodynamic cycles rely on a classical fluid, the Photonics at Thermodynamic Limits Energy Frontier Research Center (PTL-EFRC) envisions thermodynamic cycles based on light. Light can be completely converted to heat at the same temperature; in turn, that heat can be completely converted to light at the same effective temperature. Such photon-based Carnot cycles would create remarkable opportunities for energy conversion, including all-optical energy-storage, optical cooling and refrigeration, and beyond von-Neumann information architectures. Though such photon-driven thermodynamic processes have long been theorized, optical systems typically exhibit efficiencies far too low to make photon-driven thermodynamic processes possible. Since 2018, the PTL EFRC has made major and well-recognized advances in creating optical materials with ever-increasing photonic efficiency, establishing a foundation for photonic thermodynamic cycles. We have developed nanoparticles and 2D materials with record quantum yields and near-unity reflection and absorption, and advanced ab-initio theory and new atomic-scale and ultrafast optical characterization tools to unravel the electron dynamics that lead to radiative losses. With these insights, the PTL pioneered photonic thermodynamic systems including world-record-efficiency thermophotovoltaic cells, luminescent solar concentrators, photonic voltage transformers for power electronics, light-driven propulsion schemes, and radiative energy harvesting and cooling. In this project, we will explore nonlinear photonic materials processes, providing a foundation for optically-powered neuromorphic, memristive, refrigerative, and energy storage architectures, and reversible computing with no entropy generation. Our bold mission demands a multi-faceted EFRC-level effort where theory provides insights to guide materials synthesis and energy conversion systems that are in turn validated by state-of-the-art characterization at the nanometer to atomic scale with ultrafast time resolution. To pioneer photonic thermodynamic cycles, we have assembled an integrated, collaborative team of 10 faculty spanning 5 departments at Stanford, Berkeley, Caltech, and UCLA. The PTL-EFRC will be directed by Prof. J. A. Dionne and centered at its lead institution, Stanford University. Members of our EFRC contribute leading expertise in photonics, materials synthesis, theory and measurement science. The PTL-EFRC is organized into three research groups (RGs) that each span multiple institutional partners. RG1, Atomically Precise Photonic Materials, will identify the limits of photonic processes using novel quantum-electrodynamic and first-principles calculations and synthesize new materials that approach thermodynamic and quantum limits. RG2, Optical Characterization with Atomic and Ultrafast Resolution, will develop methods to correlate structure-to-function with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. And RG3, Photonic Thermodynamic Systems, will design photonic energy conversion systems that exploit photonic operations at thermodynamic limits. These RGs serve our scientific objectives, which are strongly resonant with DOE priority research needs, grand challenges, and transformative opportunities. The expected PTL-EFRC outcomes are: i) new forms of matter, suggested by theoretical insights and synthesized with atomic precision, that achieve unprecedented levels of optical efficiency; ii) new foundational understanding of the thermodynamic and quantum limits to excited state generation and lifetime in atomically-architected optical materials, informed by theory and ultrafast/nanoscale characterization methods; iii) development of new theoretical methods to describe optically excited states and processes; iv) development of new methods to determine optical efficiency and observe excited state relaxation processes with unprecedented detail; and v) a set of photonic thermodynamic cycles that use light as the working fluid and perform work with an efficiency approaching the Carnot efficiency."

Acellent is developing an integrated AUTO-SMART sensor system for the automotive industry. The focus will be on the development of 2 multifunctionalities: Pedestrian Protection System (PPS) - development of a complete low-cost PPS that is fast to install during automobile manufacturing and satisfies both the time and accuracy requirements for a proposed sensory system for pedestrian protection; Battery monitoring system (BMS) - to optimize battery performance and lifespan, a battery monitoring system (BMS) will be developed to determine State of Health (SOH), State of Charge (SOC) and End of Life estimation.

Acellent designed the sensor layout for car bumpers and identified potential low cost materials for use in the system. Sensors were manufactured and tested and a prototype PPS demonstrated in the laboratory for use in identification of non-pedestrian vs pedestrian impacts.

Round, multifilament, superconducting wire made from bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (Bi2212) powder exhibits great promise to achieve the performance required for accelerator magnet applications. One of the challenges to large scale deployment of high-temperature superconducting technologies such as Bi2212 magnets is that the wire must undergo over-pressure heat treatment to achieve the high engineering critical current values needed to achieve desired performance metrics. The performance of the Bi2212 superconducting wire is extremely sensitive to minor temperature gradients experienced during the over-pressure heat treatment process. Optimization of the powder properties and fabrication parameters will enable a broader temperature window for wire processing that delivers high performance of the resultant Bi2212 wire. Building upon its expertise in the production of high-performance powders, the Small Business has developed a consistent methodology to produce Bi2212 powder that, when used to produce Bi2212 wire, demonstrates excellent performance. During Phases I and II of this project, the Small Business produced multiple batches of Bi2212 powder with variations in phase composition (including dopants), particle characteristics (specific surface area), and processing parameters. One Subcontractor used the powders to fabricate monocore tapes (Phase I) and round, multifilament wires (Phase II). The tapes and wires were then subjected to over-pressure heat treatment by another collaborator. The engineering critical current values were determined as a function of the temperature window for processing. Further research and development of the Bi2212 powders during a Phase IIA project will build upon the successes achieved during Phases I and II. The Small Business will continue exploration of the material phase space (i.e., cation composition), as well as powder processing parameters that affect particle size and phase distribution. An additional Subcontractor will join the project in order to construct and evaluate a prototype high-field magnet using Bi2212 superconducting wires made from powders developed and produced by the Small Business. Commercial applications include state-of-the-art systems for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The higher magnetic fields enabled by the newly developed Bi2212 materials will facilitate advanced precision, speed, and resolution from these instruments. Fusion energy is also a potential beneficiary from this technology."
Real-Time Neuromorphic Processing of Spatiotemporal Data for Scientific Discovery,Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research,DE-SC0021319,"Li, Peng","Peng.Li@regentsoftheuniversityofcalifornia,santabarbara","['magnet', 'training', 'computing', 'superconducting', 'energy', 'neuromorphic', 'analog', 'task']","Thanks to recent advances, energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware based on digital, analog, and emerging nanoscale devices have emerged. On the other hand, there has been a growing need in processing large volumes of spatiotemporal data in domains such as biological and environmental sciences, climate modeling, energy and physical sciences -- areas targeted by DOE’s scientific computing/HPC mission. This proposal centers about exploiting analog neuromorphic computing in its explicit form of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for energy-efficient real-time learning and processing of spatiotemporal data to accelerate scientific discovery. While spatiotemporal processing is inherent in SNNs, spiking neural computation is yet to find its way to real-world applications including scientific computing. We recognize three major roadblocks for neuromorphic computing. 1) SNN architecture of computation: SNN models are often hand tuned for specific tasks. Lack of unifying spiking neural network architectures hampers the application of neuromorphic computing across diverse domains. 2) High-performance training: existing SNN training algorithms such as biologically-plausible spike-timing dependent plasticity, which lack a globally-defined learning objective, are unable to deliver competitive performance for challenging learning tasks. 3) Analog neuromorphic processors (ANPs): CMOS and emerging device based ANPs offer promising energy efficiency. However, large-scale exploitation of ANPs is contingent upon overcoming the challenges in 1) and 2), limited analog computation precision, and performance degradation due to high sensitivity to parametric variations and device failures. This work aims at a spike-based analog neuromorphic computing framework to enable energy-efficient real-time learning and processing of spatiotemporal data to accelerate scientific discovery via five research tasks. The first task concerns of the development of a unifying SNN architecture comprising composible compute fabrics and connectivity to allow for rich and tunable neural computation. The second task will address the training challenge of analog neuromorphic computing by developing accurate end-to-end unsupervised and supervised off-line training methods. The developed methods will be exploited for training the proposed unifying SNN architecture for targeted applications. In the third task, we will model CMOS and nanoscale memristive device based ANPs for assessing the achievable performance and energy efficiency of such systems. The fourth task will develop few-shot online training to refine the SNN models mapped onto a modeled ANP and trained using the proposed offline techniques. The few-shot online training will use a small amount of data to ensure learning performance in the presence of unknown device parametric variations and failures. The fifth task will perform comprehensive evaluation of the proposed analog neuromorphic computing framework based on spatiotemporal learning tasks arising from scientific discovery including clustering, pattern recognition, anomaly/change detection, and predictive learning. This work will lead to innovations in architectures of spiking neural computation, training methods, and energy-efficient analog neuromorphic computing systems. The comprehensive evaluation of the proposed work will assess the energy efficiency, throughput, accuracy, and scalability of analog neuromorphic computing as it is applied to scientific discovery and provide guidance to the development of new brain-inspired computing hardware that may significantly outperform the current mainstream computing paradigms."

Grant applications are sought to develop new or improved superconducting wire for high field magnetsthatoperateat16Tesla(T)fieldandhigher.The needis for strands that operate at 15 to 25 T. Nb3Sn is still the primary superconductor being used for the HL-LHC project, and is presently considered as the baseline superconductor for the Future Circular Collider (FCC) design study. The minimum target non-Cu Jc for a potential FCC should be greater than 1500 A/mm2 at 16T-4.2K and 2000 A/mm2 at 15T-4.2K. The above target performance is much beyond the present state-of-the-art. There is a need for a 40% improvement of Jc.Our current APC Nb3Sn wires with Ta and Zr doping gave Birrs and Bc2s of up to 28 T, meeting or exceeding those of the best ternary Nb3Sn conductors. The non-Cu Jc of these new Ta-doped APC conductors are above 1500 A/mm2 at 16 T/4.2 K, surpassing the target of the CERN FCC. For our record breaking non-Cu Jc performance of achieving over 1500 A/mm2 at 16T-4.2K, it is important to ensure proper strand performance under deformation, as well as overall conductor robustness, RRR, and long length uniformity. In this Phase IIA, we will focus on exploring strand design considerations aimed at increasing the strand RRR and deformation tolerance while scaling up billet size. One goal is the ability of the strand to undergo the standard Rutherford cabling process without significant degradation. In the Phase IIA we propose new ways to optimize this APC strand design including filament shapes and barrier materialselection.We will demonstrate high Jc athighfieldsandlongpiecelengthwithsubelementsof45mm or less with high performance. The other commercial applications of this advanced Nb3Sn strands are high field 7-11T MRI, NMR systems, superconducting accelerators - protron radiation for cancer treatment, SMES, and high field magnetic separation. According to a U.S. EPA article, more than 97% of the 15,000 accelerators in use around the world have commercial applications, e.g. in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the locating of oil and minerals in the earth, the processing of semiconductor chips for computers, the determination of the age of materials through radiocarbon dating, the sterilizing of medical equipment and food products."
Switched-Field Surface NMR for Enhanced Detection and Resolution of Shallow Groundwater,Office of SBIR/STTR Programs,DE-SC0019671,"Walsh, David",David.Walsh@vistaclarainc.,"['groundwater', 'field', 'resolution', 'technology', 'imaging', 'project', 'phase', 'data']","Switched-Field Surface NMR for Enhanced Detection and Resolution of Shallow Groundwater—Vista Clara, Inc., 12201 Cyrus Way, Suite 104, Mukilteo, WA 98275-5735 Elliot Grunewald, Principal Investigator, elliot@vista-clara.com David Walsh, Business Official, davewalsh@vista-clara.com Amount: $1,549,993 This proposal addresses the challenge of mapping groundwater and hydrogeologic parameters in the subsurface, with a focus on improving sensitivity and spatial resolution for shallow groundwater targets. We will apply imaging methodologies at the core of medical MRI to efficiently map shallow groundwater and hydrogeologic properties at improved resolution. Conventional surface NMR has been proven as a powerful non-invasive technique for coarse groundwater imaging. The method is limited, however, by simplistic imaging protocols. To enhance sensitivity and spatial resolution, we will introduce “switched-field” NMR. This new paradigm combines gradient and prepolarization fields to allow localization of signals based on their frequency and phase response and will increase the signal-to-noise ratio for shallow water. In addition to improving resolution, these approaches will also accelerate measurement speed allowing the technology to be applied in a wider range of environments and markets. Having established feasibility in Phase 1, the Phase 2 work will fully develop and commercialize the use of switched fields for groundwater imaging. In the first task, we will complete a comprehensive framework for the forward modelling, processing, and interpretation of switched field data. These simulations will also be used to evaluate novel acquisition and processing methodologies improving upon those explored in Phase 1. In the second task, a complete system will be developed for commercial sale, including robust, modular, and lower cost power electronics, next-generation data acquisition interfacing and control, as well as customer-facing software for user-friendly survey planning, data acquisition, and data interpretation. In the final task, the developed technology will be validated and demonstrated in a large number of field project, including local test sites, government environmental research projects, and commercial geotechnical projects. Completion of this technology will deliver a powerful groundwater imaging product for commercial sale, rental, and/or services in the environmental, geotechnical, and subsurface research markets. This technology will be of value to companies, governments, and public agencies facing problems such as groundwater contamination, dewatering for geotechnical engineering, and permafrost mapping. The ability to image at high-resolution in with reduced survey times will improve the reliability of subsurface models, reduce site characterization costs, support informed decision making. In turn, this technology will improve project efficiency, reduce risk, and result in improved outcomes."
