# Data Archive: Unused, Failed, and Test Data
This repository contains an archive of data that was used for testing, not used in the final analysis, or failed during processing for the Project Trace data cleaning and processing pipeline. The purpose of this archive is to provide a record of the data sources that were considered and to facilitate future analysis, troubleshooting, or development.

## Structure
The data archive consists of the following files:

### Test Data
* ET_LDA_ABSTRACT.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing an initial version of LDA topic modeling.
* ET_LDA_TOK_STEM_STOPX.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing an initial version of LDA topic modeling with tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.

### Unused Data
* 693TitleImages_1.2GBs: A collection of images associated with project titles.
* NSF_partial_output.csv: Partially processed NSF data.
* tweets5.zip: Archived tweets related to Topic 5.
* tweets6.zip: Archived tweets related to Topic 6.
* tweets_Topic2_Eddie.csv: Tweets related to Topic 2.
* tweets_topic7_tharun.zip: Archived tweets related to Topic 7.
* tweets_topic9_Tharun.zip: Archived tweets related to Topic 9.

### Failed Data
* NIHImageScraperResults - 10.8GB.txt: Results from an NIH image scraper that failed during processing.

### Miscellaneous
* DOE_final.py: A Python script for processing DOE data.
* DOE_final.xlsx: Final processed DOE data in Excel format.
* Google_scraper.py: A Python script for scraping Google search results.
* Merged_data_DOE3_NIH5_NSF7_15DF.csv: Merged data from DOE, NIH, and NSF.
* NSF_DIBBS_exportedNewsTEST.zip: Archived news articles related to NSF DIBBS projects.
* NSF_DIBBS_final2_output.csv: Processed NSF DIBBS data (version 2).
* NSF_DIBBS_final3_output.csv: Processed NSF DIBBS data (version 3).
* NSF_DIBBS_final_output.csv: Processed NSF DIBBS data (version 1).
* NIH_all_final.zip: Archived final processed NIH data.
* README_Old.md: The old README file for the repository.
* Web application Security Testing: A file related to security testing of the web application.
* topics.txt: A text file containing topics for analysis.
* website.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook related to the development of a web application.
* website.py: A Python script related to the development of a web application.

### Usage
To explore the data in the archive, you can view or analyze the files using appropriate tools based on their file format (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks can be opened in a Jupyter environment, CSV files can be opened using spreadsheet software or loaded into a Python script using the pandas library)

### Contributing
